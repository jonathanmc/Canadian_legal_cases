  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal involves the application of the test for
    assumed jurisdiction as reformulated in <i>Van
    Breda v. Village Resorts Limited</i> (2010), 98 O.R. (3d) 721 (C.A.), leave to
    appeal to S.C.C. granted, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 174, in the context of Internet-based
    libel actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants appeal from the order of Belobaba J.
    dated March 31, 2009, confirming that Ontario has jurisdiction and is the
    appropriate and convenient forum for the respondents actions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Conrad Black, filed six libel actions
    in the Ontario Superior Court, in respect of statements posted on the Hollinger
    International, Inc. (Hollinger International) website. The defendants in the
    actions are directors, advisors and a Vice President of Hollinger International.
    Black alleges that press releases and reports issued by the defendants
    contained defamatory statements that were downloaded, read and republished in
    Ontario by The Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, and the National Post, and
    damaged his reputation in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants brought a motion to stay the actions on
    the ground that the Ontario court did not have jurisdiction, or alternatively that
    Ontario was not the convenient forum. The defendants argued that there was no
    real and substantial connection between Ontario and the actions, and that the
    more appropriate forum was either New York or Illinois. The motion judge
    disagreed and dismissed the defendants motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge applied the test for assumed
    jurisdiction as set out in <i>Muscutt v.
    Courcelles </i>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.). Subsequent to his decision, this
    court modified the <i>Muscutt</i> test in <i>Van Breda</i>.  The hearing of this appeal was deferred
    pending the release of the reasons for decision in <i>Van Breda</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two issues in this appeal: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1. Was the motion judge correct in
    concluding that Ontario could assume jurisdiction in light of the test as set
    out in <i>Van Breda</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2. Did the motion judge err in
    principle in determining that there was no clearly more convenient forum?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conrad Black is a well-known business figure who
    established a reputation first in Canada and then internationally as a
    newspaper owner and publisher. The defendants are the directors, advisors and a
    Vice President of Hollinger International. One defendant lives in Ontario,
    another in Israel and the remaining eight defendants live, or are headquartered,
    in five different U.S. jurisdictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until January 2004, Black was Chairman of Hollinger
    International, a publicly traded Delaware company headquartered at different
    times in New York or Chicago. Black and his associates effectively controlled Hollinger
    International through two Ontario companies, Hollinger Inc. and The Ravelston
    Corporation Limited (Ravelston Corp). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the spring of 2003, a minority shareholder of
    Hollinger International complained about the legitimacy of non-compete and management
    service payments that had been made to Black, his associates and to entities
    he owned or controlled. The Hollinger International Board of Directors
    established a Special Committee to investigate the allegations made in the
    complaints. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Special Committee concluded that certain payments
    Black, other individuals and entities received from Hollinger International
    were not properly authorized. In August 2004, the Special Committee completed a
    report, which, pursuant to a U.S. Consent Order, was provided to the U.S.
    District Court and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<b> </b>The
    Consent Order was in relation to an injunctive complaint filed by the U.S. SEC
    against Hollinger International in Illinois.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Black brought these libel actions between February 2004
    and March 2005. Two of the actions include a claim for conspiracy to injure. Although
    the actions initially claimed damages to Blacks reputation world-wide, the
    actions are now restricted to publication in Ontario and to damages to his reputation
    in Ontario. Black has undertaken not to bring any libel action for publication
    of the statements in these actions in any other jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The libel suits relate to items posted on the Hollinger
    International website, including press releases about the Special Committee investigation
    and the legal disputes that followed; the report of the Special Committee; and a
    summary of the findings of the Special Committee and related risks in the
    companys annual securities law form. Hollinger Internationals website was
    accessible in Canada. The press releases provided media, explicitly including
    Canadian media, with contact information. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statements allege that Black, his associates,
    Hollinger Inc. and Ravelston Corp. improperly took hundreds of millions of
    dollars from Hollinger International. The report states that [t]he Special
    Committee knows of few parallels to [Blacks] brand of self-righteous, and
    aggressive looting of Hollinger to the exclusion of all other concerns or
    interests; that Black as both CEO and controlling shareholder... created an
    entity in which ethical corruption was a defining characteristic of the
    leadership team; that the evidence... establishes an overwhelming record of
    abuse, overreaching and violations of fiduciary duties by Black; and that he
    made it his business to line [his] pockets at the expense of Hollinger almost
    every day, in almost every way. The releases or reports suggest that Black had
    committed tax evasion and breached U.S. securities law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blacks actions have been the subject of civil and
    criminal actions and regulatory proceedings in the United States and Canada. Numerous
    claims and counterclaims between Hollinger International, Black and other
    related parties were brought in Delaware and Illinois. In the outstanding
    Illinois action brought by Hollinger International, allegations concerning millions
    in unauthorized management fee and non-compete payments were being actively
    litigated when the action was stayed pending the completion of the criminal
    proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shareholder class actions were also commenced in
    Illinois and several Canadian provinces, including Ontario. These class actions
    have settled. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Ontario Superior Court, Hollinger International brought
    an action against Hollinger Inc. and Ravelston Corp., seeking to recover
    Hollinger Internationals documents and property held in Ontario at the
    corporations premises.  Ravelston Corp. brought
    a motion for an anti-suit injunction restraining Hollinger International from
    bringing or continuing any claims arising from the management of the Hollinger group
    of companies in any jurisdiction outside Ontario. The motion included a request
    for an injunction restraining Hollinger International from continuing against
    Ravelston Corp. the Illinois action. The motion judge dismissed the motion for
    anti-suit injunction noting that the Illinois forum was favoured, and granted
    Hollinger Internationals cross-motion requesting a temporary stay of the
    counterclaims. In October 2006, Hollinger International (by this time known as
    Sun-Times Media Group Inc.) also brought an action in Ontario for a <i>mareva</i> injunction relying upon claims
    made in the Illinois action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2007, Black was acquitted of some and convicted
    of other criminal charges. The appellate process is ongoing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I:         DOES ONTARIO HAVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR
    THE ACTIONS?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether Ontario has jurisdiction to hear this action is
    a question of law and the standard of review is correctness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The test for
    assumed jurisdiction: <i>Van Breda</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Van Breda, </i>this
    court reviewed the <i>Muscutt</i> test and modified
    and refined the test to provide for clarity and ease of application (paras. 70,
    83 and 109). Sharpe J.A. noted the importance of maintaining the distinction
    between legal jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i>,
    an inquiry that does not turn upon a comparison with the strength of the
    connection with another potentially available jurisdiction, and the
    discretionary test for <i>forum non
    conveniens</i> (paras. 82 and 109). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A. identified the core of the real and
    substantial connection test as the connection that the plaintiffs claim has to
    the forum and the connection of the defendant to the forum. The remaining considerations
    or principles should not be treated as independent factors but as analytical
    tools to assist the court in assessing the significance of the connections
    between the forum, the claim and the defendant (paras. 84 and 109). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A. determined that as a first stage, a real
    and substantial connection is presumed to exist for the purposes of assuming
    jurisdiction against a foreign defendant, if the case falls within one of the
    connections set out in the rule for service outside Ontario<i>,</i> r. 17.02 of the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i>, excepting subrules (h) (damages sustained in Ontario) and
    (o) (a necessary or proper party) (paras. 72 and 109). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a real and substantial connection is presumed to
    exist, the defendant bears the burden of showing that a real and substantial
    connection does not exist in the specific circumstances of the case. Where no
    presumption is established, the burden falls on the plaintiff to show that the
    real and substantial connection test is met. At this second stage, the core of
    the analysis rests upon the connection between Ontario and the plaintiffs
    claim and the defendant, respectively (para. 109).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The consideration of the fairness of assuming or
    refusing jurisdiction, is not a free-standing factor capable of trumping weak
    connections, but rather is an analytic tool to assess the relevance, quality
    and strength of the connections between the forum, the plaintiffs claim and
    the defendant (paras. 96-98 and 109).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The involvement of other parties to the suit is relevant
    only in cases where it is asserted as a possible (not a presumptive) connecting
    factor that may justify jurisdiction (paras. 102 and 109). The courts
    willingness to recognize and enforce an extra-provincial judgment against an
    Ontario defendant rendered on the same jurisdictional basis is not a separate
    factor but remains as a general and overarching principle that disciplines the assumption
    of jurisdiction over extra-provincial defendants (paras. 103 and 109). The
    interprovincial or international nature of the case, comity and the standards
    of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement prevailing elsewhere, are general
    principles of private international law that bear upon the interpretation and
    application of the real and substantial connection test (paras. 106-109).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The motion
    judges decision</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that almost all of the <i>Muscutt</i> factors favoured Black. Specifically,
    he found that the alleged tort occurred in Ontario. He further concluded that
    the defendants would have been aware, or ought to have been aware, of some of
    Blacks many ties to Ontario or that he had established a significant
    reputation in this jurisdiction. He concluded that the defendants knew, or
    ought to have known, that the statements would be of considerable interest to
    people and media in Ontario, and would be published and republished by
    newspapers in Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge did not consider that it would be
    unfair to proceed in Ontario, given his finding that the downloading and injury
    to Blacks reputation in Ontario was reasonably foreseeable. He also noted that
    it would be unfair to deny Black the opportunity to vindicate his reputation in
    a jurisdiction that is very important to him. Despite the international nature
    of the action and the unenforceability of any judgment in the United States,
    the motion judge found that there was value to Black in proceeding in Ontario.
    He concluded that the <i>Muscutt</i> factors
    favoured the assumption of jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The positions of
    the parties</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that there is no real and substantial
    connection between Blacks claims and Ontario or between the defendants and
    Ontario. They further submit that the motion judge erred by failing to have
    regard to the principles of order, fairness and jurisdictional restraint that
    underlie the real and substantial connection test and by engaging in a
    mechanical tallying of the factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that the motion judge erred in
    finding the alleged tort was committed in Ontario. The view that Internet-based
    defamation occurs anywhere and everywhere the material is accessed, they argue,
    must be rejected. In the alternative, they submit that the place where the
    statement is downloaded or republished by third parties and where reputation is
    damaged is not a reliable indicator of a real and substantial connection to
    that jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the defendants position that the motion judge
    erred in focusing on the connections between Black and Ontario, rather than on
    the connections between the claims and Ontario. The claims in this proceeding
    arise out of statements involving the governance of an American corporation, made
    by its directors, officers and advisors and posted on its website in the U.S. Further,
    other than one defendant, the defendants have no connection to Ontario and their
    actions did not occur in Ontario. The defendants argue that it would be unfair
    to assume jurisdiction against the defendants in this case merely because they
    ought to reasonably have contemplated being called upon in the jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blacks position is that the analysis of the motion
    judge remains sound. Although the court has altered the weight of certain
    factors, the motion judge considered the correct factors and his decision
    should be affirmed. The motion judge found that the factors that now constitute
    the core factors favoured Black. Black submits that the fairness factor and
    the general overarching principles in the <i>Van
    Breda</i> test also favour the assumption of jurisdiction. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>1.         Is there a presumption of a real and
    substantial connection on the ground
    that the case falls within a connection specified in r. 17.02? </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Black submits that a real and substantial connection is
    presumed to exist because the claim falls under r. 17.02(g). The motion judge,
    although not performing the analysis described in <i>Van Breda</i>, found that the alleged tort was committed in Ontario. I
    see no basis to interfere with this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The motion judge
    rejected the defendants characterization of the claims as being about the
    governance of a U.S. company in accordance with U.S. law. He stated that, properly
    characterized, the claims were for defamation committed and damages sustained
    in Ontario. On the law of defamation, the motion judge explained at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The case law is clear that the heart of a libel
    action is publication. The tort of defamation is committed where the
    publication takes place. Publication occurs when the words are heard, read or
    downloaded. The statements in question may well have been made in the U.S. by
    the directors or advisors of a U.S. company, but they were published or
    republished in Ontario and they are alleged to have caused injury in Ontario.
    The connection between the subject matter of the actions and Ontario is thus
    significant. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that the statements in question
    were all made in the United States, primarily in New York; although Black
    pleads republication in Ontario, the republication was not made by the
    defendants. They take the position that the alleged tort was not committed in
    Ontario and American libel law would apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that treating the <i>lex loci delicti</i> as the place in which
    allegedly defamatory statements were accessed is inappropriate in the context of
    Internet libel. An approach that looks to where the statements were accessed,
    they argue, is contrary to the principles of order and fairness, leads to libel
    tourism and the prospect of unlimited liability and has a chilling effect on
    freedom of speech.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants advocate a different approach to a claim
    for libel originating on the Internet. They suggest that the focus of the analysis
    of where the tort of Internet libel is committed should be on whether the
    defendant targeted the statements to the forum rather than where they were
    downloaded and read.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of the targeting analysis advocated, the defendants
    cite M. Geist, Is There a There There? Toward Greater Certainty for Internet
    Jurisdiction (2001), 16 Berkeley Tec. L.J. 1345, at 1380 and the case of <i>Young v. New Haven Advocate</i>, 315 F.3d
    256, at 262-63 (4<sup>th</sup> Cir. 2002). In <i>Young</i>, the United States Court of Appeals for the 4<sup>th</sup> Circuit
    concluded that two Connecticut newspapers did not subject themselves to the
    jurisdiction of Virginia courts by posting on the Internet news articles that
    allegedly defamed the warden of a Virginia prison. The court explained at p.
    263: Something more than posting and accessibility is needed to indicate that
    the [newspapers] purposefully (albeit electronically) directed [their] activity
    in a substantial way to the forum state, Virginia. The newspapers must,
    through the Internet postings, manifest intent to target and focus on Virginia
    readers (citations omitted). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants do not point to any Canadian authority
    for such a targeting approach. In <i>Bangoura
    v. Washington Post</i> (2005), 258 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 341 (Ont. C.A.), at
    para. 48, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 497, the
    interveners representing the Media Coalition proposed such an alternative
    approach to the issue of publication on the Internet and jurisdiction; however,
    the court did not find it necessary to determine the issue. Similarly, this
    issue need not be resolved on the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied on this record that there is evidence
    that the defendants did target and direct their statements to this
    jurisdiction. The press releases posted on the Internet specifically provide
    contact information for Canadian media, as well as U.S. and U.K. media. The
    press releases concluded with the heading Contacts for US/Canada Media
    followed by a name and contact information, as well as for UK Media with a
    different name and contact information. The contact information for Canadian
    media clearly anticipated that the statements would be read by a Canadian
    audience and invited Canadian media to respond.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For these
    reasons, I conclude that the motion judge did not err in finding the alleged
    defamation was committed in Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, the defendants submit that in the context of the Internet, downloading was merely the &lsquo;completion&rsquo; of the tort, suggesting that the tort could be committed in more than one jurisdiction. They suggest that where a tort can be committed in more than one jurisdiction, this could create an exception to the presumption of real and substantial connection. However, in my view, it is unnecessary to create a new exception in order to address principles of fairness and order or jurisdictional restraint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a claim in respect of a tort committed in Ontario,
    a connection described in r. 17.02(g), there is a presumption of a connection
    to Ontario for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction. This presumption is
    not conclusive; it remains open to the defendants rebut the presumption and to
    show that in these particular circumstances there is no real and substantial
    connection with Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>2.         Have the defendants rebutted the
    presumption of a real and substantial connection? </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>(i)
    The connection between the plaintiffs claim and the forum</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge held that Black had significant
    connections to Ontario: he lived primarily in Ontario until he was 45 years old;
    he has a home in Ontario; his family resides in Ontario; and he flew to Ontario
    more frequently than any other jurisdiction. Furthermore, the motion judge was
    satisfied that Blacks reputation had been first established in Ontario and that
    he had not received the same level of attention in any other jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that Black is not a resident of
    Ontario, and thus one of the reasons for seeking to facilitate his right to sue
    in Ontario is not present. Furthermore, as a non-Canadian convicted felon, they
    submit that Black does not have the right to enter Canada. They submit that
    there is simply no connection between Blacks claims and Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The assumed jurisdiction test has developed in part to
    protect the legal rights of the forums residents. In<i> Muscutt</i>, at para. 79, the court noted that if the plaintiff lacks
    a significant connection with the forum, the case for assuming jurisdiction on
    the basis of damage sustained within the jurisdiction is weaker. However, it is
    not necessary that the plaintiff be a resident of Ontario. In <i>Van Breda</i>, the Van Breda plaintiffs were
    no longer residents of Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted by the defendants, it is clear from <i>Van Breda</i> that the inquiry is focussed
    on whether there is a connection with the plaintiffs claim and Ontario. As
    such, the focus on the plaintiffs ties to the forum should focus only on ties
    that are relevant to the plaintiffs claim or the subject matter of the suit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that even if the alleged
    defamation was committed in Ontario, republication in Ontario and damage to
    reputation in Ontario are not significant connections in the context of Internet
    libel and in the context of the subject matter of this case. They point out
    that the statements are about Blacks conduct in the United States relating to his
    actions as Chair and CEO of a corporation formed under American law; that the
    impugned statements were press releases and a report through which disclosures required
    under U.S. securities law or under court order were made; and that the subject
    matter of the statements is being investigated and litigated in the United
    States. They say that the focus of the litigation is going to be about the
    truth of the statements, not damages. The truth of the statements will clearly
    involve issues relating to conduct in the U.S., and American corporate and
    securities law will be relevant. Thus, the claims, the defendants submit,
    properly characterized, do not involve a substantial and real connection to
    Ontario. It is their position that the motion judge erred in dismissing this
    characterization of the claims and looking at the wrong factors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the underlying factual context of the
    claims involves significant connections to the United States. The subject-matter
    of the claim and the facts underlying the action are important considerations
    in determining whether there is a real and substantial connection between the
    plaintiffs claim and the jurisdiction. Of course, it may be that there is
    another jurisdiction with an even more substantial connection than Ontario. However,
    this court cautioned in <i>Van Breda</i> that the test for assuming jurisdiction does not turn upon a comparison with
    the strength of the connection with another potentially available jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the damages also clearly arise in
    Ontario. In <i>Van Breda</i>, Sharpe J.A. noted
    that it is clear from the <i>Muscutt</i> quintet that there are many situations where damages sustained in Ontario will
    not serve as a reliable indicator of a real and substantial connection. As
    such, subrule 17.02(h) (damages sustained in Ontario) does not have a presumptive
    effect. However, also in <i>Van Breda</i>, the
    fact that damages were suffered within the jurisdiction was accepted as a
    significant connection and relevant factor: see also <i>Muscutt</i> at para. 81 and <span class=spelle><i>Leufkens</i></span><i> v. Alba Tours International Inc</i>. (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 84 (C.A.), at para.
    24. Thus, while it may not be sufficient to give rise to a presumption, I am
    nonetheless satisfied that damages sustained in Ontario is an added
    connection between Blacks claim and Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the facts relevant to Blacks claim
    relating to publication in Ontario and the damage to Blacks Ontario reputation
    form a significant connection between Blacks claims and Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in all these circumstances, I would not
    interfere with the motion judges finding that there was a real and substantial
    connection between Blacks claim and Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>(ii) The connection between the
    defendants and the forum</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Except for one
    secondary defendant, the defendants have no physical connection to Ontario.
    Further, the defendants conduct in making and posting the statements was
    confined to the United States.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the defendants would have
    been aware of some of Blacks many ties to Ontario or that he had established a
    significant reputation in this jurisdiction. He concluded that they knew, or
    ought to have known, that the statements would be of considerable interest to
    people and media in Ontario and would be published and republished by
    newspapers in Ontario. Thus, although the defendants conduct occurred outside
    the territory, they were connected to Ontario because it was reasonably
    foreseeable to the defendants that the press releases posted to their companys
    New York website would be downloaded and published in Ontario and would result
    in damage to Blacks reputation in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that reasonable forseeability
    itself is not a reliable indication of connection to the jurisdiction. They
    argue that <i>Van Breda</i> makes clear that
    jurisdiction should not be assumed based merely upon the conclusion that the
    defendant ought to reasonably have contemplated being called upon to account
    in the forum (para. 90). Further, they submit that statements placed on the Internet
    are not analogous to defective goods placed in the normal channels of trade. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Van Breda</i> at para. 89<i>, </i>Sharpe J.A. noted that
    physical presence or activity by the defendants within the jurisdiction is not
    always required as set out in <i>Moran v.
    Pyle National (Canada) Ltd.</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 393. Sharpe J.A. cautioned that
    in the situation where the wrongful act and injury both occur outside the
    jurisdiction and the plaintiff returns home, the fact that it was foreseeable
    that the plaintiff would return home and continue to suffer consequential
    damages, is not alone sufficient to make the defendant subject to the
    plaintiffs home jurisdiction under the <i>Moran </i>principle (para. 91).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judges analogy to the approach
    in product liability cases, as found in <i>Moran</i> was appropriate in the circumstances of this case. In <i>Moran</i>, Dickson J. noted at p. 409: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By tendering his products in the market place
    directly or through normal distributive channels, a manufacturer ought to
    assume the burden of defending those products wherever they cause harm as long
    as the forum into which the manufacturer is taken is one that he reasonably
    ought to have had in his contemplation when he so tendered his goods.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted by the motion judge, this approach has been
    mirrored in Internet defamation cases. In <i>Barrick
    Gold Corp. v. Blanchard and Co.</i> (2003), 9 B.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 316 (Ont.
    S.C.), Nordheimer J. stated at para. 44: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a person issues a statement and places that
    statement in a normal distribution channel designed for media attention and
    publication, a person ought to assume the burden of defending those statements,
    wherever they may damage the reputation of the target of those statements and
    thereby cause the target harm, as long as that harm occurred in a place that
    the originator of the statements ought reasonably to have had in  contemplation
    when the statements were issued. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the defendants suggest it is unfair to make
    foreign defendants defend themselves in a jurisdiction to which the statements
    were not directed, in fact, as indicated above, there is clear evidence in this
    case that the press releases were directed to Canadian media. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all these circumstances, I agree with the motion
    judges conclusion that there was a connection between the defendants and the
    forum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>(iii) Fairness in assuming or
    refusing jurisdiction</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As already noted, in <i>Van Breda</i>, it was held that considerations of fairness should serve
    as an analytical tool to assess the relevance, quality and strength of the
    connections that are the core of the test and whether they amount to a real and
    substantial connection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge noted that it is indisputable that the
    law of libel in Ontario is more favourable to plaintiffs than that in the U.S. If
    Black were required to sue for libel in New York or Illinois, he would be
    deprived of the presumptions of falsity, damages and malice. However, he also
    pointed out that loss of juridical advantage does not necessarily result in
    unfairness. The motion judge concluded that it would be unfair to prevent Black
    from bringing the suits in Ontario because Ontario is where his reputation was
    established, where the defamatory statements were published and republished,
    and where the alleged damage occurred. To deny Black the opportunity to
    vindicate his reputation in a jurisdiction that is obviously very important to
    him, the motion judge explained, would be unfair. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In para. 101 of <i>Van
    Breda,</i> this court cautioned that the analysis for jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i> must not anticipate,
    incorporate or replicate consideration of the matters that pertain to the <i>forum non conveniens</i> test. The issue of
    juridical advantage ought not therefore to be considered in this analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, because Blacks claims relate to statements
    published in Ontario and his suits are limited to damages to his reputation in
    Ontario, I agree that it would be unfair to deprive him of a trial before the
    community in which his reputation has been damaged. Members of the community in
    which the reputation is harmed are in the best position to assess damages for
    defamation: see<i> Hill v. Church of
    Scientology of Toronto, </i>[1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at pp. 1196 -1197.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the motion judge concluded that it would not
    be unfair to the defendants to assume jurisdiction. He did not consider that an
    order of a U.S. court requiring the defendants to prepare a report of the Special
    Committee provided immunity from libel actions. While acknowledging that the
    defendants would likely be deprived of the significant juridical advantage they
    would enjoy if the actions proceeded in Illinois or New York, he noted that it
    was reasonably foreseeable that the defendants actions in New York could
    injure Blacks reputation in Ontario, which is where both the tort and the
    damage allegedly occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, there is no unfairness to hold the defendants
    accountable for the accuracy of statements that were widely disseminated over the
    Internet and specifically directed to Canadian media. Some activities by their
    very nature involve a sufficient risk of harm to parties outside the forum in
    which they originate that any unfairness in assuming jurisdiction is mitigated

    86. In <i>Barrick Gold Corp. v. Lopehandia</i>,
    (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 416 (C.A.), at para. 1, Blair J.A. quoted Matthew Collins, <i>The Law of Defamation and the Internet</i> (Oxford University Press, 2001), at para 24.02, that concomitant with the
    powerful possibilities of Internet, the Internet is also potentially a medium
    of virtually limitless international defamation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the motion judge that there is no
    unfairness in requiring the defendants  sophisticated businessmen who targeted
    the Canadian media and who reasonably foresaw the possibility that their
    conduct in posting the statements on the Internet would cause damage to Blacks
    reputation in Ontario  to defend defamation actions brought in Ontario, where
    both the tort and the damages occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all these circumstances, I agree with the motion
    judges conclusion that fairness supports the assumption of jurisdiction. I
    conclude there is a real and substantial connection between the forum and Blacks
    claims and the forum and the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>(iv)
    General principles</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the case is interprovincial or international in nature, comity, and the standards of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement prevailing elsewhere, should be regarded not as independent factors, but as general principles of private international law that bear upon the interpretation and application of the real and substantial connection test. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Van Breda,</i> Sharpe J.A. stated that an important discipline on the assumption of
    jurisdiction, and a check on overreaching, is whether Ontario would be willing
    to recognize and enforce an extra-provincial judgment rendered on the same
    jurisdictional basis as that being asserted.  He also noted that it may be helpful to know how foreign courts treat
    like cases when determining whether to extend the reach of Ontario law against
    a foreign litigant. These considerations promote respect for the principle of
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the courts willingness to
    recognize and enforce an extra-provincial judgment rendered on the same
    jurisdictional basis, favoured Black. The motion judge concluded that the
    circumstances of this case were analogous to the <i>Moran</i> manufacturer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the inter-relationship between the tests for
    assuming jurisdiction and the recognition of foreign judgments, it follows that
    Ontario would be willing to recognize and enforce an extra-provincial judgment
    against an Ontario defendant on the same basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case involves international defendants and activities,
    suggesting caution and restraint. However, I agree with the motion judge that
    even if the Ontario judgment is unenforceable in the United States, a judgment
    would have significant value to Black as a vindication of his Ontario reputation.
    It would also be enforceable against the resident defendant. The unwillingness of
    American courts to enforce a foreign libel judgment that is contrary to the
    actual malice rule, is based upon their constitutional guarantees and as such
    does not raise comity as an issue: see <i>Bangoura </i>at para. 39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that the motion judge erred in
    failing to refer to jurisdictional restraint. Just as unfairness does not
    amount to an independent factor capable of trumping the want of a real and
    substantial connection, I am not persuaded that jurisdictional restraint is a
    free standing principle that could defeat jurisdiction where there is a real
    and substantial connection. The core real and substantial connection test,
    informed by the principle of fairness and the other considerations in <i>Van Breda</i>, results in jurisdictional
    restraint. As explained by the court in <i>Tolofson
    v. Jensen; Lucas (Litigation Guardian of) v. Gagnon, </i>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022,
    at p. 1049, the real and substantial connection test has the effect of preventing
    a court from unduly entering into matters in which the jurisdiction in which it
    is located has little interest: see also <i>Van
    Breda</i> at para. 45. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, the general
    principles support a real and substantial connection of Blacks claims and the defendants
    to the forum and respect the principles of fairness and order, as well as, the
    general principles listed in <i>Van Breda</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I do not agree that the motion judge engage in
    a mechanical tallying of the factors. In para. 80 of his reasons, he was simply
    summarizing his findings. It is clear throughout that he was alive to the need
    to be flexible and focussed upon the connections to the forum and respect for
    the principles of fairness and order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II:<i>        FORUM
    NON CONVENIENS</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decisions on <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> are exercises of judicial discretion. As Laskin J.A.
    explained in <i>Young v. Tyco International
    of Canada Ltd.</i> (2008), 92 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On appeal, the usual principle of deference to
    discretionary decision applies: an appeal court should intervene only if the
    motion judge errs in principle, misapprehends or fails to take account of
    material evidence, or reaches an unreasonable decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not interfere with the motion judges rejection
    of the submission that the action should be stayed on grounds of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants submit that the motion judges decision
    was unreasonable and that, given where the dispute arose, the applicable law,
    and the location of the parties, the witnesses and the evidence, Illinois and
    New York were clearly more appropriate forums.  They also submit that the motion judge misapprehended the relevance of
    the Delaware and Illinois litigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge correctly set out the relevant factors.
    He concluded that Ontario is a convenient and appropriate forum, and that
    neither New York, Illinois, nor any other American jurisdiction, is clearly
    more appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He considered that given the various locations of the
    parties, no single jurisdiction was home to the majority of the parties.
    Although nine of the eleven parties were located in the United States, they
    were spread across six jurisdictions. No matter where the trial was held, most
    parties would have to travel to attend. I am not persuaded that he erred in
    principle in finding this factor to be neutral.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge considered that it would be easier to
    compel interstate evidence under Rule 45 of the U.S. <i>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, and that the location of the key witnesses
    and the bulk of documentary evidence favoured an American jurisdiction. He
    noted, however, that he had no clear evidence of the extent of the additional
    convenience created by Rule 45, and that the importance of the physical
    location of documentary evidence was of less significance with modern
    technology. He was entitled to determine the significance he would give to each
    factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge acknowledged that the main focus at
    trial would most likely be the truth of the statements. He considered that the
    defendants emphasis on the relevance of American securities law and corporate
    law was overstated. He considered that although the factual questions related
    to the truth or falsity of the statements, the applicable libel law would be
    Ontario law. Thus, he was persuaded that this factor favoured Blacks choice of
    forum. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge recognized that there was a risk of
    inconsistent findings relating to some portion of the factual issues. He noted,
    however, that none of the litigation dealt with the issue of damage to Blacks
    reputation in Ontario.  He found that there
    was no risk of inconsistent verdicts given that there were no parallel
    proceedings in the U.S. and because Black had undertaken not to bring any libel
    actions in any other jurisdiction. Even if the motion judge ought to have taken
    a broader view of the potential for inconsistent court decisions, including the
    risk of inconsistent findings relating to the truth of the statements, it is
    clear that there already were a multiplicity of proceedings, in a multiplicity
    of jurisdictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the motion judge considered that the loss of
    juridical advantage, if jurisdiction was declined and Black was required to
    bring his libel actions in the U.S., strongly favoured Black. The parties
    agreed that in the U.S., the Canadian common law presumptions of falsity,
    injury and malice would not be available and, as a public figure, he would be
    required to prove actual malice. This was conceded to be a significant
    juridical disadvantage. The motion judge concluded that, having established a
    real and substantial connection with Ontario, it was perfectly legitimate for
    Black to sue in this jurisdiction and take advantage of its laws. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the motion judge that it is not appropriate
    to label it forum shopping or libel tourism if the party has a real and
    substantial connection with the forum: see <i>Amchem
    Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers Compensation Board)</i>, [1993] 1
    S.C.R. 897, at p. 920. Further, even if the judgment is not enforceable in the
    United States, it is enforceable in Ontario, and there is also value in the
    vindication of a defamation judgment regardless of the ability to collect
    damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the significance of the loss of juridical
    advantage to Black, I am not persuaded that the motion judge erred in the
    exercise of his discretion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that it was unreasonable to conclude
    that neither New York nor Chicago were clearly a more appropriate forum for
    these actions than Ontario. While this certainly was not a clear cut case, it
    was a discretionary decision and I see no error in principle that would justify
    interference.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties have submitted that costs of $35,000 are
    appropriate quantum for the successful party in this case. I agree. I would
    grant costs of $35,000, inclusive of all applicable taxes to the respondent.</p>
