  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An appreciation of the grounds of appeal requires no forced march
    through the evidentiary thicket revealed at trial. Additional detail can await
    discussion of specific grounds of appeal, and will intrude only to the extent
    necessary to their understanding.  </p>
  <h3>The Beginning</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Late in the evening of December 14, 2001, Gangsta Lee<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> went to a party in the Malvern area of Scarborough.  Gangsta Lee is from
    Flemingdon Park, a “Flemmo Park boy”.  At the party, some youths from Regent
    Park, “Park youths”, “rushed” Gangsta Lee. As far as Gangsta Lee was concerned,
    the conduct of these “Regent Park boys” showed disrespect and warranted
    retaliatory measures.</p>
  <h3>The Posse Forms</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gangsta Lee mustered his nephew and both Gavra and Karl Largie to pursue
    his retaliatory objectives.  All of them got into Lee’s car and headed toward
    Regent Park.  </p>
  
  <h3>The Wait</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee drove his car to the vicinity of Dundas and Sumach Streets where he
    parked to await the appearance of some neighbourhood youths.  Lee and his
    recruits did not have to wait long. Within minutes, three or four youths from
    Regent Park came into view. These young men, who included the Ahmed brothers, Mohamoud
    and Ali, were walking along the street after concluding a drug purchase nearby.</p>
  <h3>The Ruse</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At Lee’s suggestion, one of the rear-seat passengers asked the
    pedestrians “what time is it?”.  Despite an answer, the “time asker” repeated
    his question.  Except for Lee, the occupants of the car got out and approached
    the youths on the street.  One of the men, who later became the shooter,
    directed the driver of the car, Lee, to turn the vehicle around.  Lee
    complied.  </p>
  <h3>The Shooting</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the occupants of the vehicle was armed with a metal pipe with
    which he struck Mohamoud Ahmed on the back. Another man from the car stood back
    a short distance, to ensure that none of the targeted group escaped.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the men from the car pulled out a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun
    from the waistband of his pants. This man struck Mohamoud Ahmed on the head
    with the butt of the gun, then fired a single shot from close range at Mohamoud’s
    head.  The bullet struck Mohamoud’s head behind his right ear.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gangsta Lee and his recruits, including the appellants, drove away
    immediately after the shooting.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mohamoud Ahmed died from the gunshot wound.  </p>
  <h3>The Positions of the Parties at Trial</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the prosecutor contended that Gavra Largie was the person who
    shot the deceased to death. Gavra was the front-seat passenger in Lee’s car and
    directed Lee to turn the car around when he (Gavra) got out of the vehicle to
    confront the youths. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor took the position that Karl Largie aided or abetted his
    brother in the intentional killing of the deceased. Karl was a rear-seat
    passenger, either the person who twice asked the time (“the time asker”) or the
    fourth man whose presence intimidated the youths.  Karl was neither the “pipe
    wielder” nor the shooter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Gavra Largie, he was present at, but only a witness to, the
    shooting.  Gangsta Lee was the shooter. The shooting and the blow with the pipe
    that preceded it came as a surprise to Gavra Largie, who had feigned agreement
    with Lee for the singular purpose of getting a ride home.  At Lee’s direction,
    Gavra was the “time asker”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karl Largie also admitted that he was present at the time of the
    shooting, but denied aiding or abetting the shooter. The killing, indeed
    infliction of any bodily harm, was unanticipated.  Karl Largie did not ask the
    time nor wield the pipe; rather, he got out of the car and stood on the street
    away from the others, simply out of curiosity.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal ground of appeal is common to both appellants. Each appellant
    advances additional grounds.  </p>
  <h3>The Common Ground</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An important element of the prosecution’s case at the appellants’ trial
    was evidence of private communications intercepted with the consent of a
    participant, John Doe, and in accordance with an authorization granted under s.
    184.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The appellants say that the statutory
    requirements for an authorization to be given under s. 184.2 are
    constitutionally impotent for failure to require a demonstration of
    investigative necessity as a condition precedent to issuance of an
    authorization. But even if the enabling legislation passes constitutional
    muster, the appellants contend, the authorization in this case was
    improvidently given because the issuing judge did not properly fulfill her role
    as an independent arbiter; rather, she simply rubber-stamped the application.
    In the event of either constitutional fault, the appellants argue that the
    trial judge should have excluded the intercepted private communications as
    evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.</p>
  <h3>The Grounds of Appeal of Gavra Largie</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gavra Largie advances a further ground of appeal in connection with the
    intercepted private communications that were admitted as evidence.  He says
    that the trial judge should have excluded a portion of a conversation that took
    place in his absence between John Doe and Karl Largie. This passage,
    inadmissible against Gavra, portrayed him as a person with homicidal
    tendencies, thus inviting a finding of guilt based on a prohibited chain of
    reasoning that could not be stifled by appropriate limiting instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remaining grounds of appeal advanced by Gavra Largie all have to do
    with the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury. The claims of error
    include submissions that:</p>
  <blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p class="headingNUMBER">i.          the
    trial judge erred in the manner in which he instructed the jury about its
    use of the evidence of Gavra Largie’s extrinsic misconduct; </p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">ii.         the
        trial judge’s final instructions were unbalanced in that more time was
        devoted to a discussion of the position of the prosecutor than  was
        accorded to the position of Gavra Largie and the evidence  supportive
        of it; and</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">iii.       the
        trial judge was wrong in leaving the liability of Gavra Largie to   be
        determined on the basis that he was either the principal or an aider or
        abettor of the principal in the offence charged.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>The Grounds of Appeal of Karl Largie</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karl Largie also complains about the basis upon which the trial judge
    left his liability to the jury.  His complaint has two aspects. The first is
    that the trial judge left his liability as an aider or abettor on the basis
    that Karl Largie was the “time asker” in the absence of any evidence apt to convey
    an air of reality to this basis of accessoryship.  And second, even if there
    were an evidentiary basis for the “time asker” ground of accessoryship, the
    submission of this alternative to the jury occurred so late in the day that it
    caused Karl Largie irreparable prejudice in his defence. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3>The Common Grounds</h3>
  <h3><b>The First
    Ground: The Constitutional Validity of s. 184.2</b></h3>
  <h3><b>The Background</b></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No one recognized any of the gang of four involved in the shooting, or
    the driver of the car.  During the first six weeks of the investigation that
    followed, police received little information from the community.  No solid
    leads.  No suspects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in early February 2002, a man charged with an unrelated robbery
    approached police. He offered to provide police with some information about a
    Regent Park homicide.  The <i>quid pro quo </i>was some assistance on his
    outstanding robbery charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The informant told police that Gavra and Karl Largie approached him in
    mid-January 2002, and told him about the Regent Park shooting.  Gavra Largie told
    the informant that he and Karl were with Garfield Francis (also known as
    Gangsta Lee) and two other persons looking for a man who had disrespected Karl
    Largie at a Malvern area party. The men drove to Regent Park in Gangsta Lee’s
    silver-coloured car.  The group located the person they believed had disrespected
    Karl Largie, and approached him on foot. The man was on a cell phone.  Karl
    Largie froze.  Gavra Largie pulled a gun from his waistband and shot the man.
    As it turned out, the victim was not the person who had disrespected Karl
    Largie, but was part of the group involved in the incident. The assailants fled
    in the car in which they had arrived.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several weeks later, police interviewed the informant in accordance with
    the principles described in <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740. The
    informant, John Doe, agreed to act as a police agent in the investigation that
    followed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 17, 2002, the lead investigator applied to a judge of the
    Ontario Court of Justice for an authorization under s. 184.2 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. Marshall J. granted the authorization in the terms requested. The
    material filed in support of the application included the affidavit of the lead
    investigator and several appendices:</p>
  <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="headingNUMBER">i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the consent of the informant to the interception of the intended private
          communications with the named targets;</p>
        <p class="headingNUMBER">ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Canadian Police Information Centre (“CPIC”) printouts of the
          criminal records and related antecedents of the informant, the appellants, and
          Garfield Francis;</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>                     iii.       the Occurrence Report

    (K.G.) </i>statement of the informant.  </p>
  <h3>The Decision of the Trial Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants challenged the constitutional validity of s. 184.2 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>at trial. Then, as now, the nucleus of their attack was
    and remains the absence of any requirement of investigative necessity as a
    condition precedent of the exercise of the authority to grant an authorization
    for participant surveillance. The inclusion of such a requirement, the
    appellants said then and repeat now, is a constitutional prerequisite. Its
    absence renders s. 184.2 a constitutional fatality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge disagreed.  He concluded that the minimum constitutional
    standard required for Part VI interceptional authority is probable cause.  While
    investigative necessity is a statutory increment for which s. 186(1)(b)
    provides in the case of conventional authorizations, it is not a constitutional
    requirement for any and all forms of electronic surveillance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also concluded that the discretionary nature of the
    authority to grant authorizations under s. 184.2 required the authorizing judge
    to consider all constitutionally recognized values implicated by the circumstances
    of the application.  Among the circumstances to be considered was
    “investigative necessity” as defined in <i>R. v. Araujo</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
    992.  </p>
  <h3>The Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At bottom, the appellants say that, to be constitutionally sound, any
    authority that permits interception of private communications requires proof of
    probable cause and investigative necessity as conditions precedent to the
    issuance of an authorization. The absence from s. 184.2 of any requirement of
    investigative necessity is a fatal constitutional flaw. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants acknowledge that no binding or persuasive authority
    expressly supports their position. A careful review of critical passages in
    several existing authorities, the appellants say, nourishes their claim, at
    least by necessary implication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellants, the constitutionality of Part VI of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> – invasion of privacy – depends upon the inclusion in the Part of
    numerous safeguards against unwarranted state intrusion. Among these safeguards
    is the interposition, between the investigators and the investigated, of a
    neutral third party guardian of constitutional values whose task it is to
    ensure that the right to privacy yields to law enforcement only to the extent
    demonstrably justified.  Whether the investigative method involves third party
    or participant surveillance, the enabling authority can only be justified upon
    a demonstration of probable cause and investigative necessity. The latter is,
    at once, a statutory requirement under s. 186(1)(b) and a constitutional
    prerequisite under s. 8 of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is contrary-minded and submits that investigative
    necessity has not been recognized as a constitutional prerequisite in the
    context of wiretapping, or for that matter in any general or specific search or
    seizure authority. Even if investigative necessity were considered a
    constitutional requirement for third party electronic surveillance, such as wiretapping,
    it does not follow that it occupies a similar place for participant surveillance.
     After all, Mr. McInnes says, participant surveillance is target-specific, more
    akin to a conventional search, and significantly less intrusive than its
    distant cousin, wiretapping.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the respondent, the decision in <i>R. v. Duarte</i>, [1990]
    1 S.C.R. 30, simply required that participant surveillance be authorized by a
    judicial authority in advance of interceptional activity.  The decision said
    nothing about the conditions precedent to be met to obtain that authorization,
    much less that investigative necessity was a <i>sine qua non</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. McInnes reminds us that attempts to draft investigative necessity as
    a constitutional prerequisite into other search contexts, where it is not
    statutorily required, have fallen on barren ground. What will be required, if anything,
    beyond the constitutional minimum of <i>Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc.</i>,
    [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, depends on context, including the nature of the intrusion
    and other circumstances. The focused nature of participant surveillance does
    not require a preliminary demonstration of investigative necessity, even if it
    is viewed as a constitutional requirement for third party surveillance.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 184.2 represents Parliament’s response to <i>Duarte </i>that
    held that the interception of private communications by a state agency with the
    consent of a participant, but without prior judicial authorization, infringed
    s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> and was not saved by s. 1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 184.2 follows the familiar pattern established by ss. 185 and
    186 for conventional authorizations that permit third party surveillance.  The
    procedure, which is <i>ex parte</i>, begins with a written application made by
    a person with statutory status to apply. The application is made to a judge,
    either a provincial court judge or a judge of the superior court of criminal jurisdiction.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The written application must be accompanied by an affidavit of the applicant or
    another peace or public officer compliant with s.&nbsp;184.2(2).  The affidavit
    furnishes the evidentiary predicate upon which the judge must decide whether
    the authorization should be granted. Section 184.2(3) describes the findings
    required as conditions precedent to the exercise of the statutory discretion to
    grant the authorization.  The contents of the authorization must comply with s.
    184.2(4).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some discrepancies exist between the participant and third party
    surveillance schemes. Of importance here is the absence from s. 184.2 of any
    requirement that the affidavit disclose and the judge find investigative
    necessity. Section 184.2 contains no equivalent of either s. 185(1)(h) or s.
    186(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further disparity appears in a comparison of ss. 184.2(3)(c) and
    185(1)(e).  Section 184.2(3)(c) requires that the judge find, based on the
    supportive affidavit,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> that there are “reasonable grounds to believe that <i>information</i> <i>concerning </i>the offence … will be obtained through the interception sought” (emphasis
    added).  Although s. 186 requires no such discrete finding, s. 185(1)(e)
    requires that the affidavit specify “the names, addresses and occupations, if
    known, of all persons, the interception of whose private communications there
    are reasonable grounds to believe may <i>assist</i> the <i>investigation</i> of
    the offence” (emphasis added).  </p>
  <h3>The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interception of private communications by agents of the state with
    the consent of a participant constitutes a search or seizure.  It follows that
    the statutory scheme put in place by s. 184.2 is subject to the requirements of
    s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>: <i>Duarte</i> at pp. 42, 57, and 60; <i>R. v.
    Finlay and Grellette </i>(1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 632 (C.A.), at p. 645. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A statutory provision authorizing electronic surveillance by a state
    agency must conform with the minimum constitutional requirements that s. 8 of
    the <i>Charter</i> demands, a standard described in <i>Hunter</i> as
    “reasonable and probable grounds, established upon oath, to believe that an
    offence has been committed and that there is evidence to be found at the place
    of the search”: <i>Hunter </i>at p. 168; <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
    1421, at pp. 1443-44. The intrusive nature of electronic surveillance,
    especially wiretapping, does not leave open the prospect of any lesser minimum
    requirements: <i>Garofoli</i>, at p. 1444. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provisions of s. 186(1)(a), which require that the authorizing judge
    be satisfied that to grant the authorization would be in the best interests of
    the administration of justice, are identical to the constitutional requirement
    set by <i>Hunter</i>: <i>Duarte</i>, at p. 45; <i>Garofoli</i>, at p. 182.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Finlay and Grellette</i>, the appellants challenged the
    constitutional validity of [then] Part IV.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the
    predecessor to current Part VI. The basis of the challenge was threefold,
    including a submission that the standard for granting a conventional
    authorization, the current s. 186(1), fell below what the Constitution
    requires. The court upheld the validity of the Part examining the full panoply
    of safeguards sprinkled throughout the legislation. Without express reference
    to the investigative necessity requirement of s. 186(1)(b), the court was
    satisfied that the provisions of former s.&nbsp;178.13(1)(a) were
    constitutionally sound.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Duarte</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada considered a challenge to
    the provisions of former s. 178.11(2)(a) that rendered lawful the interception
    of private communications with the consent of a participant, but without any
    requirement of prior judicial authorization. The Court concluded that the
    former s. 178.11(2)(a) did <i>not</i> infringe s. 8, but that the interception
    of private communications by an agency of the state with the consent of a
    participant without prior judicial authorization did infringe the rights and
    freedoms guaranteed by s. 8: <i>Duarte</i>, at p. 60.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For constitutional purposes, the <i>Duarte</i> court equated participant
    surveillance with third party surveillance by state agent: <i>Duarte</i>, at
    pp. 46-47.  It followed that prior authorization by a detached judicial officer
    was required to render constitutional participant surveillance by a state
    agent. What was required to meet the standards imposed by s. 8 was establishing
    to the satisfaction of a detached judicial officer, in advance of interception,
    that an offence has been or was being committed and that interception of
    private communications “stands to afford evidence of the offence”: <i>Duarte</i>,
    at pp. 45-46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Garofoli</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the minimum
    statutory constitutional requirements for judicially authorized third party
    electronic surveillance.  The Court concluded that the statutory requirements
    of former s. 178.13(1)(a), now s.&nbsp;186(1)(a), were identical to the
    constitutional requirements of <i>Hunter</i>: <i>Garofoli</i>, at p.&nbsp;1445.
    The Court added that to obtain an authorization for third party electronic
    surveillance, a state agent must also satisfy the statutory requirements of s.
    178.13(1)(b), now s. 186(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Araujo</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada was required to determine
    whether the facts disclosed in the affidavit filed in support of an application
    for conventional authorization sponsoring third party surveillance met the
    standard required by s.&nbsp;186(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The Court
    re-affirmed the equivalence of s. 186(1)(a) with the minimum constitutional
    standard imposed under <i>Hunter</i>. Nowhere does the Court characterize
    investigative necessity as a constitutional requirement, or as anything other
    than a statutory pre-condition to the exercise of the discretion to grant a
    conventional authorization permitting state-conducted third party surveillance.</p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hunter</i> teaches that the state’s interest in detecting and
    preventing crime begins to prevail over an individual’s interest in being left
    alone at the point at which credibly-based probability replaces suspicion. The
    minimum standard consistent with s. 8 of the <i>Charter </i>for authorizing
    search and seizure is reasonable and probable grounds, established on oath, to
    believe that an offence has been committed and that there is evidence to be
    found at the place of the search: <i>Hunter</i>, at pp. 167-68.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We learn from <i>Duarte</i> that participant surveillance requires
    judicial authorization to meet the constitutional standard of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    The consent of a participant, without more, is constitutionally inadequate when
    the interceptional activity is that of a state agent: <i>Duarte</i>, at p. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 186(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> coincides with the minimum
    constitutional requirement dictated by <i>Hunter</i>. The statutory language
    “it would be in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so
    [to grant the authorization]” is the equivalent of “reasonable and probable
    grounds to believe that an offence has been, or is being, committed and that
    the authorization sought will afford evidence of that offence”: <i>Duarte</i>,
    at p. 45; <i>Garofoli</i>, at p. 1444.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ constitutional challenge founders on several grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from s. 186(1)(b), the appellants can point to no statutory search
    or seizure authority that imposes investigative necessity as a prerequisite to
    issuance of a warrant, authorization or other search authority. And no
    appellate court has held, either expressly or by necessary implication, that
    investigative necessity is a constitutional necessity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In at least two other instances, arguments that advanced a requirement
    of investigative necessity as a constitutional prerequisite to the exercise of
    a statutory power of search or seizure that itself contained no such
    requirement have foundered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. S.A.B.</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 678, the appellants contended
    that the DNA warrant provisions were constitutionally infirm because the
    enabling legislation did not limit their availability to a last resort
    investigative technique. The Court acknowledged that Parliament could have
    included such an investigative necessity provision, but there was no reason to
    require that it do so as a condition of constitutional compliance: <i>S.A.B.</i>,<i> </i>at paras. 53-54; see also, <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. New
    Brunswick (Attorney General)</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 459.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, to require investigative necessity as a constitutional
    imperative in participant surveillance by state agents would essentially
    confine s. 184.2 to investigations of anticipated offences or offences falling
    outside the definition of “offence” in s. 183.  A constitutional requirement of
    investigative necessity, coupled with requirements of s. 184.2(3), would
    essentially duplicate what s. 186(1) requires.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like s. 186(1), the language of s. 184.2(3) is permissive, not
    mandatory. The judge to whom the application for authorization is made is
    vested with a discretion to grant the authorization. The enabling authority
    does <i>not</i> issue as of right. In reaching his or her conclusion, a judge
    under s. 184.2 must consider whether the search proposed is reasonable in light
    of the myriad factors at work in the specific case. In this respect, the
    authorizing judge might have in mind that it is often necessary for
    investigators to accumulate evidence supportive of the account provided by a
    source whose credibility and reliability may be suspect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also worthy of reminder that although it is subject to a
    requirement of prior judicial authorization, participant surveillance differs
    in scope from third-party surveillance. Participant surveillance is generally
    more focused than third-party surveillance, targeting specific conversations
    with specific individuals. Capture of third-party communicants is less likely.
    And the consenting party may also direct the conversations, thus reducing the
    risk of intrusion into the target’s privacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A final point. At least two provincial appellate courts have upheld the
    validity of <i>Criminal Code </i>electronic surveillance provisions that
    contain no reference to investigative necessity, or expressly eliminate
    investigative necessity as a condition precedent.  The relevant provisions
    include s. 184.2(2) (<i>R. v. Bordage </i>(2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 549 (Que.
    C.A.), at paras. 36 and 37) and ss. 185(1.1), 186(1.1) and 186.1 (<i>R. v.
    Doiron</i> (2007), 315 N.B.R. (2d) 205 (C.A.), at paras. 43-46).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal fails. The enabling authority, s. 184.2 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, is constitutional. </p>
  <h3>The Alternative Ground: The Flawed Authorization
    Process</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants advance an alternative argument in the event that s.
    184.2 is constitutionally sound. They say that the authorizing judge gave
    inadequate attention to the application for authorization, thus failing in her
    duty as guardian of the Constitution and granting a search and seizure
    authority that was unreasonable, thus unconstitutional.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>The Background Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial record is largely unrevealing about what occurred on the
    hearing of the application before the authorizing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The affidavit that accompanied the application for authorization was 60
    pages long.  It also included several appendices: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the consent of the informant to interception of anticipated private

        21, 2002.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The affidavit and appendices were 240 pages long.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application and supportive affidavit were in the authorizing judge’s
    hands for about one hour before she issued the authorization. No evidence was
    given about what was said or done on the return of the application when the
    affiant/applicant appeared before the authorizing judge.  </p>
  <h3>The Ruling of the Trial Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ claim at trial alleged a denial of natural justice or,
    at least, a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the authorizing
    judge. The trial judge, despite criticism of the organization, undue factual
    complexity and absence of cross-references in the affidavit, concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, while I am suspicious that the matter may not
    have been considered in a full, fair and impartial manner, the record before me
    does not lead to the conclusion advocated by the defence. Clearly, Marshall J.
    did give one hour’s worth of consideration to the application. In all of these
    circumstances, the defence has not proven a denial of natural justice, a
    reasonable apprehension of bias or a breach of the principles of fundamental
    justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then proceeded to conduct a review of the authorization
    in accordance with the principles expressed in <i>Garofoli </i>and in <i>Araujo</i>. 
    He concluded, on the basis of the information contained in the supportive
    affidavit and appendices, as amplified on the review, that there was reliable
    evidence, that might reasonably be believed, on the basis of which the
    authorizing judge could have been satisfied of the requirements of
    s.&nbsp;184.2(3) and of the investigative necessity requirement in s.
    186(1)(b).  He dismissed the application.</p>
  <h3>The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ complaint is not with the standard of review applied by
    the trial judge in determining whether the authorization was improvidently given.
    The repetition of those principles here would be superfluous. The bite of the
    appellants’ criticism resides in the application of those principles to the
    circumstances of this case. That grievance may be swiftly dispatched.</p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge declined to make the factual findings that were
    essential to the success of this claim of error.  It was open for him to
    conclude as he did.  After all, it was for the appellants to provide the
    evidentiary wherewithal for the factual findings they sought. Their case,
    reduced to its barebones, was that the authorizing judge spent too little time
    reviewing the material to satisfy her constitutional obligations. The record is
    naked of any evidence to rebut the presumption that the authorizing judge
    discharged her statutory and constitutional obligations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further observation is apt. The appellants have not challenged the
    trial judge’s conclusion, in his unerring application of the test on
    authorization review, that the affidavit contained reliable evidence, that
    might reasonably be believed, on the basis of which the authorization could
    have issued.  In the face of such a finding, which sustains the
    constitutionality of the enabling authority, the appellants’ claims lack
    foundation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <h3>The Grounds of Appeal of Gavra Largie</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gavra Largie raises four discrete grounds of appeal against his
    conviction of second degree murder. One relates to the failure of the trial
    judge to redact from recordings made during the participant surveillance a
    passage inadmissible against Gavra and reflective of bad character. The
    remaining grounds have to do with alleged deficiencies in the judge’s final
    instructions to the jury. Each deserves separate consideration.  </p>

  <h3>The First Ground: Failure to Edit
    Participant Surveillance Recordings</h3>
  <h3><b>The Background</b></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 9, 2002, the appellants and John Doe watched a videotape of a
    televised re-enactment of the shooting of the deceased.  The appellants were
    unaware that the information on which the re-enactment was based had been
    provided to police by John Doe. The appellants were equally unaware that police
    had provided Doe with a copy of the video in the hope that a viewing of it with
    the appellants would produce admissions to confirm the details of the shooting
    provided by Doe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gavra Largie became alarmed that the name “G”, a name by which he was
    known, had been mentioned in the police video about the shooting.  He began to
    formulate a plan to flee to Barrie and stay there for a while.  During the
    discussion, John Doe showed Gavra Largie a handgun. Gavra repeatedly asked to
    see and hold the gun. He was convinced that someone had “ratted” him out for
    the shooting, was determined to find out the identity of that person, and
    talked about “merking” the traitor. Gavra Largie proposed use of John Doe’s gun
    to silence the tattle-tale, but Doe declined to provide it: the gun was “too
    hot” according to Doe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The portion of the discussion to which Gavra Largie now takes objection
    occurred after Gavra Largie got out of the car in which the men had been
    talking. Karl Largie and John Doe remained.  The conversation continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>KL:     You were dumb for showing my brother the
    burner yo.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>JD:      I know but.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>KL:     Your fucking dumb!</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>JD:      Now, now he knows ... (talkover)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>KL:     Now all he wants to do is go merk people.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>JD:      Now he knows it’s not a joke.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>KL:     Now he just wants to go merk people!</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>The Pre-Trial Motion to
    Edit</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the trial judge had rejected the appellants’ challenge to the
    constitutionality of the participant surveillance, counsel were given the
    opportunity to make submissions about editing the recording to redact from the
    recording and its transcript any passages that were more prejudicial than probative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor and counsel for Karl Largie wanted the passage excerpted
    in paragraph 81 to be left for the jury to consider with appropriate limiting
    instructions. The prosecutor argued that the evidence was properly admissible
    against Karl Largie, the speaker, to rebut his claim of innocent presence at
    the scene of the shooting and lack of foresight of Gavra’s use of the gun.
    Trial counsel for Karl Largie also resisted editing of this passage, because it
    supported his defence of unforeseen use of the weapon by his brother. Counsel for
    Gavra Largie objected.  In his submission, the evidence, which was not
    admissible against Gavra, was gravely prejudicial and the prejudice could not
    be eliminated or minimized by apt mid-trial and final instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his compendious ruling on the admissibility of evidence obtained by
    participant surveillance, the trial judge did not mention or make any finding
    in connection with this conversation, but invited counsel to request further
    explanation if any were required.  Trial counsel for Gavra Largie did not renew
    his request nor reiterate any objection when the evidence was adduced before
    the jury.</p>
  <h3>The Subsequent Discussions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing more was said about the excerpted passage until the pre-charge
    conference. Counsel for Gavra Largie at trial, apparently under the impression
    that the trial judge had in fact ruled the passage admissible, sought a
    limiting instruction.  Counsel wanted the jury instructed that the evidence was
    inadmissible against Gavra Largie, but, despite its inadmissibility, it could
    induce the forbidden chain of reasoning from propensity to guilt and, in any
    event, could not support the retrospectant inference that Karl Largie sought to
    have drawn from it regarding his mental state eight months earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge invited counsel for Gavra Largie to suggest a “more benign
    phraseology” than the trial judge had proposed to include in his final
    instructions.  Counsel (not Mr. Snell) declined to assist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Karl Largie and the prosecutor offered different
    interpretations of the evidentiary value of Karl Largie’s remarks in
    determining his state of mind at the time of the shooting eight months earlier.
    Neither invited the jury to engage in propensity reasoning or to use Karl’s
    utterances in any way in determining the case against Gavra.  </p>
  <h3>The Jury Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> During the trial and in final instructions the trial judge repeatedly
    instructed the jury about evidence of limited admissibility – that evidence was
    admissible in connection with the case for and against one accused, but not the
    other, or for one purpose but not another.  Jurors were told of:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">i.          the
        impermissible use of evidence of bad character;</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">ii.         the
        impermissible use of incriminating statements made by one  accused in
        the absence of the other; and</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">iii.       the
        need to consider the case in relation to each accused separately.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to repeated general instructions about evidence of limited
    admissibility, the trial judge made specific reference to the evidence of which
    Gavra Largie complains.  Typical of his instructions on this issue is the
    following passage:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These remarks by Karl Largie, as I have just
    excerpted them, in the absence of Gavra Largie, <i>are only admissible against
    Karl Largie to prove that Karl Largie knew in August 2002 of Gavra Largie’s
    willingness to use a gun in August 2002, </i>once Gavra Largie had possession
    of it.  If you interpret these remarks of Karl Largie as advocated by the Crown
    Attorney, you <i>may</i> use that knowledge of Karl Largie in August 2002 in
    deciding whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt <i>that Karl
    Largie intentionally and knowingly and purposely assisted Gavra Largie </i>in
    killing Mohamoud Ahmed on December 15, 2001...  If you do not interpret these
    remarks of Karl Largie as advocated by the Crown Attorney, or if you are not
    satisfied that Karl Largie knew Gavra Largie had a gun on December 15, 2001,
    disregard these remarks in the rest of your deliberations about the guilt or
    innocence of Karl Largie.  <i>Moreover, these remarks</i> <i>of Karl Largie are
    not admissible against Gavra Largie, <u>however you interpret them</u></i>.  <i>You
    may not use them in determining the guilt or innocence of Gavra Largie.</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided counsel with copies of his proposed final
    instructions in advance of their delivery.  After the charge had been
    completed, counsel for Gavra Largie acknowledged that the instructions had made
    it clear that Karl Largie’s statements were only admissible against Karl
    Largie.  In the end, counsel complained that the repetition of the admittedly
    proper limiting instructions undermined the fairness of Gavra Largie’s trial
    and warranted a mistrial.  The trial judge dismissed the mistrial application.  </p>
  <h3>The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal has to do with the reception into evidence of part
    of a discussion among the appellants and John Doe after they had viewed a
    police re-enactment video of the shooting of the deceased. The speakers in the
    passage to which objection is taken are Karl Largie and John Doe. Gavra Largie,
    whose conduct is the subject of comment, was absent. It is common ground that
    the trier of fact could <i>not</i> consider this evidence in determining
    whether the prosecution had proven Gavra Largie’s guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The receivability of this evidence requires recourse to basic principles
    of relevance, materiality and admissibility. Relevance and materiality relate
    to the potential or tendency of this evidence to prove what it is offered to
    prove, and the relationship between what it is offered to prove and the issues in
    the case. Admissibility has to do with the ability of the evidence to comply
    with the rules that regulate the reception of evidence that is relevant and
    material.  The rules of admissibility are rooted in the soil of policy.  No
    single organizing or justificatory principle underlies every rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a commonplace of criminal trials that an item of evidence may be
    admissible for one purpose, but not for another. This principle of limited
    admissibility applies equally to the trial of individual and several accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a joint trial, a statement made by one of several accused, <i>not</i> in furtherance of any common design and <i>not</i> adopted by any other
    accused, is admissible only in relation to its maker, even if it mentions
    something said or done by another accused: <i>R. v. Suzack</i> (2000), 141
    C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 117. In some instances, what is said by
    the maker about a co-accused may be so prejudicial to that co-accused so as to
    require a separate trial for the accused against whom the statement is not
    admissible: <i>R. v. Guimond</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 960, at p. 981; <i>R. v. C.
    (B.) </i>(1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 608 (C.A.), at p. 614, leave to appeal refused,
    [1993] 3 S.C.R. viii.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An admissibility rule frequently in play in cases involving evidence of
    limited admissibility applies a cost benefit analysis to evidence that is
    otherwise relevant, material and compliant with the rules of admissibility.
    Under this rule, a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on the
    basis that its prejudicial effect exceeds its probative value: <i>R. v. Mohan</i>,
    [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 at p. 21.  A trial judge may also exclude otherwise relevant,
    material and admissible evidence in order to prevent an unfair trial: <i>R. v.
    Buric</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 535, aff’g (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discretion to exclude relevant, material and otherwise admissible
    evidence may take on a somewhat different dimension in a joint trial. Evidence
    received as an admission by one accused, and admissible in relation to him or
    her, may contain prejudicial information about another accused in connection
    with whom the evidence is inadmissible. The probative value of the evidence
    relates to the party making the admission. But the prejudicial effect of the
    evidence has to do with an accused against whom the evidence is not admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each accused who participates in a joint trial is entitled to the
    constitutional protections inherent in the right to a fair trial. Among those
    protections is the right to be shielded from evidence that unfairly prejudices
    that accused: <i>Suzack</i>, at para. 111. But joint trials are different than
    trials involving a single accused. And the right of every accused to a fair
    trial does not mean that those tried jointly are entitled to an exact copy of
    the trial they would receive if they were to be tried alone: <i>Suzack</i>, at
    para. 111.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To balance the competing interests of co-accused in a joint trial, the
    authorities conclude that a carefully crafted jury instruction about the
    permitted and prohibited use of evidence of limited admissibility is the best
    way to achieve that balance: <i>Suzack</i> at para. 114.  Absent alteration of
    the paradigm of trial by jury, constitutionally guaranteed in cases such as
    this, we proceed on the basis that juries accept and follow judicial
    instructions: <i>Suzack</i>, at para. 128; <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1
    S.C.R. 670, at pp. 692-93.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A determination of where the balance falls as between probative value
    and prejudicial effect involves the exercise of judicial discretion. These
    assessments are notoriously fact-specific and entitled to substantial
    deference, absent any errors in principle: <i>R. v. Higginbottom</i> (2001),
    156 C.C.C. (3d) 178 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 9.</p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine whether this complaint should prevail, it is helpful to
    return to the context in which the words were spoken and the reliance the
    parties placed upon the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case for the prosecution was that Gavra Largie was the shooter, a
    fact established chiefly by Gavra Largie’s admissions recorded during
    participant surveillance and overheard after arrest in jail cell conversations.
    The prosecutor’s position was that the admissions were truthful and
    demonstrated Gavra Largie’s participation in the killing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gavra Largie had his own explanation for these admissions. What he said
    was not true; instead, his statements were a pack of lies uttered to puff up
    his reputation and persuade Gangsta Lee to let him back into the lucrative drug
    trade. According to Gavra Largie, he was present at the shooting. He saw it
    happen.  But Gangsta Lee was the shooter.  The shooting took Gavra Largie by
    surprise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karl Largie, who the prosecutor alleged was an aider or abettor, also
    admitted being present at the time of the shooting. However, he too was taken
    by surprise and did not aid or abet anyone shooting the deceased.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel for Karl Largie sought the admission of this evidence at
    trial. He explained that Karl Largie’s state of mind at the time of the
    shooting was critical to a determination of his potential liability as an aider
    or abettor. This evidence tended to show that Gavra Largie was a loose cannon,
    who tended to act precipitously and unpredictably.  Thus, what happened could
    not have been within the reasonable contemplation of his brother, Karl.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor also relied on this evidence as relevant to a material
    issue at trial: Karl Largie’s state of mind contemporaneous with the shooting.
    The evidence provided a context for the assessment of Karl’s own inculpatory
    statements on August 9, 2002, and could support an inference of knowledge about
    Gavra’s use of weapons, thus diminishing his (Karl’s) claim of surprise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admission of Karl Largie was admissible in relation to its maker. It
    was relevant to a material issue at trial, Karl Largie’s state of mind at the
    time of the shooting.  It was not admissible in connection with Gavra Largie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge could only have excluded this evidence if he were
    satisfied that its prejudicial effect in connection with Gavra Largie
    outweighed its probative value in relation to Karl Largie.  In assessing
    potential prejudice against Gavra Largie, it is critical to bear in mind that
    the jury received mid-trial and repeated final instructions about the permitted
    and prohibited uses of evidence of extrinsic misconduct or general bad
    character, and evidence of statements made by or attributed to individual accused.
    The jurors were told of their obligation to consider the case for and against
    each accused separately, and apparently did so according to their verdicts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The failure to edit Karl Largie’s comments from the participant
    surveillance recordings reflects no error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal fails.</p>
 
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>The Second Ground: Instructions on Prior
    Discreditable Conduct</h3>
  <h3>The Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    record is littered with evidence of discreditable conduct and an anti-social
    lifestyle on the part of both appellants, especially Gavra Largie. That said,
    much of the evidence was introduced by counsel for the appellants at trial.
    Karl Largie sought to make use of his brother’s unpredictable and aggressive
    tendencies to buttress his (Karl Largie’s) denial of complicity.  In some
    measure, at least, he succeeded.  </p>
  <h3>The Alleged Error</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The error
    alleged here has to do with the manner in which the trial judge <i>described</i> the evidence of disreputable conduct that was subject to his instructions about
    permitted and prohibited use. Counsel for Gavra Largie sought an instruction
    that did not particularize the items of evidence that were subject to the
    limitations on use.  A more general instruction that defined the permitted and
    prohibited uses, shorn of specifics, was what he sought. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge listed several themes that were the subject of evidence of disreputable
    conduct: </p>
  <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant Karl Largie at trial supported the trial judge’s
    determination to describe by theme the evidence of discreditable conduct that
    was subject to the instruction about limited admissibility.</p>
  <h3> The Jury Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent
    with his several mid-trial instructions on evidence of limited admissibility,
    the trial judge explained to the jury the use it could make of the evidence of
    disreputable conduct (narrative in context) and the use it was not permitted to
    make of the same evidence.  He repeatedly warned the jury, in language about
    which no exception has been or could be taken, that they were <i>not</i> to use
    this evidence:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">i.          as
        proof that Gavra Largie was a person of bad character, thus of a   disposition
        to commit the offence charged; or</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">ii.         as
        a person deserving of punishment for his prior misconduct by being
        convicted of the offence charged.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    evidence of extrinsic misconduct by an accused is admitted in a criminal case,
    the trial judge is required, in most cases at least,<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> to provide limiting instructions to the jury.  These instructions are to ensure
    that the jury understand what use they may make of the evidence in deciding the
    case, as well, if not more importantly, what use the law forbids them to make of
    it in coming to their conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the usual
    course, instructions about jury use of evidence about limited admissibility,
    whether given mid-trial or as final instructions, should do three things:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER"><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>identify</i> the <i>evidence</i> to which they relate</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER"><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>explain the <i>permitted </i>use of the evidence</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER"><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>explain the <i>prohibited</i> use of the evidence</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>R. v. Crawford</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 858, at pp.
    883-85; <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 184; <i>Corbett</i>,
    at p. 695.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    composition of these limiting instructions, substance governs, not form. No
    case holds that a specific word formula or pattern must be followed to identify
    the items of evidence to which the instructions about limited admissibility
    apply.</p>
  
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would
    not accede to this claim of error for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First of
    all, as a matter of general principle, the manner in which a limiting
    instruction is composed rests largely within the discretion of the trial judge.
    Substance counts, not form.  The tail does not wag the dog.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    what is of crucial importance in a limiting instruction is its substance, the very
    core of the direction that explains to jurors the use they <i>can</i> make of
    the evidence, and the use that the law forbids them from making of the evidence
    in reaching their verdict. Gavra Largie raises no complaint about the substance
    of the instruction on evidence of disreputable conduct. The jury was properly
    instructed about the permitted, as well as the prohibited use of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    trial counsel for Gavra Largie was offered the opportunity to assist in the
    composition of a more suitable description of the evidence to which the
    limiting instruction was to apply. Despite his disapproval of the trial judge’s
    proposed approach and language, trial counsel declined to offer any alternative
    formula.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We expect
    counsel conducting a case, whether prosecuting or defending, to assist the
    trial judge by offering constructive submissions about the content of jury
    instructions, especially but not only final instructions. Failure to assist, by
    failure to respond to an express invitation, may be indicative of the
    seriousness of what is later said to be error and a factor in appellate review: <i>R. v. Royz</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 423, at para. 3; <i>R. v. Daley</i>, [2007]
    3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 58; <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para.
    38; <i>R. v. Cudjoe</i> (2009), 68 C.R. (6th) 86 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 155.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    finally, this was a joint trial.  In formulating what he would say and how he
    would say it regarding the evidence of disreputable conduct, the trial judge
    was <i>not</i> confined to a consideration of the interest of Gavra Largie.
    Karl Largie and the prosecutor relied on this evidence. Both were content with
    the approach suggested by the trial judge in pre-charge discussions and
    followed in his final instructions. The jury were entitled to know the evidence
    to which the limiting instructions applied. The manner and description chosen
    fulfilled that obligation in a fair and balanced way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>The Third Ground: The Unbalanced Charge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gavra
    Largie also contends that the trial judge’s charge was unfair and unbalanced.
    Reduced to its essentials, the complaint is that the trial judge devoted excessive
    time to his description of the position of the prosecutor and insufficient time
    to the position of Gavra Largie. Three times as many pages were lavished on the
    position of the prosecutor. Further, Gavra Largie says, the trial judge failed
    to remind the jurors of certain features of the defence case to which counsel
    had referred in his closing address.</p>
  
  <h3>The Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his
    final instructions, the trial judge explained to the jury what the prosecutor
    had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to establish Gavra Largie’s guilt, first
    as the shooter, then as an aider or abettor of Gangsta Lee as the shooter. The
    trial judge had earlier defined murder and told the jurors about the essential
    elements of accessoryship by aiding or abetting. The trial judge followed the
    same pattern for Karl Largie and related the principle of reasonable doubt to
    evidence adduced by the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge returned to the first issue the jurors were required to decide in
    relation to Gavra Largie.  He framed this issue as a question:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Was Gavra
    Largie the shooter?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then
    reviewed the position of the prosecutor on this issue, including a summary of
    portions of the participant surveillance recording of August 9, 2002, and
    various items of evidence of post-offence conduct.  This review covered 22
    pages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge turned to the position of Gavra Largie. It was Gavra Largie’s position
    that he was an unwitting witness to an unexpected shooting by Gangsta Lee.  His
    later statements admitting involvement were a pack of lies, offered to impress
    Gangsta Lee who he hoped would consider him (Gavra Largie) a worthy ally in the
    drug trafficking business. The trial judge reviewed those portions of the
    evidence on which Gavra Largie relied and moved on to the remaining issues
    before turning to Gavra Largie’s liability as an aider or abettor.  The review
    covered 11 pages.  </p>
  <h3>The Objections        </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel for Gavra Largie objected to this imbalance in the trial judge’s
    instructions. In particular, counsel pointed out that the trial judge had
    failed to refer to the defence position on each item of evidence relied upon by
    the prosecutor and had spent more time and pages (22 versus 11) on the
    prosecutor’s position than on the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the
    course of his objections, counsel for the appellant at trial observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think what I am ultimately saying is this, and I
    don’t disagree, I think your Honour really captured the essence of the
    defence.  I think you explained it in simple terms.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3> The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    determination of this ground of appeal rests on an application of basic
    principle to the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Except in
    rare cases where it would be needless to do so, a trial judge is obliged to
    advise the jury of the defence position, to review the substantial features of
    the evidence and to relate that evidence to the critical issues in the case so
    that the jurors will appreciate the value and effect of that evidence: <i>Azoulay
    v. The Queen</i>, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, at pp. 497-98; <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 378 (C.A.), at p. 385; <i>Daley</i>, at para. 54; <i>Cudjoe</i>,
    at para. 150.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial
    judge is under no obligation to review in final instructions <i>all</i> the
    evidence upon which an accused relies in support of his or her position: <i>Azoulay</i>,
    at p. 498; <i>Daley</i>, at para. 55; <i>Cudjoe</i>, at para. 151. The role of
    the trial judge is to decant and to simplify: <i>Jacquard</i>, at para. 13. The
    extent to which a trial judge must review the evidence is a variable, not a
    constant. It depends on the circumstances of each case. It can nearly always be
    said that a trial judge could have reviewed the evidence in greater detail. But
    that is not the test.  The standard is adequacy, not perfection.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    courts take a functional approach to claims of inadequacy in jury instructions.
    We test the instructions against their ability to fulfill their intended
    purposes, not by reference to their page count or their adherence to or
    departure from some pre-determined formula or pattern: <i>Jacquard</i>,<i> </i>at
    para. 14; <i>MacKinnon</i>,<i> </i>at pp. 385-386; <i>R. v. Cooper</i>, [1993]
    1 S.C.R. 146, at pp. 163-4; <i>R. v. John</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 781, at pp. 792-3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury
    charge must also be even-handed, the instructions fair and balanced.  No sides
    should be taken and no editorial comment should intrude: <i>R. v. Baltovich</i> (2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at paras. 117-118.</p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    predominant issue for the jurors to decide in connection with Gavra Largie was
    whether the prosecutor had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Gavra Largie
    was the shooter. Nobody identified Gavra Largie as the shooter. In fact, Gavra
    Largie relied upon this lack of identification and the inconsistency of his
    appearance with the various descriptions provided by the eyewitnesses as
    consistent with his claim of mere presence.  The trial judge adequately
    apprised the jury of this position.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    argument that the charge was unfair and unbalanced lacks traction.  I say so
    for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    adequacy of jury instructions to explain the position of the defence, review
    the supportive evidence and relate that evidence to the position, so that the
    jury understands its value and effect, is not measured by a simple comparison
    of the minutes, number of pages or lines of transcript devoted to the defence
    as compared to the prosecution. Jury charges are not political broadcasts that
    require equal time for all participants. It seems almost inevitable, an
    incident of or inherent in the assignment of the burden of proof, that the
    position of the prosecutor may well occupy more space than that of the defence,
    especially in cases where an accused denies participation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this
    case, the prosecutorial page count is swollen by evidentiary references, a
    summary of the same evidence upon which Gavra Largie relied to support a
    contrary finding of fact. The trial judge was not obliged to repeat the same
    evidence, only to ensure the jury’s understanding of how it could produce a
    contrary factual conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    trial counsel for Gavra Largie acknowledged that the trial judge “really
    captured the essence of the defence” and had “explained it in simple terms”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge was under no obligation to refer to every evidentiary tid-bit
    or to repeat every argument advanced by counsel at trial. Anything omitted did
    not deprive Gavra Largie of a fair adjudication of his defence. These
    instructions were fair and balanced, and even-handed in their treatment of a
    defence that might fairly be categorized as implausible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <h3>The Fourth Ground: The Alternative Basis of
    Liability</h3>
  <h3><b>The Background</b></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gavra
    Largie advances a further argument that was not made at trial. The submission
    is that the trial judge was wrong in leaving Gavra Largie’s liability to the
    jury on the basis that he aided or abetted Gangsta Lee who shot the deceased to
    death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal evidentiary foundation for this alternative basis of liability was
    Gavra Largie’s own testimony that it was Gangsta Lee and not he who shot the
    deceased.  The similarities between Gangsta Lee and the descriptions provided
    by some eyewitnesses of the shooter could also support such a conclusion, and
    some of the intercepted private communications could be viewed as revealing a joint
    venture to kill or harm a <span lang=EN-US>“</span>Regent Park boy” to avenge
    the prior disrespect of Gangsta Lee.</p>
  <h3>The Positions At Trial</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecutor’s position at trial was that Gavra Largie was the shooter and that
    his crime was second degree murder.  Manslaughter was not an available
    verdict.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel for Gavra Largie took the position that Gavra Largie was not the
    shooter. Gangsta Lee was the killer. Gavra Largie was present, an innocent
    bystander whose main interest was getting a ride home. Gavra Largie’s counsel
    conceded, however, that he could not “fend off” an alternative basis of
    liability, namely that Gavra Largie was an aider or abettor, “with any degree
    of cogency”.  </p>
  <h3>The Jury Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge left Gavra Largie’s liability as an aider or abettor of Gangsta Lee as a
    secondary basis upon which jurors could find Gavra Largie guilty of murder or
    manslaughter. The primary basis upon which Gavra Largie’s liability was left to
    the jury was that he was the shooter. The trial judge opened his discussion of
    Gavra Largie’s liability as an aider or abettor in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fourth issue to be determined in the case
    against Gavra Largie relates to the possibility that some, or all, of you may
    not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Gavra Largie was the shooter. 
    For ease of reference, it is helpful to repeat the issue now.  The fourth issue
    is:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Assuming you are not satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that Gavra Largie was the shooter, has the Crown proven beyond
    a reasonable doubt that Gavra Largie intentionally assisted, or encouraged,
    Gangsta Lee, for the purpose of intentionally killing Mohamoud Ahmed?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge explained the position of the prosecutor and Gavra Largie in connection
    with this basis of criminal liability both for murder and manslaughter. 
    Neither objected to the substance of any instructions on aiding or abetting.</p>
  <h3>The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a
    matter of general principle, the submission of an alternative basis of
    liability is controlled by the air of reality standard. Whether in the trial of
    a single accused or in a joint trial, the submission of aiding or abetting to
    the jury as a basis of liability is conditioned upon the trial record
    containing some evidence upon the basis of which a properly instructed jury,
    acting reasonably, could convict an accused as an aider or abettor, if they
    believed the evidence to be true: see <i>R. v. Cinous</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3,
    at para. 51. An essential component of this evidentiary foundation is evidence
    that more than one person was involved in the commission of the offence: <i>R.
    v. Isaac</i>, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 74, at pp. 80-81; <i>R. v. Sparrow </i>(1979), 51
    C.C.C. (2d) 443 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 458.</p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence given at trial disclosed the involvement of several people in the
    attack on the deceased and his companions. A driver. A “time asker”. A “pipe
    wielder”. A shooter. And another whose presence ensured that the quarry would
    not easily escape.  The group was assembled to exact revenge on a “Regent Park
    boy”, any “Regent Park boy”, it would appear, for disrespect shown earlier to
    Gangsta Lee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    admissions of Gavra Largie implicated him as the shooter. The testimony of
    Gavra Largie, on the other hand, assigned responsibility for the shooting to
    Gangsta Lee.  The evidence of a joint venture, fuelled by a desire for revenge,
    was substantial. Trial counsel for Gavra Largie acknowledged that there was an
    evidentiary basis upon which Gavra Largie could be found guilty as an aider or
    abettor of the shooter, Gangsta Lee.  He was right in this acknowledgement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would
    reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>The Grounds of Appeal of Karl
    Largie</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karl
    Largie raises a ground of appeal that has to do with the manner in which the
    trial judge instructed the jury on his liability as an aider or abettor of the
    shooter in the unlawful killing of the deceased.  He submits that the trial
    judge was wrong to leave the alternative, conjured during the penultimate
    stages of the trial by the trial judge and eagerly embraced by the prosecutor, that
    had not been in play as the evidence was elicited. The introduction of this
    alternative, Mr. Lacy urges, was at once unfair and gravely prejudicial to Karl
    Largie.  </p>
  <h3>The Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case
    for the prosecution was that the killing of the deceased was the result of a
    joint venture of the several occupants of Gangsta Lee’s car to seek revenge for
    the disrespect shown to Gangsta Lee by a “Regent Park boy” earlier.  Each of
    the occupants of the vehicle had a role.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecutor contended that Karl Largie was a rear-seat passenger in Gangsta
    Lee’s car.  He was one of the men who got out of the vehicle shortly before the
    shooting.  It was no part of the prosecutor’s case that Karl Largie was the
    shooter, the “pipe wielder” or the driver of the car.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karl
    Largie never denied that he was present when the deceased was shot to death. 
    No evidence implicated him as the shooter.  Thus, his liability fell to be
    assessed by the application of ss. 21(1)(b) and 21(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> to the facts as the jury found them to be. Aiding or abetting contains
    both conduct and fault requirements. It was the prosecutor’s obligation to
    prove that Karl Largie said or did something that helped or encouraged the
    shooter to commit the offence and that he provided the help or offered the
    encouragement with the intention of helping or encouraging the shooter to
    commit the offence: <i>R. v. Almarales </i>(2008), 237 C.C.C. (3d) 148 (Ont.
    C.A.).</p>
  <h3>The Positions at Trial</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    assessment of the merits of this ground of appeal will be informed by a brief
    recapture of the positions advanced by the various parties at different times
    during the trial proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her
    opening to the jury, the prosecutor assigned Karl Largie a place in the rear
    seat of Gangsta Lee’s motor vehicle, later a spot on the sidewalk after all the
    passengers got out of the car.  She did not then identify the precise role that
    Karl Largie played. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karl
    Largie sought a directed verdict of acquittal at the end of the prosecutor’s
    case.  His counsel described Karl Largie’s role as that of the fourth man, a
    person who was nearby the shooting, but who did not participate in it or in its
    immediate precursor, the striking of the deceased with a pipe.  When asked by
    the trial judge about a passage in the intercepted conversations when Karl
    Largie said “it was dirt that made me holler at him”, counsel responded that it
    was impossible to tell what the passage meant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her
    submissions in opposition to the motion for a directed verdict, the prosecutor
    responded that Karl Largie could have been any one of the rear seat passengers,
    including the “time asker” – an inference that could be drawn from the comment
    “it was dirt that made me holler at him”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his
    closing address, counsel for Karl Largie told the jury that he anticipated that
    the prosecutor would submit that Karl Largie was the “time asker”. He decried
    the strength of the inference the prosecutor sought to draw from the
    intercepted comment and characterized reliance on that basis of liability as
    indicative of a weak prosecution case and a desperate prosecutor. He designated
    the prosecutor’s position as a late day “plan B” devoid of any legitimacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecutorial response was that the evidence could support Karl Largie’s
    liability as either the “fourth man” or as the “time asker”.  But the
    prosecutor pointed out that she was <i>not</i> pressing the “time asker”
    position, because in effect, she was confident that Karl Largie’s guilt was
    established irrespective of the particular rule assigned to him.</p>
  <h3>The Charge to the Jury</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge submitted two questions to the jurors in connection with Karl Largie’s
    liability. One question dealt with Karl Largie’s liability for second degree
    murder, the other with his liability for manslaughter.  Neither identified a specific
    role in the relevant events for Karl Largie.  In his discussion of the position
    of the prosecutor, the trial judge referred to Karl Largie as performing either
    of two roles: the “time asker” or the “fourth man” who intimidated by presence,
    but did nothing further. Later, the trial judge described the prosecutor’s
    principal submission as the person who intimidated by presence, but otherwise
    did nothing. The evidentiary references the trial judge included in his
    discussion of the positions of the parties were all directed at Karl Largie’s
    position as the “fourth man”.</p>
  <h3>The Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles that govern the authority of a trial judge to leave an alternative
    basis of liability to the jury have been discussed already.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing this ground of appeal, it is helpful to bear in mind the effect we
    assign to the opening address of the prosecutor and the relationship between
    the position advanced by the prosecutor and the basis upon which jurors
    determine whether the guilt of an accused has been proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    opening address of the prosecutor does not amount to provision of particulars
    that the prosecutor is bound to prove or fail in his or her case: <i>R. v.
    Govedarov </i>(1974), 3 O.R. (2d) 23 (C.A.), at pp. 55-56; <i>R. v. Bengert et
    al. (No. 5) </i>(1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 542.  A
    prosecutor’s theory of the case is <i>not </i>the same as a particularized
    indictment.  It is the indictment and only the indictment that defines the
    factual transaction that the prosecution must prove in order to obtain a
    conviction: <i>R. v. McCune </i>(1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 152 (B.C. C.A.), at para.
    37.  The prosecutor is bound to prove formal particulars, subject to the
    surplusage rule, but not particulars of the theory or position advanced to
    establish liability: <i>R. v. Groot</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 280 (C.A.), at p.
    286.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A related
    point concerns what it is that the prosecutor is required to prove in order to
    establish guilt. The prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the
    essential elements of the offence.  Nothing more is required.  Nothing less is
    sufficient.  The trier of fact makes this determination based on its factual
    findings from the evidence adduced at trial.  Findings of guilt are rooted in
    evidence, not in theory.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching their verdict, jurors need not be unanimous about their acceptance of
    individual items of evidence, the weight they assign to them, or the specific
    nature of an accused’s participation in an offence: <i>R. v. Thatcher</i>,
    [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at p. 694.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A final
    point. Trial fairness considerations may intervene and foreclose consideration
    of alternative base of liability inconsistent with the way the parties have
    conducted their respective cases: <i>R. v. Ranger </i>(2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 1
    (C.A.), at para. 162.</p>
  <h3>The Principles applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    Mr. Lacy’s carefully developed submissions, I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the
    outset of trial proceedings, it was clear that the prosecutor’s case against
    Karl Largie rested on aiding or abetting. Karl Largie was a rear-seat passenger
    who, together with other rear-seat passengers and the shooter, got out of the
    vehicle and surrounded the victim. The front seat passenger was the shooter.
    Everyone arrived together. Everyone knew of their mission: to avenge the
    disrespect shown to Gangsta Lee. The backseat passengers included the “time
    asker”, the “pipe wielder” and the “fourth man”. The “time asker” spoke. The
    others said nothing. The liability of Karl Largie depended on the inferences
    the trier of fact would draw from what he did or didn’t do, said or didn’t say.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecutor’s reliance on aiding or abetting to establish Karl Largie’s
    liability was a constant throughout the trial. In the absence of firm and
    consistent evidence of identification, it is understandable that the prosecutor
    would not rest her case exclusively on one role.  She was entitled to do so
    because the evidence left open both.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inherent
    in Karl Largie’s complaint, at least as it seems to me, is a flawed perception
    of the role of the prosecutor’s “theory” in proof of guilt. A “theory” is <i>not</i> a particular the prosecutor is bound to establish, or fail in its proof. The
    prosecutor was required to prove the essential elements of the offence, a
    determination that was for the jury to make, based upon their application of
    governing legal principles to the facts as they found them.  The evidence must
    prove guilt, not vindicate a theory.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reference to the “time asker” as a role played by Karl Largie is portrayed as
    if it reflected a paradigm shift or abrupt late course correction originated by
    the trial judge and eagerly grasped by a desperate prosecutor.  The trial
    record does not bear out this characterization.  This is not a case, like <i>Ranger</i>,
    of material prejudice. The supportive evidence was there. Counsel knew of this
    alternative and ridiculed it in his final address as a desperate, last-ditch, salvage
    attempt.  There were no surprises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal fails.</p>
