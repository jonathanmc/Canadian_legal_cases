  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    November 29, 2006, at around 8:45 p.m., the appellant drove his Subaru Legacy
    westbound along North Lake Road in Richmond Hill.  He was returning home from his girlfriend’s
    house.  It was dark outside, but there
    were street lights illuminating the roadway.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>North
    Lake Road runs generally east and west.  In the area where the accident occurred, the road curves gently to the
    south, requiring westbound traffic to carry out a gradual left turn.  There is a cement curb on the north edge of
    the road.  To the north of the curb there
    is a grassy area, then a sidewalk and then residential homes.   The posted speed limit at the time was 50
    kilometres per hour.  The appellant lived
    in, and was familiar with, the area.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    he drove westbound, the appellant failed to negotiate the gradual southward
    turn on North Lake Road.  His car mounted
    the north curb, crossed the grassy area and went onto the sidewalk.  While still travelling west, the appellant’s
    car struck and damaged the rear of a Dodge Neon motor vehicle that was parked
    in the driveway of one of the residences.  The appellant’s car continued westerly and struck a substantial concrete
    street lamp pole, knocking it down.  The
    car then re-entered the travelled portion of North Lake Road and travelled a
    further distance before it came to a stop.  The trial judge described the condition of the appellant’s car as being
    “for all intents and purposes, demolished”.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    victim, Teresa Callaway, aged 37, lived on the north side of North Lake Road
    with her husband and four children.  She
    was jogging that evening.  During the
    course of the events described above, the appellant’s car struck Ms. Callaway
    and propelled her face first into the side of the Dodge Neon.  She suffered massive injuries and died almost
    immediately.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    police were called to the scene.  The
    appellant was arrested and subsequently provided two breath samples.  Blood alcohol readings of 130 milligrams of
    alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood were recorded on the certificate.  A forensic alcohol toxicologist called by the
    Crown testified that at the time of the accident, the appellant’s blood alcohol
    level would have been between 130 and 170.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown and the defence each called an accident</span> <span class=GramE>reconstructionist</span><span
lang=EN-US>.  In the opinion of the Crown’s witness, the appellant struck Ms. Callaway
    while she was on the sidewalk facing in a westerly direction.  The witness opined that, at the point of
    impact, the appellant was travelling at or above a speed of between 90 to 93
    kilometres per hour.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    defence expert testified that the Crown’s evidence was flawed.  It was his opinion that the evidence at the
    scene was not conclusive, either as to the point of impact or the speed the
    appellant was travelling.  In his view,
    it was not possible to determine accurately whether Ms. Callaway was on the
    road or on the sidewalk when the appellant’s car struck her.  In addition, the defence expert was of the
    view that the appellant’s car could have been travelling at a much lower rate
    of speed than 90 to 93 kilometres per hour.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge found that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol
    at the time of the accident.  He also
    found that the appellant’s driving was dangerous in that it was a marked
    departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have
    observed in the appellant’s situation.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant’s impaired state and his dangerous
    driving <span class=GramE>were</span> significant contributing causes of Ms.
    Callaway’s death.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge did not make a finding as to the specific speed at which the
    appellant was driving at the time of the accident.  Rather, he concluded that the appellant was
    travelling at a “significant speed” to have caused the massive damage to the
    Neon, the cement light pole, his own car and to Ms. Callaway.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge also did not make a finding about whether the appellant struck Ms.
    Callaway on the road or on the sidewalk.  In essence, he found it did not matter because in either case, he was
    satisfied that the appellant’s impaired driving and dangerous driving were
    significant causes of Ms. Callaway’s death.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Conviction Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    oral argument, counsel for the appellant made only two submissions with respect
    to the conviction appeal.  First, he
    argued that because the trial judge failed to resolve the competing theories of
    whether the appellant’s car struck Ms. Callaway on the road or on the sidewalk,
    it was unreasonable for him to conclude that the appellant’s impairment or his
    dangerous driving caused her death.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge considered the issue of causation with respect to both the road and
    the sidewalk scenario.  He reasoned as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>That
    scenario [impact on the sidewalk], however, does not constitute the only means
    or exclusive route to conviction on the facts of this case.  An impaired ability driver is no more
    licensed to strike a pedestrian on the roadway than on the sidewalk.  It is a matter of degree, and involves an
    appreciation and an analysis of all the circumstances.  The precise location and movements of Mrs.
    Callaway at the time of the impact are not determinative of the issue of
    whether [the appellant’s] impaired <span class=GramE>ability, [or]</span> dangerous driving … caused her death.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, this line of reasoning was open to the trial judge.  I see no basis to interfere.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant’s second argument as to conviction was that the rule against multiple
    convictions arising out of the same delict precluded convictions for both
    impaired driving and dangerous driving.  In view of this court’s decision in <i>R.
    v. Ramage</i>, 2010 ONCA 488, the appellant has abandoned this ground of
    appeal.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Sentence Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge sentenced the appellant to five years’ imprisonment on the charge
    of impaired driving causing death and three years concurrent on the charge of
    dangerous driving causing death.  He
    imposed a driving prohibition of 10 years following the appellant’s release
    from custody.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant raises three arguments with respect to sentence.  He argues that the trial judge misapprehended
    certain facts, erred in failing to give the appellant credit for the time spent
    under a restrictive pre-trial bail order and erred in imposing a custodial
    sentence that exceeded the appropriate range.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(a)  Factual Findings</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge sentenced the appellant based on facts that
    were not supported by findings he made in his reasons for convicting the
    appellant or by the evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his reasons for sentence, the trial judge said, “[t]he motor vehicle
    reconstruction evidence indicates that [the appellant] was travelling at a
    speed estimated at between 90 to 93 kilometres per hour when he struck Teresa
    Callaway.”</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant points out that the trial judge did not make a finding of fact as to
    the specific speed the appellant was travelling in his reasons for
    conviction.  Thus, he argues, the trial
    judge erred in sentencing the appellant by making a specific finding as to
    speed.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    disagree.  In his reasons for conviction,
    the trial judge found that the appellant was travelling at a “significant
    speed” having regard to the massive destruction he caused.  Obviously, 90 to 93 kilometres is a
    significant speed in the location where this accident occurred.  I do not consider the two findings –
    “significant speed” and “90 to 93 kilometres per hour” to be inconsistent.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition, as I read the trial judge’s reasons for sentencing, not a great deal
    turns on his conclusion about a specific speed.  He mentioned it once at the beginning of those reasons when he was
    setting out the facts and not again.  Thereafter, he referred to the appellant travelling at a “significant
    speed”, and noted as a potentially aggravating factor that the appellant was
    driving at almost twice the posted speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour, suggesting
    that he saw the two as interchangeable.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would not interfere with the sentence on the basis of the manner in which the
    trial judge addressed the speed issue.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge erred by misapprehending the
    evidence about the level of the appellant’s impairment.  In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge
    referred to “the high alcohol readings” and the fact that the appellant
    operated a motor vehicle while he was “significantly impaired”.  The appellant submits that the readings of
    130 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood are not “high alcohol
    readings” and that there was no evidence that the appellant was “significantly
    impaired”.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Again,
    I see no error.  I am not convinced that
    much turns on the trial judge’s use of the word “high” to describe the
    breathalyzer readings.  The trial judge,
    who hears impaired driving cases on a regular basis, would be very aware that
    some accused have readings higher than those in this case.  That said<span class=GramE>,</span> a reading
    of 130 is “high” in the sense that it is well above the prescribed limit.  The readings are what they are.  I do not see any error in the trial judge’s

    appellant also argues that the trial judge overstated the appellant’s level of
    impairment when in his reasons for sentence he described the appellant as being
    “significantly impaired”.  I
    disagree.  In his reasons for convicting
    the appellant, the trial judge referred to several factors to support the
    conclusion of significant impairment.  Most prominent, in my view, was the appellant’s very dangerous driving
    that caused havoc in the area where he struck Ms. Callaway.  In addition, a toxicologist called by the
    Crown testified that the appellant’s blood alcohol level would have resulted in
    a decrease in alertness, a significant disruption in reaction time, impairment
    of visual tracking, a decrease in peripheral vision and an increased propensity
    to take risks.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    a number of the appellant’s comments or actions after the accident showed a
    lack of awareness of the circumstances in which he found himself.  For example, when a person at the scene
    pointed out to him that there was a woman lying on the ground, the appellant
    responded that he was coming back from his girlfriend’s house and that there
    was no one in the car with him </span></p>

    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in imposing sentence without
    determining whether the appellant struck Ms. Callaway on the road or on the
    sidewalk.  I see no error.  While impaired by alcohol, the appellant drove
    through a residential neighbourhood at a high rate of speed in an extremely
    dangerous manner.  The consequence, Ms. Callaway’s
    death, was enormous.  Whether the
    appellant struck Ms. Callaway on the road or the sidewalk, this was a very
    serious offence.  The trial judge quite
    properly treated it as such.  I see no
    error in his failure to determine the point of impact.</span></p>

    severe.  As a result, a sentencing judge
    may give an accused credit for time spent under pre-trial bail conditions.  In <i>R.

    “[t]ime spent on stringent pre-sentence bail conditions, especially house
    arrest, is a relevant mitigating factor”.  Rosenberg J.A. pointed out, however, that while a sentencing judge must
    consider giving credit for the impact of pre-trial bail conditions, credit is
    not automatic, even where the offender has been subject to house arrest.  A sentencing judge should consider the
    circumstances of a particular case and decide what credit, if any, should be
    given.  When sentencing judges decide against
    giving credit, they should set out their reasons for the decision.  See also, <i>R.

    restrictive”.  In declining the request
    for credit, the trial judge attached weight to a number of factors.  The appellant was convicted of breaching a
    term of his bail order on one occasion.  In addition, the appellant’s efforts to find employment during the 28
    months he was on bail were “far from overwhelming”.  During that time, he was employed for eight
    or nine months.  Moreover, while the
    appellant was on bail, he sought some relaxation of his terms – unsuccessfully
    – only once, shortly after his arrest.  During
    the last approximately two years he was on bail, the appellant did not seek an
    adjustment to any of his bail conditions. </span></p>

    the appellant argues that the sentence of five years’ imprisonment is outside
    the range of sentences that courts impose for offences of impaired driving
    causing death for first offenders.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    begin by noting that courts should be cautious in rigidly applying “a range” of
    sentences in cases such as this, involving impaired driving causing death.  In <i>R.
    v. Heaslip</i> (2001), 10 M.V.R. (4th) 220 (Ont. C.A.), in dismissing a Crown
    appeal from a sentence for two counts of impaired driving causing death and one
    count of impaired driving causing bodily harm, this court said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>In <i>R v. L.
    (J.)</i></span></span><span lang=EN-US> [(2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 299 (Ont. C.A.)], this Court also recognized that
    cases involving drinking and driving did not demonstrate a particular range of
    sentencing but rather that the sentences were driven by the almost “infinite
    variety of circumstances in which this offence can be committed”. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Clearly,
    sentences imposed by courts in earlier decisions provide guidance as to an
    appropriate sentence.  However, appellate
    interference may only be justified if the sentence imposed at trial is
    demonstrably unfit.  In <i>R. v. Hall</i> (2007), 83 O.R. (3d) 641
    (C.A.), at para. 29, LaForme J.A. described the test as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>appellate</span> interference may
    only be justified if the sentence is demonstrably unfit; that is, the sentence
    imposed is “clearly unreasonable” or a “substantial and marked departure from
    the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing similar
    crimes.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    am not satisfied that the five year sentence imposed by the trial judge in this
    case is “clearly unreasonable”.  The
    trial judge recognized, correctly in my view, that the overriding sentencing
    principles in drinking and driving offences, particularly where death is
    involved, are denunciation and general deterrence.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge considered the appellant’s background, including the fact that he
    had no previous record but concluded that the serious nature of the offence
    warranted a significant penitentiary term.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
    are a number of factors that make this offence serious.  The appellant made a choice to drive his car
    while his ability was impaired.  In doing
    so, he took the risk that his driving would endanger other members of the
    community.  That risk materialized and
    the consequences were enormous.  A family
    has been shattered.  Teresa Callaway was
    killed.  Her husband is left without a
    loving spouse.  Her four young children
    will grow up without their mother.  The
    sentence imposed should reflect the serious consequences that flowed from the
    appellant’s decision to drive while impaired.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    the appellant’s blood alcohol level was not as high as that in some other cases,
    the way he drove his car, which can only be explained by his impairment,
    presented enormous risks to the lives and safety of others.  The appellant drove through a residential
    neighbourhood at a sufficiently high rate of speed to cause a huge amount of
    property damage.  His car careened off
    the roadway, seemingly out of control, hit another car which was parked in a
    residential driveway and knocked down a concrete lamp post.  By the time the appellant’s car finally
    stopped, it was a virtual wreck.  In the
    process, the appellant struck and killed Ms. Callaway and did not appear to
    realize he had done so.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, a sentence of five years for this offence cannot be said to be “a
    substantial and marked departure” from the sentences ordinarily imposed on
    similar offenders for similar offences.  In recent years there has been an upward trend in the length of
    sentences imposed for drinking and driving offences.  The reasons for this trend can be attributed
    to society’s abhorrence for the often tragic circumstances that result when
    individuals choose to drink and drive, thereby putting the lives and safety of
    others at risk.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    imposition of substantial penalties for drinking and driving offences sends an
    important message to individuals who are considering driving while their
    ability is impaired.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    the length of sentences in cases of impaired driving causing death varies
    considerably, courts have imposed sentences approaching or similar to the
    five-year sentence under appeal in this case.  In the recent case of <i>Ramage</i>,
    this court upheld a sentence of four years for impaired driving causing death.  In <i>R.
    v. Niganobe</i>, 2010 ONCA 508, this court upheld a sentence of five years for
    impaired driving causing death. <i> </i>In <i>Hall</i>,
    this court upheld a sentence of four years and 10 months for the same
    offence.  In <i>Hall </i>and <i>Niganobe</i>, the
    offenders had previous related records.  In <i>Ramage</i>, the offender did
    not.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    recognize that sentences of four to five years for first offenders may be at
    the high end of sentences imposed by the courts to this point in time.  That said, I do not think that a sentence of
    five years for this offence is unfit.  Nor is it a significant departure from sentences previously imposed so
    as to warrant interference by this court.  While the sentence in this case may be seen as a slight movement
    upwards, I am satisfied that the increase, if there is one, is incremental and that
    it quite properly continues the very gradual trend that has taken place over
    recent years.</span></p>

    sentencing.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prior
    to imposing sentence, the trial judge ordered a pre-sentence report.  In his report, the probation officer painted
    a very negative picture of the appellant.  He portrayed the appellant as a person who lacked remorse for what he
    had done, had a poor attitude towards work, had not pursued needed counselling
    and had “contempt for court orders”.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fortunately,
    Mr. Herman, the appellant’s counsel at trial, cross-examined the probation
    officer to great effect.  As to the
    appellant’s remorse, the cross-examination showed that the probation officer
    relied almost entirely on the superficial observations of a single police
    officer whom the probation officer erroneously believed was the arresting
    officer.  The probation officer did not
    speak to two other police officers who had more contact with the appellant and
    who testified at trial that the appellant was remorseful.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    cross-examination also disclosed that the appellant had provided the probation
    officer with a report from a counsellor who had seen the appellant on several
    occasions after the accident.  In his
    report, the counsellor indicated that “it was clear that remorse and regret and
    guilt very much occupied [the appellant’s] mindset and contributed to the host
    of depressive symptoms”.  The probation
    officer made no reference to this part of the counsellor’s report in the
    pre-sentence report.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    probation officer also did not speak about the appellant’s remorse to any of
    the individuals whose names the appellant provided to him.  All of those people would have said that the
    appellant was remorseful.  In short, the
    pre-sentence report presented a misleading and unfair picture about the issue
    of the appellant’s remorse.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    pre-sentence report was also deficient in other respects.  For example, the report painted an incomplete
    picture of the appellant’s work record.   The report also implied unfairly that the
    appellant was somehow at fault for not continuing counselling after the
    accident.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    I said above, it was fortunate that Mr. Herman’s cross-examination exposed the
    deficiencies in the report.  The trial
    judge recognized those deficiencies.  He
    said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Through
    the efforts of Mr. Herman, it became obvious that there were significant
    factual issues with the pre-sentence report as it related to the defendant’s
    ability to work, his medical issues, and a number of other issues, and the
    court is indebted to have obtained a more clear picture of Mr. Junkert’s
    situation over the course of the last two and a half to three years, and even
    before.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given
    the trial judge’s approach to the pre-sentence report, it is understandable
    that the appellant did not raise the inadequacy of the report as a ground of
    appeal.  I see no basis to interfere with
    the sentence on the basis of the report.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
    said<span class=GramE>,</span> I raise the issue of the pre-sentence report
    here for two purposes.  First, I think it
    is important to note the problems that became apparent with the pre-sentence
    report in this case so that hopefully similar problems do not arise in the
    future.  A pre-sentence report is
    intended to be an accurate, independent and balanced assessment of an offender,
    his background and his prospects for the future.  When preparing pre-sentence reports,
    probation officers must be thorough and fair and should canvass the relevant
    information before commenting on a particular issue.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Clearly,
    it is an acceptable practice for probation officers to speak to arresting
    police officers and other police officers who may provide useful information
    about an offence and the offender.  However, a pre-sentence report is intended to be more than a mere report
    of what the police think about the offence or the offender.  Probation officers are professionals.  They have an obligation to the court and the
    parties to canvass all of the relevant information and to provide a
    professional assessment that the court can rely upon.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    second reason that I have raised the issue of the pre-sentence report is out of
    fairness to the appellant. The report painted the appellant as a person lacking
    genuine remorse when there is significant evidence to the contrary.  I am concerned that the Parole Board, when
    considering the issue of the appellant’s release, not be misled by the
    inaccuracies in the pre-sentence report.  The Parole Board should look at the full record which includes the
    testimony of all of the police officers at trial, the counsellor’s report and
    the letters filed by the appellant at the time of sentencing which were not
    challenged by the Crown.</span></p>
