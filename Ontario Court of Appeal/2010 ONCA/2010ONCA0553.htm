    Cheadle as Petrone acknowledges that all amounts paid to it are a credit in
    favour of the Appellants.  The
    application judge concluded that, as a matter of contractual interpretation,
    the Settlement Agreement did not provide a credit in favour of the Appellants
    in respect of legal fees and disbursements paid to Cheadle prior to the
    execution of the Settlement Agreement.  The Appellants do not appeal this finding of the application judge.  Instead, they assert on the appeal that the
    absence of any such credit should have been taken into account by the
    application judge in assessing the fairness and reasonableness of the
    Settlement Agreement.</span></p>

    the application judge addressed the fairness and reasonableness of the
    Settlement Agreement in the context of a consideration of whether special
    circumstances existed that would entitle the Appellants to an assessment under section
    4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. S.15 (the “Act”).  He concluded that
    special circumstances did not exist.  This is addressed further below.</span></p>

    stated in the decision of the application judge, the Appellants did not dispute
    that Petrone was a party to, or otherwise entitled to the benefit of, the
    Settlement Agreement.  We have proceeded
    on the same basis based on the position taken by the Appellants in their Notice
    of Application and confirmation of their counsel in the hearing before us.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, the application
    judge proceeded on the basis that, if he found there were no special
    circumstances that warranted an order directing an assessment under section 4
    of the Act, there were no other legal issues to be addressed in determining the
    entitlement of Petrone and Cheadle under the Settlement Agreement. Having found
    there were no such special <span class=GramE>circumstances,</span> the application
    judge therefore determined that Cheadle and Petrone were entitled to the
    amounts set out above.  These amounts represent
    the amounts due to each of them respectively in accordance with the terms of
    the Settlement Agreement, subject to a credit in respect of Petrone equal to
    the amounts paid previously to that firm.</span></p>

    on this appeal that the Settlement Agreement was either unenforceable as not
    being fair and reasonable for purposes of section 24 of the Act or,
    alternatively, should not be enforced by the Court in the exercise of its
    inherent jurisdiction to supervise solicitors’ accounts.  They also submit that the application judge erred
    in law in addressing the operation of section 4 of the Act.  They acknowledge, however, that if the
    Settlement Agreement is an enforceable agreement, Cheadle and Petrone are
    entitled to the amounts declared to be owing to each of them by the order of the
    application judge.</span></p>

    appeal is whether the application judge held that the Settlement Agreement was
    fair and reasonable and, if so, whether he erred in doing so. Before addressing
    this issue, however, it is necessary to consider two other issues of a
    preliminary nature raised by the Appellants.</span></p>

    judge did not err as a matter of law in considering the issue of the fairness
    and reasonableness of the Settlement Agreement in the context of section 4 of
    the Act, rather than in the context of section 24. It is clear from the
    transcript of the hearing that, on the hearing of the application, the
    Appellants presented the issue, at least in part, in these terms.  It is also clear that the only argument
    regarding the presence of special circumstances that the application judge addressed
    was the allegation that the Settlement Agreement was unfair and unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, we are satisfied

    Appellants raised the more general issue of whether the Settlement Agreement
    was enforceable as a contingency fee agreement given the provisions of the Act
    at the time of execution of the Agreement.  This requires a separate conclusion of this issue in respect of each of Cheadle
    and Petrone.</span></p>

    that the Settlement Agreement is an agreement to which the Act applies insofar
    as it pertains to Cheadle. To this end, the Appellants rely on the language in
    the concluding phrase of the definition of a “client” in section 15 of the Act,
    which in its entirety is defined as a “person who, as principal, or on behalf
    of another person, retains or employs or is about to retain or employ a
    solicitor, and a person who is or may be liable to pay the bill of a solicitor
    for any services”.  The Appellants argue
    that, under section 15 of the Act, a client includes a person whose
    relationship with a solicitor is being terminated on the ground that such
    person is “liable to pay the bill of a solicitor for any services”.  From this conclusion, they argue that the
    Settlement Agreement is an agreement to which sections 17 to 33 of the Act
    apply.</span></p>

    section 28 of the Act as it read at the time of execution of the Settlement
    Agreement rendered that Agreement unenforceable:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Nothing in sections
    16 to 33 gives validity to a purchase by a solicitor of the interest or any
    part of the interest of his or her client in any action or other contentious
    proceeding to be brought or maintained, or gives validity to an agreement by
    which a solicitor retained or employed to prosecute an action or proceeding
    stipulates for payment only in the event of success in the action or
    proceeding, or where the amount to be paid to him or her is a percentage of the
    amount or value of the property recovered or preserved or otherwise

    to extend the definition of a client to persons who have terminated a retainer,
    they could easily have done so within the structure of the definition of a
    client in section 15 by referring to persons who retain or employ, <i>have retained or employed</i>, or are about
    to retain or employ, a solicitor. The absence of language speaking to the previous
    engagement of a solicitor is significant. The concluding phrase in the
    definition cannot be relied upon to remedy the absence of any direct language
    on this issue, particularly given the fact that it also addresses an important
    and quite different circumstance of a guarantor.  </span></p>

    agreement for the purposes of sections 17 to 33 of the Act.  In the absence of any issue of the
    application of sections 24 or 28 of the Act, we conclude that the Settlement
    Agreement is an enforceable agreement as between the Appellants and Cheadle,

    accords with the policy behind the Court’s authority to review the fairness and
    reasonableness of retainer agreements under section 24 of the Act.   In the Settlement Agreement, the parties
    terminated their relationship and provided for a highly speculative payment to
    Cheadle for past services as an alternative to immediate assessment of fees
    otherwise payable by the client.  Such an
    agreement raises none of the issues pertinent to contingency fees that have
    invoked the Court’s inherent jurisdiction to address such agreements.</span></p>

    the arrangements pertaining to Petrone contemplated by the Settlement Agreement
    constitute an unenforceable contingency fee agreement in respect of Petrone
    also rests on the operation of section 28 of the Act.  For its part, Petrone does not dispute that
    the arrangements in respect of it under the Settlement Agreement constitute an
    agreement to which sections 17 to 33 of the Act apply.  It is, however, unclear whether Petrone takes
    the position that these arrangements constituted a contingency fee agreement or
    an agreement to “cap” legal fees at a stipulated level, i.e. an agreement to
    limit whatever premium for success might otherwise be appropriate.  At the hearing before the application judge,
    counsel for Petrone took the position that these arrangements did not
    constitute a contingency fee arrangement; at the hearing of this appeal,
    counsel took the contrary position.  The
    significance of this issue is addressed below. </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:200%'><span

    characterization of such arrangement, however, Petrone argues that such
    agreements were not void <i>ab initio</i> under the legislation as it existed in 2000.  We agree.  Insofar as the
    arrangement in respect of Petrone under the Settlement Agreement constituted no
    more than an agreement on the part of Petrone to limit its fees to the
    proportion of any settlement funds contemplated for such purpose under the
    Settlement Agreement, no issue of enforceability arises in respect of section
    28 of the Act.  Insofar as the
    arrangement constituted a contingency fee agreement, section 28 of the Act as
    it existed in 2000 did not render contingency fee agreements void <i>ab initio</i>.  This is implicit in the decision of this
    Court in <i>Rafael Partners v. Lam</i> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.) per Cronk J.A., which indicates that the
    enforceability of such agreements is subject to a determination under section
    24 of the Act.  Accordingly, it is
    necessary to consider the conclusions of the application judge that the
    Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable.</span></p>

    fails to satisfy the standard of fairness and reasonableness.  In addition, they argue that, insofar as the Settlement
    Agreement pertains to Cheadle, the Court should declare the Agreement to be
    unenforceable in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to supervise
    solicitors’ accounts. </span></p>

    of considerations they submit should have been taken into account by the application
    judge in assessing whether the Settlement Agreement was fair. They say his
    failure to do so constituted a palpable and overriding error. In particular,
    they suggest that the application judge should have considered the financial
    pressure under which Chrusz found himself at the time of the mediation.  They also say that the Court should conclude
    that he did not receive independent legal advice in respect of the Settlement
    Agreement.  </span></p>

    grounds for reaching the conclusion that the arrangement in the Settlement
    Agreement in respect of Cheadle was fair in the sense contemplated for the
    purposes of section 24 of the Act.  The
    fact that Chrusz had invested almost $150,000 in the litigation does not, by
    itself, render the arrangements under the Settlement Agreement unfair. There is
    also no basis for finding the Settlement Agreement to be unfair based on a lack
    of independent legal advice. Chrusz was an experienced businessman.  There is no evidence that, at any time, he
    failed to understand fully the nature of the agreement in respect of
    Cheadle.  He suggested mediation to
    forestall assessment and immediate payment of the Cheadle account. He suggested
    the final arrangement to the parties after the mediation had initially failed,
    with the benefit of consultation with the mediator who was his own solicitor on
    an appeal in the litigation.  He also had
    the benefit of advice from Petrone. In any event, there is no automatic
    requirement for independent legal advice when entering into an agreement with a
    solicitor for legal services. </span></p>

    implicit in his disposition of the application that the application judge also
    concluded that the arrangement in the Settlement Agreement in respect of
    Petrone was fair, he does not expressly address this issue in his Reasons.  Moreover, the manner in which the application
    judge addressed the arrangements pertaining to Petrone raises two further
    issues.  </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:200%'><span

    might be charged if <span class=SpellE>Petrone</span> were successful by some
    definition of “success”? In the absence of such determination, it is not
    possible to address the fairness of these arrangements.  One cannot answer the question of whether

    event, however, we conclude that the application judge did not err in
    concluding that the Agreement was reasonable in respect of <span class=SpellE>Cheadle</span>,
    notwithstanding the considerations raised by the Appellants, for two
    reasons.  First, the current rules
    pertaining to contingency fee arrangements do not apply retrospectively.  Second, while these provisions identify
    considerations that should be taken into account, they must be addressed as
    part of an evaluation of the totality of the arrangement between Cheadle and
    the Appellants. The particular elements of the arrangement identified by the
    Appellants are not such as to render the arrangement unreasonable on their own. </span></p>

    reasonably conclude on the totality of the evidence that the fee arrangements
    pertaining to Cheadle under the Settlement Agreement were reasonable, given the
    other considerations identified in his decision.  As the application judge observes, Cheadle
    traded the right to immediate taxation and payment of outstanding fees for a
    position that entailed considerable risk of non-payment as a result of a number
    of considerations.  In addition, the
    Appellants cannot complain today that there was no information regarding the
    amount of the Cheadle account given their decision to forestall an assessment
    and seek mediation with a view to reaching an alternative arrangement.  Effectively, by proceeding in this manner and
    not requesting formal accounts at the time, they waived their entitlement to

    the services he provided. He also addresses the legal complexity of the matters
    at issue in the litigation and the results achieved.  Hornack concludes by setting out the Petrone
    claim pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. In addition to the <span

    indicating hours worked on the file.  Nor

    calculation of the premium charged by Petrone on the file.  Chrusz does not dispute that a premium is
    payable in the circumstances but does object to the quantum sought by
    Petrone.  Accordingly, the evidence
    before the application judge as to the time expended, and if relevant, the premium
    charged, was of a qualitative, rather than a quantitative, nature.</span></p>
