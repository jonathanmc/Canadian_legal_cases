  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A citizen called Ottawa Police reporting that the
    vehicle in front of him was being driven erratically as though the driver were
    intoxicated.  The citizen remained on the
    phone with police as the arresting officer was dispatched to the area.  Before the officer arrived, the vehicle
    driven by the respondent collided with the rear end of a truck parked at the
    side of the road.  Within roughly a
    minute of arriving at the scene, and without asking the respondent if he had
    been drinking or how the accident happened, the officer arrested the respondent
    for impaired operation.  At the station,
    the respondent provided breath samples that analyzed over the legal limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In pre-trial applications, the respondent
    unsuccessfully argued the arresting officer lacked reasonable and probable
    grounds to make an <i>Intoxilyzer </i>demand
    and arrest him and that his right to consult with counsel of choice was
    breached.  After a trial, the respondent
    was found guilty of impaired driving and “over 80” with the “over .80” count
    conditionally stayed.  He received a
    $700.00 fine and 12 month driving prohibition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his summary conviction appeal (SCA), the respondent
    argued the trial judge erred in reversing the onus on the s. 8 <i>Charter </i>application, in finding the
    officer had objective reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath
    demand, and in failing to “adequately articulate” her reasons for concluding
    there was no breach of s. 10(b), as well as that the finding was
    unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge allowed the appeal
    and ordered a new trial, finding the trial judge reversed the onus and that he
    was not satisfied the trial judge assessed the totality of the surrounding
    circumstances in determining if the officer had reasonable and probable
    grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal, and if leave is

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would grant leave to
    appeal, allow the appeal and restore the conviction.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after midnight on April 17, 2004, the
    respondent was driving his Nissan Murano on Colonel <span class=GramE>By</span> Drive.  Before turning onto Bank St., a
    taxi that was behind him flashed its high-beam lights about six times.  Vincent <span class=GramE>Paolucci</span> who
    was driving behind the taxi, saw the respondent swerve towards the curb.  Twenty feet further up the road the
    respondent bounced off the curb.  After
    another twenty feet, the respondent drove up onto the curb, missing a
    light-post by about one and one half feet.  Paolucci called 9-1-1 reporting his location, that he was following <span
class=GramE>a silver</span> Nissan that was bouncing off the curb and that he
    believed the driver to be impaired.  He
    remained on the phone with the dispatcher, following the Nissan until it struck
    the rear end of a four-by-four GMC truck parked at the roadside.  His numerous attempts to get the respondent’s
    attention by flashing his lights had no effect. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable Lucas was dispatched to intercept the Nissan.  While he did not hear what Mr. Paolucci told
    the operator, the dispatcher told him a civilian reported erratic driving and
    believed the driver was intoxicated.  In
    his 18 years as a police officer, Constable Lucas found that type of
    information reliable.  Before he was able
    to intercept Mr. Bush, the respondent collided with a truck parked against the
    right curb in a well-lit residential area.  The collision’s force propelled the truck across other lanes of traffic
    and into a light pole, snapping off its rear axle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the accident scene, Constable Lucas saw the
    extensively damaged truck and the respondent’s vehicle with extensive front-end
    damage. He spoke very briefly with Mr. Paolucci who confirmed he made the call
    to police and identified the respondent as the Nissan’s driver.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer “bee-lined” it to the respondent who was
    standing beside the Nissan and asked if he was okay.  The respondent had a dazed look on his face
    and said he was.  The officer noted an
    odour of alcohol on his breath, red and glassy eyes and that he was weaving
    back and forth while standing.  Within “a
    minute give or take” of his arrival,  Constable Lucas arrested the respondent for impaired driving and made an <i>Intoxilyzer </i>demand as a result of his
    observations of the respondent, the information he received from the dispatcher
    and the accident itself.  As regards the
    accident, the roads were clear and dry and the speed limit was 40 k/hr.  Earlier that shift, the officer had seen the
    GMC truck parked fully to the right side of the road and observed the distance
    the truck was moved by the impact.  When
    making his observations of the respondent, the officer took into consideration
    that he had been in an accident in which his air bags deployed.   Constable Lucas still believed the
    respondent’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer acknowledged that on the basis of what the
    dispatcher told him he had no grounds upon which he could believe the
    respondent’s ability to drive was impaired by the consumption of alcohol and
    that he had never asked the respondent if he had been drinking or how the
    accident occurred.  He agreed that it is
    not unusual for the powder from airbags to get into the eyes and cause redness
    and watery eyes.  After he had been arrested,
    the respondent told the paramedics that he did not know whether he was
    injured.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Charter </i>Ruling</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argued the arresting officer objectively
    lacked reasonable and probable grounds to arrest and make a breath demand.  He also argued that his rights to counsel
    were violated when he selected a lawyer from a list of counsel who <span
class=GramE>were</span> prepared to accept “off hour” calls and no message was
    left when the counsel could not be reached.  The respondent then provided police with the name of a lawyer and on two
    occasions spoke to that counsel.  On the
    s. 10(b) application the alleged breach was that the lawyer selected from the
    list was his counsel of choice and the officer failed to facilitate contact
    with that particular counsel.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of the <i>Charter</i> ruling, the trial judge correctly noted the Crown had the
    burden of proving that reasonable grounds existed for the breath sample demand,
    relying on <i>R. v. Haas</i>, (2005), 76
    O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 423.  She identified the issue on the reasonable
    and probable grounds argument as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, defence counsel conceded, during his
    extensive cross-examination, that Lucas subjectively had reasonable and
    probable grounds for arrest.  The issue
    to be determined at present is whether those grounds are justifiable from an
    objective point of view as per our Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Storrey v. <span class=GramE>The Queen<span
style='font-style:normal'> (1990), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (S.C.C.).</span></span></i>  This is particularly so as this is an arrest
    without a warrant.  <i>Storrey </i>makes plain that an officer is not obliged to establish a <i>prima face </i>case for conviction before
    making the arrest.  An arrest which is
    lawful does not become unlawful simply because the officer intends to continue
    the investigation post arrest.  <i>Storrey </i>also addresses the context of
    drinking and driving investigations and the need to strike a balance between
    our rights as citizens to liberty and the need to protect society and its
    citizens from the menace of impaired drivers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found the arresting officer was
    entitled to rely on the civilian’s opinion regarding the driver’s
    intoxication.  She further found that an
    officer receiving that type of information was not required to obtain
    confirmatory evidence before acting on it, citing <i>R. v. Golub </i>(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.).  Mr. Paolucci was similarly situated to the
    civilian whose information was relied upon by the officer in <i>Golub</i>; having observed the erratic
    driving, called police, and followed the car.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that she had to look at the
    grounds collectively and not individually.  In assessing whether reasonable and probable grounds existed, she found
    that the absence of some of the usual indicia of impairment did not detract from
    the probative value of those observed.  While defence counsel had focused on the observations that were not made
    and non-alcohol related explanations for those that were, the trial judge
    concluded it was “not an exercise in building blocks where the incriminatory
    grounds lose value in the face of the absence of certain other usual
    grounds.”  An explanation for one
    indicator of impairment such as red and glassy eyes did not render the
    officer’s observations unreliable.  Finally, the trial judge found it was not necessary for the officer to
    have administered an Approved Screening Device before arresting the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of reasonable and probable grounds, the
    trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The accused has the burden of proving, on a balance
    of probabilities that his rights were violated.  He has failed to do so and the motion is denied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found no s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>breach.  The
    respondent selected the first lawyer from a list of names of counsel who were
    prepared to receive after-hours calls.  There was no answer at that lawyer’s number.  The trial judge found the respondent told the
    officer not to leave a message and concluded that when the respondent gave the
    officer the name of a lawyer he knew and had used, that it was reasonable for
    Constable Lucas to be satisfied that the second lawyer was, as of then, his
    counsel of choice.  The <span
class=GramE>officers</span> facilitated contact with the lawyer on two
    occasions before the first breath sample was taken.  The respondent never expressed any
    dissatisfaction with the second lawyer’s advice <span class=GramE>nor</span> any desire to speak to the first lawyer after he began consulting the
    second.  In these circumstances, the
    weight of evidence pointed to the second lawyer as the respondent’s lawyer of
    choice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In convicting the respondent, the trial judgment’s
    first paragraph contains the following comment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In separate reasons
    issued on February 7, 2005 this Court reviewed in detail the evidence of the
    arresting officer, presented by the Crown, and ruled that [the] defence had not
    proven the alleged <i>Charter</i> violations
    on the required balance of probabilities.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The SCA
    Judgment</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal court quoted from the
    trial judgment’s reference to <i>Storrey</i>,
    noting it was an aggravated assault case, not a case of impaired driving and
    that the trial judge used virtually identical language to that in <i>R. v. Censoni</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 5189
    (S.C.).  The SCA judge accepted the
    respondent’s argument that <i>Censoni </i>inappropriately
    created a lower standard of reasonable and probable grounds to be applied in
    drinking and driving cases.  The summary
    conviction appeal judge concluded, “[c]onsequently, there is no express
    reduction in the standards required for a lawful arrest as set out in <i>Storrey </i>to meet the highway carnage
    referred to in newspaper editorials across the country with respect to drinking
    and driving.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice on appeal continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge referred to this phenomenon in
    these words: “Every year, drunk driving leaves a terrible trail of death,
    injury and destruction.”<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  But notwithstanding such judicial concerns Sopinka,
    J. noted in <i>Bernshaw </i>(1994), 95
    C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) that “the requirement of s. 254(3) that reasonable and
    probable grounds exist is not only a statutory but a constitutional requirement
    as a precondition to a lawful search and seizure under s. 8 of the Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Section
    8 requires that reasonable and probable grounds exist in fact and not that
    their presence can be deemed to exist notwithstanding the evidence.”  It seems to me that the trial judge may have
    overlooked this caveat set out [by] Sopinka, J. in <i>Bernshaw</i>, <i>supra.  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice on appeal noted the arrest was made within
    a minute of Constable Lucas arriving at the accident and without him making
    further inquiries of either Mr. Bush or Mr. Paolucci.  The respondent was standing around and it
    appeared he would have been there as long as the officer wanted to
    investigate.  The appeal judge continued:
    “[i]t may be that the officer thought that alcoholic breath plus an accident
    equals impaired by alcohol.”  He found
    the accident “muddied the waters,” as Ratushny J. held in <i>R. v. Uppal</i>, 1995 CarswellOnt 4566 (Prov. Ct.), a case the justice
    on appeal found was factually similar to the matter before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice on appeal also found that the trial judge
    reversed the burden of proof, constituting reversible error as it was “not
    possible to understand [the trial judge’s] analysis of the evidence if the
    persuasive onus was erroneously placed on the accused to justify the
    reasonableness of the search.”  The
    justice on appeal appeared troubled by “numerous references” in the reasons to
    the respondent’s failure to testify which may also have resulted from the onus
    she erroneously placed on the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I cannot be satisfied that the trial result would
    have been the same had the onus been placed properly on the Crown.  On the basis that the only satisfactory
    remedy for a bad trial is a new trial which I so order, I do not consider it
    necessary to deal with the grounds of appeal argued under s. 10(b) and I make
    no determination on that issue since those grounds will probably be argued at
    the new trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Counsel for the Crown
    argued that the trial judge’s misplaced onus produced no reversible error, but
    I reject that notion because I have come to different conclusions based on how
    the trial judge marshaled the evidence.  I am not satisfied that she assessed the totality of the surrounding
    circumstances.  In the circumstances
    there will be an order for a new trial before a different judge of the Ontario
    Court at Ottawa.</p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>The Leave Application</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. R.R.</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), Doherty J.A. summarized the test to be applied
    on leave applications pursuant to s. 839 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  While there
    is no single litmus test, the key variables are the significance of the legal
    issues raised to the general administration of criminal justice and the merits
    of the proposed grounds of appeal.  If
    the grounds have significance to the administration of justice beyond the
    particular case, leave may be granted where the grounds are arguable, even if
    they are not particularly strong.  Where
    the merits appear very strong, leave may be granted even if the issues have no
    general importance.  This is particularly
    so where the convictions are serious and the accused faces significant
    deprivation of his liberty.  <i>  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits the appeal judge erroneously endorsed
    an approach to reasonable and probable grounds that excludes from consideration
    any indicia of impairment which could be attributed to another cause and
    requires officers to conduct interviews before determining if reasonable and
    probable grounds exist.  The Crown
    submits the appeal judge erred by applying <i>Uppal</i>,
    a case that was wrongly decided, and asks this court to express its
    disapproval. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also contends the trial judge’s misstatement
    regarding the onus has to be viewed in the context of the entire judgment,
    including that she expressed the onus correctly at the outset of her
    reasons.  Finally, the Crown submits the
    appeal judge erroneously quashed the conviction in a case where the Crown’s
    evidence was very strong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits the reasonable and probable
    grounds issue is entirely fact-driven and includes no unsettled question of
    law.  As regards the onus, there is no dispute
    between the parties regarding the applicable law.  The only issue is whether in this case the
    trial judge reversed the burden.  Mr.
    Paciocco also submits that if this court allows the appeal and restores the
    conviction, the respondent will be deprived of his right to have an appellate
    ruling on the s. 10(b) issue because the justice on summary conviction appeal
    did not address that issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, and forcefully, the respondent argues that
    leave should be refused because of the delay in the Crown perfecting the
    appeal.  Written reasons on the summary
    conviction appeal were released on May 20, 2008.  This appeal was argued on March 17, 2010, 21
    months later.  The Crown’s Notice of
    Application for Leave to Appeal and Notice of Appeal was filed on June 8,
    2008.  The last transcript for the appeal
    was available on July 8, 2009.  In those
    circumstances, the appellant had until October 8, 2009 to perfect the appeal:  <i>Criminal
    Appeal Rules</i>, Rule 18(3).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By Notice of Application dated November 20, 2009, the respondent
    applied to have the appeal dismissed for delay.  In support of the application, the respondent filed an affidavit stating
    that he “lived under a constant fear and a cloud of suspicion” since the date
    the application for leave was filed.  He
    had been fearful that “at any moment he could lose his license.”  The intervening period had been an immensely
    stressful time in his professional and personal life.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s Appeal Book and Factum were filed on
    November 24, 2009.  On November 27, 2009,
    the return date for the application, Sharpe J.A. held that the motion was moot
    because the appeal had been perfected.  However, Sharpe J.A. also held that the respondent could argue that
    leave should not be granted because of the delay before the panel hearing the
    appeal.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am persuaded that leave to appeal should be granted
    notwithstanding the inordinate delay in perfecting the appeal.  Drinking and driving offences have the
    highest trial rate of any offences in the Ontario Court of Justice.  The reasonable and probable grounds to make
    breath demands and arrests are frequently contested in those trials especially
    where alternative, non-alcohol-related explanations emerge for the observed
    “usual” indicia of impairment.  Along
    with the absence of some of the “usual” indicia of impairment, the nature of
    the required pre-arrest investigation and the relevance of an accident are
    frequently litigated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i> </i>I agree that the summary conviction appeal
    judge implicitly endorses an approach that excludes from consideration some
    “explained” observed indicia of impairment in determining if reasonable and
    probable grounds existed, requires investigating officers to conduct interviews
    in assessing their reasonable and probable grounds, and finds that an accident
    and alcoholic breath cannot provide reasonable and probable grounds.  Those findings conflict with binding and
    persuasive authorities to the contrary.  In fairness to the SCA judge, not all of the authorities that were
    relied upon on this appeal were brought to his attention.  I am persuaded that the issues relating to
    reasonable and probable grounds have significance to the administration of
    justice beyond the facts of this case.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, I would grant leave to appeal on the issue
    of whether the trial judge reversed the burden of proof because the summary
    conviction appeal judge did not address the trial judge’s correct statement of
    the law at the outset of the reasons or whether when reading the reasons as a
    whole it was clear the trial judge reversed the onus.   While the legal issues are not in dispute,
    the failure to refer to the correct statement of the onus and consider the
    issue in the context of the entire reasons merits review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining that I would grant leave, I have
    considered the inordinate delay in perfecting the appeal and the respondent’s
    unchallenged affidavit regarding the effects of the delay.  This issue has been addressed in previous
    judgments with clear warnings that significant delays will not be
    tolerated:  see <i>R. v. Moreno-Baches</i>, 2007 ONCA 258; <i>R. v. Oliveira, </i>2009 ONCA 219: and <i>R. v. Davis-Harriot</i>, 2010 ONCA 161.   Delays such as the one in this case, or
    longer, tell against arguments that the issue is of importance to the general
    administration of criminal law.  However,
    delay is but one factor to be considered.  I have also considered that there were 21 months between the conviction
    date and the date on which the respondent’s SCA was heard. </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Reasonable and Probable Grounds in Drinking
    and Driving Cases</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge found the trial judge erroneously
    proceeded on the basis that there was a reduced standard for reasonable and
    probable grounds in drinking and driving cases.  He also implied the trial judge determined the requisite standard was

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Drinking and driving prosecutions involve a continuum
    of <span class=GramE>findings,</span> beginning with a reasonable suspicion the
    driver has alcohol in his or her body, the standard for an Approved Screening
    Device (roadside) demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  At the other
    end of the continuum, is the standard for conviction, proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the operator’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by
    the consumption of alcohol or that the driver’s blood alcohol concentration was
    over the legal limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between suspicion and proof beyond a reasonable doubt <span
class=GramE>lies reasonable and probable grounds</span>.  Section 254(3) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>authorizes peace officers to demand <i>Intoxilyzer</i> breath samples provided the
    officer “has <i>reasonable and probable</i> <i>grounds</i> to believe that a person is
    committing or at any time within the preceding three hours has committed” the
    offence of impaired operation or driving ‘over 80.’  (emphasis added)  <span class=GramE>Reasonable and probable
    grounds does</span> not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt or to a <i>prima face </i>case:  see <i>Censoni</i> at para. 31 and <i>R. v. Shepherd</i> 2009
    SCC 35 at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasonable and probable grounds have both a subjective
    and an objective component.  <span
style='color:black'>The subjective component requires the officer to have an honest
    belief the suspect committed the offence:  <i>R. v. </i></span><i>Bernshaw</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254 at para.
    51.  The officer’s belief must be
    supported by objective facts:  <i>R. v. Berlinski</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 377
    (C.A.) at para. 3.  The objective
    component is satisfied when a reasonable person placed in the position of the
    officer would be able to conclude that there were indeed reasonable and
    probable grounds for the arrest: <i>R. v.
    Storrey</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241 at p. 250.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the SCA judge correctly noted that <i>Storrey </i>involved the validity of the
    arrest for aggravated assault, not impaired driving, I am not persuaded the
    trial judge inappropriately applied a reduced standard below reasonable and
    probable grounds.  In <i>Censoni</i>, Hill J. wrote at para. 42:<i> </i><u></u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>In <i>Storrey v.</i></span><i> The Queen,

    the menace of impaired drivers. Every year, drunk driving leaves a terrible
    trail of death, injury, and destruction: <i>The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The importance of this requirement to citizens of a
    democracy is self-evident. Yet society also needs protection from crime. This

    crime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to address the problems of drinking and
    driving, Parliament enacted a two-stage scheme for testing for driver
    impairment, the first involving roadside breath tests and the second, what <span
class=GramE>has become the <i>Intoxilyzer </i>tests</span>. <u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What the trial judgment and <i>Censoni </i>appropriately examine is the context in which the officer’s
    reasonable and probable grounds obligations operate.  Neither advocated a standard of less than
    reasonable and probable grounds.  Both
    examined reasonable and probable grounds in the context of a roadside
    investigation, an approach that is consistent with judgments of the Supreme
    Court of Canada and this court.  Even
    under the <i>Charter</i>, reasonable and
    probable grounds can mean different things in different contexts:  see <i>R.
    v. Jacques</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 312 at para. 20; <i>Bernshaw, per</i> L’Heureux-Dubé J. at para. 97; <i>Censoni </i>at para. 38.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Golub</i>, Doherty
    J.A. held that it did not follow that information that would not meet the
    reasonableness standard on an application for a search warrant would also fail
    to meet that standard in the context of an arrest, beginning at para. 18:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both a justice and an arresting
    officer must assess the reasonableness of the information available to them
    before acting. It does not follow, however, that information which would not
    meet the reasonableness standard on an application for a search warrant will
    also fail to meet that standard in the context of an arrest. In determining
    whether the reasonableness standard is met, the nature of the power exercised
    and the context within which it is exercised must be considered. The dynamics
    at play in an arrest situation are very different than those which operate on
    an application for a search warrant. Often, the officer's decision to arrest
    must be made quickly in volatile and rapidly changing situations. Judicial
    reflection is not a luxury the officer can afford. The officer must make his or
    her decision based on available information which is often less than exact or
    complete. The law does not expect the same kind of inquiry of a police officer
    deciding whether to make an arrest that it demands of a justice faced with an
    application for a search warrant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The justice asked to issue a search warrant based
    on information provided by a police source is in a very different position than
    the police officer who is face to face with the complainant. The justice asked
    to issue a search warrant based on information provided by a police source
    cannot assess the reliability of that secondhand information without additional
    information from the officer pertaining to the reliability of the officer's
    source. The police officer faced with a complaint from a witness to events has
    information from a firsthand source and can question that source, if necessary.
    To the extent that the position of the justice and the arresting officer can be
    compared at all, the officer acting on a complaint from a witness to the
    relevant events is in a similar situation to a justice who acts on firsthand
    information provided by the police officer.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding whether reasonable grounds exist, the
    officer must conduct the inquiry which the circumstances reasonably permit. The
    officer must take into account all information available to him and is entitled

    Stellato</i> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 90 (C.A.), aff’d [1994] 2 S.C.R. 478.  Slight impairment to drive relates to a
    reduced ability in some measure to perform a complex motor function whether
    impacting on perception or field of vision, reaction or response time,
    judgment, and regard for the rules of the road:  <i>Censoni</i> at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test is whether, objectively, there were reasonable

    review the trial judge’s conclusions as to whether the officer objectively had
    reasonable and probable grounds, the appellate court must show deference to the
    trial judge’s findings of fact although the trial judge’s ruling is a question

    was acquitted in what the SCA judge found were similar circumstances to this

    accident in which he hit his head on the windshield.  The trial judge found the driver’s incoherent
    and dazed state, unsteadiness and apparent unawareness that there had been an
    accident were very possibly attributable to the effects of the accident.  She found the indicia that were independent
    of the effects of the accident were the strong odour of alcohol, the hearsay
    information from dispatch that there was a possible impaired driver involved
    and the fact an accident had occurred.  In these circumstances, the only factors the officer could rely upon
    were those unrelated to the accident.  Her Honour concluded, “Because of the accident, the visible and
    extensive damage to the vehicle, some apparent head injury to the accused and
    an obvious dazed state, the other indicia should not have been relied upon.”</p>

    was not justifiable.  What was <span

    considered: see <i>Shepherd </i>at para. 21; <i>R. v. Rhyason</i>, 2007 SCC 39; <i>R. v. Elvikis</i> [1997] O.J. No. 234 at
    para. 26; <i>Censoni</i> at para. 47.  That an accident occurred, including the
    circumstances under which it occurred and the possible effects of it, must be
    taken into account by the officer along with the other evidence in determining
    whether there are reasonable and probable grounds to arrest for impaired
    driving.  Consumption plus an unexplained
    accident may generate reasonable and probable grounds although that may not
    always be the case:  <i>Rhyason</i>, <i>supra</i> at para.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing whether reasonable and probable grounds
    existed, trial judges are often improperly asked to engage in a dissection of
    the officer’s grounds looking at each in isolation, opinions that were
    developed at the scene “without the luxury of judicial reflection”: <i> Jacques </i>at para. 23; also<i> Censoni </i>at para. 43.   However, it is neither necessary nor
    desirable to conduct an impaired driving trial as a threshold exercise in
    determining whether the officer’s belief was reasonable: <i> R. v. McClelland, </i>[1995]
    A.J. No. 539 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An assessment of whether the officer objectively had
    reasonable and probable grounds does not involve the equivalent of an impaired
    driver scorecard with the list of all the usual indicia of impairment and
    counsel noting which ones are present and which are absent as the essential
    test.  There is no mathematical formula
    with a certain number of indicia being required before reasonable and probable
    grounds objectively existed<span class=GramE>;  <i>Censoni</i></span> at para.
    46.  The absence of some indicia that are
    often found in impaired drivers does not necessarily undermine a finding of
    reasonable and probable grounds based on the observed indicia and available
    information:  <i>R. v. Costello</i> (2002), 22 M.V.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 165 (Ont. C.A.)

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consideration of the totality of the circumstances
    includes the existence of an accident.  However, that the accident could have caused some of the indicia relied
    upon when they could also have been caused by the consumption of alcohol does
    not mean the officer has to totally eliminate those indicia from
    consideration:  <i>R. v. Duris</i>, 2009 ONCA 740 at para. 2.  They have to be considered along with all the
    other indicia in light of the fact there may be another explanation.  To the extent that <i>Uppal </i>determines otherwise, with respect, it was wrongly decided. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here the investigating officer testified that he took
    into consideration that the respondent had been in an accident.  In assessing whether reasonable and probable
    grounds objectively existed, the trial judge appropriately considered that
    there had been an accident.  However,
    that there might be another explanation for some of the factors the officer
    properly took into account in forming his opinion of impairment to drive did
    not eliminate the indicia or render them unreliable.   I am persuaded that the appeal judge erred
    in finding the trial judge had permitted the accident to muddy the waters and
    failed to assess all the surrounding circumstances.   </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argued that the arrest within a minute
    or less of the officer’s arrival amounted to a “rush to justice,” and that more
    investigation was required before making the arrest, including making a
    roadside breath demand, asking the respondent if he had been drinking and
    asking the respondent and other witnesses at the scene how the accident
    happened.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no minimum time period nor <span class=GramE>mandatory

    reasonable and probable grounds.  There
    is no requirement that a roadside sample be taken.  The ASD provides evidence of the blood
    alcohol concentration in the suspect’s blood, not evidence of impairment.  The trial judge correctly found that if the
    officer subjectively and objectively had reasonable and probable grounds that
    withstand judicial scrutiny, the failure to invoke the roadside screening
    provisions was irrelevant.  If the

    consideration that experience and training in assessing whether he objectively
    had reasonable and probable grounds:  <i>Censoni</i> at paras. 36 and 37.  In addition, in determining whether
    reasonable and probable grounds exist, the officer is entitled to rely on

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Costello</i>,
    a case not provided to the summary conviction appeal judge, Rosenberg J.A.
    provided an informative analysis of reasonable and probable grounds.  Police were dispatched to a coffee shop on
    Highway 401 regarding an “intoxicated male.”  When the officer arrived three civilians told him “he is on the off ramp
    exit in the Green Thunderbird.”  The
    officer did not stop for further information but proceeded to the ramp and
    stopped the Thunderbird.  The driver got
    out of the vehicle without difficulty and approached the officer who noted an
    immediate odour of alcohol from the driver; his eyes were bloodshot and he
    swayed from side to side.  The officer
    arrested the driver for impaired operation.  Notwithstanding that the driver did not exhibit many of the usual
    indicia of impairment, the trial judge found the officer had reasonable and
    probable grounds to arrest the driver and make a breath demand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his summary conviction appeal (reported at [2001]
    O.J. No. 2109 (S.C.)) the court found that objectively the officer lacked
    reasonable and probable grounds to arrest because some of the “normal” indicia
    of impairment were absent and the officer had not personally interviewed the
    witnesses who had called police to report an “intoxicated male,” thereby
    precluding the officer or the judge from evaluating the reasonableness or
    accuracy of the observation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In restoring the conviction at the Court of Appeal,
    Rosenberg J.A. held that the absence of some indicators that are commonly found
    in an impaired driver did not undermine the finding of reasonable grounds based
    on the tip from the civilian, as confirmed by the officer’s own observations
    that the respondent was swaying, had an odour of alcohol and had blood-shot
    eyes.  </p>

    officer did not ask the accused how the accident occurred or if he had been
    drinking.  After being at the scene for a
    few minutes, he arrested Rhyason who had admitted he was the driver who struck
    the pedestrian.  Rhyason was crying and
    had bloodshot eyes, blinked slowly, was shaking and had a moderate odour of
    alcohol on his breath: see also <i>R. v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In making his or her determination, the officer is not
    required to accept every explanation or statement provided by the suspect:  <i>Shepherd</i> at para. 23.  <i> </i>That the officer turned out
    to be under a misapprehension is not determinative:  <i>Censoni</i> at para. 35.  The important fact is not
    whether the officer's belief was accurate.  It is whether it was reasonable at the time of the arrest. That the
    conclusion was drawn from hearsay, incomplete sources, or contained assumptions
    will not result in its rejection based on facts that emerge later. What must be
    assessed are the facts as understood by the peace officer when the belief was
    formed:  <i>R. v. Musurichan</i>, [1990] A.J. No. 418 (C.A.). <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An officer is required to assess the situation and

    if necessary:  <i>Golub </i>at para. 19.  In
    others, the officer’s observations and information known at the time may
    readily establish the requisite grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the officer could have asked the respondent if he
    had consumed alcohol.  What weight the
    officer attached to the answer would have been for the officer to
    determine.  If he said he had one beer or
    nothing to drink, the officer was not required to accept what he was told and
    terminate the investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer could have asked the respondent how the
    accident occurred.  However, if he
    provided an explanation unrelated to intoxication, the officer was not required
    to accept the explanation and eliminate the accident from consideration.  At trial, the respondent admitted that he hit
    the curb because he was making cell phone calls and looking up numbers as he
    drove.  His cell phone records confirmed
    he made six calls to his girlfriend which were continually disconnecting within
    five minutes of the accident.  Continuing
    to make telephone calls while driving into curbs could also <span class=GramE>be</span> seen as a sign of impairment:  see <i>Shepherd</i> at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue is not whether the officer could have
    conducted a more thorough investigation.  The issue is whether, when the officer made the breath demand, he
    subjectively and objectively had reasonable and probable grounds to do so.  That the belief was formed in less than one
    minute is not determinative.  That an
    opinion of impairment of the ability to operate a motor vehicle can be made in
    under a minute is neither surprising nor unusual.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the officer could rely on the report of erratic
    driving that appeared to be consistent with the driver being intoxicated, that
    the driver had struck a truck the officer knew was parked at the extreme side
    of the road with ample space for cars to pass, propelling the truck to the
    other side of the road, that the respondent had the odour of alcohol on his
    breath, bloodshot eyes, and was swaying.  Finally, when the officer asked the respondent if he was okay he said
    that he was.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this record, the trial judge considered the

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The
    Reversal of the Burden of Proof</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of the written <i>Charter </i>ruling the trial judge correctly noted that because the
    breath samples were obtained as a result of a warrantless search the onus was
    on the Crown to establish Constable Lucas had reasonable and probable grounds
    to make the demand referring to <i>Haas,
    supra</i>.  At the end of the “reasonable
    and probable grounds” section of the ruling, however, the trial judge concluded
    that the respondent had not met the onus of establishing the breach on a
    balance of probabilities.  Without
    reference to the initial correct statement regarding the onus, the summary
    conviction appeal judge found the trial judge committed reversible error by
    reversing the onus.  He found it was not
    possible to understand the trial judge’s analysis of the evidence if the persuasive
    burden was erroneously placed on the respondent to justify the reasonableness
    of the search.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the summary conviction appeal, the Crown, not Mr.
    Webb, argued that the reasons had to be read as a whole to determine if the
    onus was reversed although he agreed that at one point the trial judge
    “oversimplifies the onus” and may very well have misstated it.  In this court, the Crown submits for the
    first time that the trial judge was referring to the s. 9 application when she
    referred to the onus being on the respondent.  On that application, the onus was properly on the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the last two sentences of the reasonable
    and probable grounds analysis, the respondent relies on three instances in the
    reasonable and probable grounds Reasons when the trial judge noted the respondent
    did not testify on the <i>Charter </i>application
    in support of his argument that the onus was reversed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the respondent relies upon the trial judge’s
    reference at the outset of the trial judgment that the respondent had failed to
    meet the onus on all <i>Charter </i>applications.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial judge’s failure to apply the correct burden of
    proof is an error of law.  In determining
    whether the trial judge erred, the reasons must be read as a whole and not held
    to an abstract standard of perfection.  Misstatements do not necessarily undermine the reasons, requiring
    appellate intervention:  <i>Rhyason, supra</i> at para. 10.  In <i>Rhyason</i>,<i> </i>the trial judge said the officer
    required only evidence of consumption, not impairment, before making an <i>Intoxilyzer </i>demand.  The majority held that when the reasons were
    read as a whole that was not the test the trial judge applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>F.H. v.
    MacDougall</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41, the Supreme Court provided guidelines for
    examining allegations the trial judge applied an incorrect standard of proof. <i> </i>Where
    the judge does not express an opinion on the onus, it will be presumed that the
    correct standard was applied because trial judges are presumed to know the law
    with which they routinely work:  <i>R. v. Burns, </i>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at
    664.  Where the judge states the onus
    correctly, it will be presumed it was correctly applied in the absence of a
    clear indication to the contrary.  Finally, where the trial judge expressly states the incorrect onus, it
    will be presumed that it was applied in that manner:  <i>F.H. </i>at
    para. 54.  Here, where conflicting onuses
    were stated, it is necessary to examine the balance of the reasons to determine
    if the onus was correctly applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I am not persuaded that the trial judge was
    referring to s. 8 in the opening paragraph and s. 9 in the last two sentences
    of the reasons.  The trial judge made no
    reference to s. 8 or s. 9 of the <i>Charter </i>in
    the reasons.  In the reasonable and
    probable grounds segment she used “demand” and “arrest” interchangeably.  In <i>Shepherd</i>,
    released after the summary conviction appeal in this case, the Supreme Court,
    in examining reasonable and probable grounds in a drinking and driving case
    involving an accident, noted that none of the three courts below had examined
    the issue in reference to s. 9, concluding at para. 14 “based on the facts of
    this case, nothing would be added by an analysis under s. 9.”  The same comments apply here.  It is difficult to see why the trial judge
    would refer to the s. 9 application for the first time in the concluding
    sentences of her analysis.  Examining the
    attempt to draw a distinction between the different <i>Charter </i><span class=GramE>applications,</span> does not assist in
    determining whether the trial judge applied the correct onus.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am also not persuaded the trial judge’s references to
    the respondent not testifying assists in determining if the onus was
    reversed.  The first reference was in the
    same paragraph in which the onus was correctly stated and immediately following
    a reference to the respondent’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>application upon which he had the onus.  The second reference correctly noted there was no evidence the officer
    made an angry comment to the respondent because the officer denied it in
    cross-examination and the respondent did not testify.  The final reference was in relation to the
    respondent’s physical condition after the accident, an area the respondent
    relied upon as evidence of an “innocent” explanation for the observed indicia
    of impairment.  The trial judge fairly
    noted the respondent gave no evidence about his physical symptoms on the <i>voir dire</i>.  Finally, all three references occur in the
    portion of the reasons where the evidence is being reviewed and not in the
    analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of greater importance are the trial judge’s four
    references in four paragraphs in the course of the s. 10(b) analysis to his
    failure to testify on the application – an application upon which he had the
    onus.  In those same paragraphs the trial
    judge found that it bore repeating that the burden was on the respondent.  When contrasted with the absence of
    references to the respondent not testifying in the reasonable and probable
    grounds analysis, these aspects of the reasons support an inference the correct
    onus was applied.  I would also note that
    trial counsel saw fit to file 53 cases <span class=GramE>on  reasonable</span> and probable grounds and 59
    on the right to counsel.  The trial judge
    reserved judgment and reviewed all the cases.  It is reasonable to conclude that the trial judge had the correct onus
    repeatedly reinforced when reading those cases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reviewing the reasons and eliminating the conflicting
    onus references, there is no indication that the wrong onus was applied.  At one point, the trial judge <span
class=GramE>emphasized  that</span> it
    was a warrantless search albeit without reference to its impact on the
    onus.  Her Honour in examining and
    rejecting the defence submissions provides valid reasons why  there was no rush to judgment, that an ASD
    breath sample was not required, and why the absence of some of the usual
    indicia of impairment and “innocent” explanations for some that were observed
    did not result in a breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The trial judge states several non-onus
    related principles correctly, finds the facts were similar to <i>Squires</i> and that Mr. Paolucci was
    similarly situated to the civilian in <i>Golub</i>.  <i>Squires </i>and <i>Golub </i>were both cases
    involving warrantless searches with the onus on the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eliminating the conflicting onus references, two
    aspects of the rulings are problematic.  First, at the outset of the trial judgment, six months after the <i>Charter </i>ruling, the trial judge noted
    that in previous reasons she had “ruled that [the] defence had not proven the
    alleged <i>Charter </i>violation<u>s</u> on
    the required balance of probabilities.”  (emphasis added) The reference to multiple violations reflected the
    blended nature of the <i>voir dire</i>.<i>  </i>While
    the respondent bore the onus on the s. 10(b) application, the Crown bore the
    onus on the s. 8 application because it was a warrantless search.  Second, it cannot be suggested that the <i>Charter </i>ruling references were slips of
    the tongue because both were written reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, however, having reviewed the reasons as a
    whole and applying <i>F.H.</i>, I am
    satisfied the trial judge applied the correct test, notwithstanding her
    contradictory bookend remarks at the beginning and end of her analysis.  The trial judge stated the correct onus at
    the outset with a reference to binding authority and misstated it six pages
    later.  The onus on a warrantless search
    is a law with which trial judges routinely work.  I am persuaded the erroneous two lines are
    more a reflection of being drafted and edited without the required diligence
    and not a reflection of the onus that was applied.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the trial judge applied the wrong onus,
    however, it would have made no difference.  She considered the appropriate factors in arriving at her decision on
    reasonable and probable grounds, and arrived at the correct decision because,
    applying the earlier analysis, the Crown had established the officer
    objectively had reasonable and probable grounds.  The result would inevitably have been the
    same:  s. 686 (1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iii).</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US

    Right to Counsel Issue</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s argument that if the conviction were
    restored he would be deprived of appellate review of the trial judge’s
    dismissal of his s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>application
    because the summary conviction appeal judge did not deal with the issue, can be
    dealt with briefly, having reviewed the complete transcript of the respondent’s
    argument on the issue on the summary conviction appeal.  Counsel argued the trial judge failed to
    “adequately articulate” her reasons for dismissing the s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>application and sought to
    challenge the trial judge’s “incorrect” findings of fact that “misapprehended
    and failed to consider some of the essential evidence,” arguing Constable Lucas’
    evidence on the issue was neither credible nor reliable.  It was “quite Darwinian” as it evolved over
    the course of the dates upon which he testified as new information was brought
    to his attention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the respondent was entitled to raise any additional
    issues not referred to by the Crown in opposing the appeal:  <i>Perka
    v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232.  The respondent did not raise the s. 10(b) ruling as an additional
    issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the alleged s. 10(b) breach occurred at the
    station after the respondent’s arrest and would not have resulted in the
    exclusion of the pre-breach evidence, the evidence upon which he was convicted
    of impaired operation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial judge made findings of fact that were
    available on the evidence and provided adequate reasons in support of her
    factual conclusions.  While the officer
    had few notes on the right to counsel issue, she found that his credibility was
    not undermined.  Her Honour reviewed the
    issues raised by counsel during his vigorous cross-examination of the
    officer.  That the respondent disagrees
    with those findings or indeed that another judge might have reached a different
    conclusion is not the test on appeal.  Provided the findings are reasonable, as here, the appellate court is
    not entitled to re-try the case and substitute its view of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the trial judge’s factual findings, the
    respondent selected a name off a list, the call was made without success and he
    did not ask that a message be left.  He
    then provided the officer with the name of a lawyer of his own independent
    selection whose name was not on the “after hours” list, the officer located the
    number in the phone book and the respondent spoke to that lawyer twice before
    providing breath samples.  The trial
    judge’s key factual finding was that it could not be said the first lawyer
    remained his counsel of choice once he provided the name of a lawyer with whom
    he had previous dealings in the absence of any evidence by the respondent.  There could be no challenge to the
    informational or implementational component of the rights to counsel in regards
    to the counsel whose name he provided. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no evidence the respondent had any connection
    with the first lawyer, nor any evidence the advice he received from the counsel
    he next turned to for assistance was in any way defective.  In these circumstances, the argument that the
    first lawyer was his only true counsel of choice had no reasonable prospect of
    successfully establishing a breach or excluding any evidence.  Even if there was no call made to the first
    lawyer as the respondent contended on the SCA based on the first lawyer’s phone
    records and the cross-examination, in spite of the officer’s notation “01:04
    selects Bloom -2666554 no answer” and his investigative action report notation,
    “Bush did not want to leave a message,” the argument that the first lawyer was
    his only true counsel of choice had no reasonable prospect of successfully
    establishing a breach or excluding any evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, there is no unfairness to the
    respondent. </p>
