  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 9, 2008, Justin Bisson was convicted by McLeod
    J. of the Ontario Court of Justice of sexually assaulting his former girlfriend
    and was sentenced to 9 months in jail and 18 months probation.  His appeal to the Superior Court was
    dismissed on December 4, 2009.  Mr.
    Bisson now seeks to appeal to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In keeping with the courts current policy, counsel were
    asked first to argue the motion for leave to appeal.  The leave motion was argued on the grounds
    that the summary conviction appeal judge made an error in applying the curative
    proviso on his own initiative.  The
    Supreme Court has stated clearly that the proviso should only be applied upon
    submission from a party: <i>R v. Pétel</i>,
    [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 31.  See also <i>R. v. McMaster</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 740<i>, </i>at para. 37.  Leave to appeal was granted for the reasons
    given orally.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Briefly summarized, the following is the factual
    back-drop to this matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the complainant, university students who
    had previously been involved in a relationship with each other, met at the
    appellants apartment to have a few drinks and watch television prior to going
    their separate ways upon graduating.  There is no issue over the fact that the two engaged in sexual activity
    in the early morning of Saturday, May 12, 2007. The dispute is over whether
    intercourse took place and, more significantly, whether the sexual conduct that
    did occur was consensual.  The appellant
    testified that there was no intercourse and that all sexual conduct was
    consensual.  The complainants evidence
    was that the appellant raped her twice and that she did not consent to any
    interaction of a sexual nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the complainant left the appellants apartment, she
    was in disarray, without her shoes or keys.  A friend at her residence let her in and then contacted her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend called the police.  However, when the police arrived, the complainant
    told them that nothing had happened.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The day after the incident, the appellant met with the
    complainant at her request.  While their versions
    of the conversation differ, both agreed that they discussed obtaining
    counselling for the complainant and that there was at least some mention of his
    paying her wages for the summer.  The
    next day, the appellant looked for a counsellor for the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after the incident, the complainant went to a
    campus nurse for STD testing and then to the police and reported what had
    happened.  The police brought her to
    Sudbury Regional Hospital where she was seen by another nurse who observed bruising
    and scratches on her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Monday after the incident, the appellant met with Mr.
    Roberge, his warrant officer in the Canadian Armed Forces.  Mr. Roberge testified that the appellant told
    him that he had forced himself onto the complainant and that digital vaginal
    penetration had taken place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge convicted the appellant mainly on the
    basis that he had substantially confirmed the complainants version of events
    in his confession to Mr. Roberge, leaving no room for reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge found that the
    trial judge erred by improperly using the complainants prior consistent
    out-of-court statements to support his finding of credibility in her favour but
    dismissed the appeal by applying the proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES    </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in the
    following five respects: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He failed to deal with motive to fabricate; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He engaged in a piecemeal treatment of the evidence; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He erred in applying the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i>; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He improperly used the complainants prior out-of-court
    statements to bolster her credibility; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was unable to make a finding as to whether
    intercourse had taken place, and therefore must have been left with a
    reasonable doubt regarding the complainants credibility.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i><span
lang=EN-US>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><i><span
lang=EN-US>Motive to fabricate </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argued before the summary conviction
    appeal judge that the trial judge failed to address the complainants motive to
    fabricate, namely that she had to explain to her boyfriend the fact of her
    sexual encounter with the appellant.  The
    summary conviction appeal judge found that the trial judge implicitly
    considered this argument and then rejected it in the following paragraph.   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If this was simply a case of being anxious to get
    home because she was late to head off Jonathan Woodgate [her current
    boyfriend], to stop him from making enquiries which might lead to the
    disclosure that shed been having sexual relations with another man, why did
    she pick an opportunity when Justin Bisson was out of commission and unable to
    interfere?  Why was she emotionally
    distraught?  If she wanted to avoid any
    situation developing with Jonathan Woodgate why would she put herself into a
    situation where an explanation was mandatory because of her condition? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this court, the appellant argues that even if the
    motive to fabricate may have been implicitly addressed, in this paragraph the
    trial judge went beyond a common sense analysis of the complainants
    behaviour and assumed the truth of her allegations.  In my view, this submission has no merit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the trial judge concluded that the
    complainants behaviour was not consistent with an attempt to ward off her boyfriends
    predictable suspicions of what went on at the appellants apartment.  He recognized that, in fact, her behaviour
    did quite the opposite.  Her dishevelled
    and distraught condition drew attention to her and was not consistent with an attempt
    to cover up a sexual liaison. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is exactly the kind of common sense analysis that
    would be expected in the circumstances, and I see no error in it.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i><span
lang=EN-US>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><i><span
lang=EN-US>Piecemeal analysis of the evidence</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   The appellant next
    argues that the trial judge engaged in a piecemeal analysis of the evidence by
    considering the appellants testimony only where it conflicted with Mr. Roberges.  I agree with the summary conviction appeal
    judge that the trial judge was careful in his approach to the evidence and I
    adopt his statement that although [the trial judge] did not, aside from the
    conflicting evidence of Mr. Roberge, set out express reasons why he rejected
    the contentious parts of Mr. Bissons evidence, I am satisfied that he indeed
    considered the testimony of the accused in arriving at this verdict. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i><span
lang=EN-US>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><i><span
lang=EN-US>The rule in Browne v. Dunn</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the rule in <i>Browne
    v. Dunn</i>, I agree with the summary conviction appeal judge that the trial
    judge made little, if any, use of the fact that the appellants version of what
    he said to Mr. Roberge was not put to Mr. Roberge in cross-examination.  The trial judge did not specifically find that
    the appellants credibility was negatively affected by this failure. I see no
    merit in this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i><span
lang=EN-US>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><i><span
lang=EN-US>The use of the complainants prior out-of-court statements to
    bolster her credibility</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the two main grounds of appeal counsel for the
    appellant advanced in oral argument is that the trial judge improperly relied
    upon the complainants prior consistent statements to bolster her credibility.  The statements said to have been improperly
    relied upon by the trial judge are the complainants statements to the nurse
    that she had been sexually assaulted, her discussion with Bisson regarding
    counselling and wages, and her report to the police of the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the complainant gave diametrically
    opposed evidence on the central issue of consent.  The credibility of both parties was therefore
    central to the case.  The trial judge was
    careful not only to set out the approach mandated by the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. W.D. </i>(1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397
    (S.C.C.) but also to follow it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was clear that the trial judge did not believe the
    appellants evidence regarding consent and that it did not raise a reasonable
    doubt because it contradicted the appellants earlier, freely-given confession
    to Mr. Roberge. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>My sole purpose in looking at [Mr. Bissons]
    testimony is to see if it raises a reasonable doubt on the principal
    issue.  Was the sexual activity on
    consent?...In light of [his confession to Mr. Roberge] the substantial elements
    of [the complainants] account of what happened in that apartment, those
    elements are confirmed out of the mouth of the accused.  There is no room in this case for reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of whether the Crowns evidence established
    lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt, the real focus of the analysis at
    trial and the argument before the summary conviction appeal judge was the complainants
    credibility.  In this respect, the most
    significant aspect of the evidence that the trial judge had to deal with was
    that her testimony that she had been sexually assaulted was inconsistent with
    her initial statement to the police that nothing happened.  The trial judge referred to this
    inconsistency at the outset of his reasons as the strongest argument in terms
    of [the complainants] reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant points to the following paragraph as
    evidence of the trial judges error in relying on the complainants
    out-of-court statements in support of her credibility. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She met with Justin Bisson because something
    happened that they needed to talk about.  They discussed counselling because something happened for which she
    needed counselling.  They discussed
    monetary compensation for the time she would lose from work because something
    happened that would cause her to lose time from work.  She went to the clinic to be checked because
    something happened.  She went to the
    police and complained about Justin Bisson because something happened.  She came to court and testified because
    something happened.  Thats her
    explanation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What Ive been saying is my distillation of her
    explanation of why shes here even though she said to the police that night
    nothing happened.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge expressed concern
    over this, as follows.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This second group of statements, in the context
    used by the trial judge, do not appear to have been considered solely as
    narrative.  In my view, by accepting this
    view of the complainants explanation, the trial judge may have used her out of
    court statements to improperly bolster her credibility relative to the
    allegation that she had been sexually assaulted by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was on this issue that the summary conviction appeal
    judge incorrectly applied the proviso when he went on to say:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That I have found the trial judge to have used
    prior consistent statements of the complainant improperly does not necessarily
    mean that appellate relief is to be granted.  That requires a consideration of whether a substantial wrong or
    miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that prior consistent statements
    are generally inadmissible because they are viewed as lacking probative value
    and are self-serving: <i>R. v. Stirling</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 272, at para. 5.  Had the
    trial judge considered the complainants out-of-court statements to Mr. Bisson,
    to the nurse, or to the police, as confirming her version of the events, this
    would indeed be an error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge did not, in my view, use the
    out-of-court statements in this way.  Rather, read in context, the trial judges review of the complainants statements
    appear to have been considered as part of the narrative recounted by the
    complainant.  At no point does the trial
    judge indicate that he is relying on these statements for the truth of their
    contents or that they formed part of his decision to prefer the complainants
    evidence as to what happened on the night in question to that of the appellant.
    I therefore do not agree with the summary conviction appeal judges finding
    that the trial judge ... used [the complainants] out-of-court statements to
    improperly bolster her credibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge properly considered the
    complainants explanation for her inconsistent statements to the police and then
    tested her version of events in a number of ways including the extent to which
    it was corroborated by the testimony of others.  He chose to accept that she said nothing happened, not because it was
    true, but because she did not want to involve the police.  She wasnt satisfied in her own mind that she
    wanted to put herself and Justin Bisson through this ordeal, she did not know
    what to do so she was trying to do nothing.  He went on to say that the complainants explanation for the apparent
    inconsistency makes sense.  It fits
    with a reasonable understanding of human nature; she was conflicted not over
    what happened, but what to do about it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As for the
    credibility of her version of events, the trial judge had this to say: Her
    explanation, her account fits with all of the surrounding testimony.  In large measure it fits with Justin Bissons
    testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As can be seen, in assessing whether the Crown had
    proven lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge first addressed
    why the complainant changed her story  thereby rejecting the most significant challenge
    to her credibility &#8722; and then considered whether her testimony before the
    court was supported by other evidence.  In
    the end he accepted the complainants evidence as credible, as he was entitled,
    based on a reasonable understanding of human nature and the consistency of
    her testimony with respect to the totality of the evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i><span

lang=EN-US>The trial judge was unable to make a finding as to whether
    intercourse had taken place</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant argued that because the trial
    judge did not make a finding about whether penile penetration took place, he
    must have had a reasonable doubt as to whose version of events was true.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge stated as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>See, its my responsibility in a trial to make
    findings of fact.  Findings that are
    ultimately grounded on what I must determine is reliable evidence.  So in this case it is not that there wasnt
    penetration; and it is not that Ive found that there was penetration; it is
    simply an area where at the end of the day, as I tried to express in my reasons
    for conviction, I was left unable to make a determination.  But, what I did clearly find and did clearly
    try to express to Mr. Bisson, [the complainant] and the community, was that she
    was betrayed by a person in whom she reposed trust and confidence.  That she was betrayed, physically attacked
    and abused by Justin Bisson for his sexual gratification.  To use Mr. Bissons own words: He forced
    himself on her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judges inability to resolve this issue, the
    appellant argues, indicates indecision on his part as to whether the
    complainant was exaggerating or lying when she claimed to have been raped
    twice  an indecision that must lead to a reasonable doubt about other aspects
    of her story, including consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   I do not
    accept this submission. In my opinion, the trial judges inability to resolve
    this issue is not fatal to the conviction.  As the summary conviction appeal judge put it, A trial judge is
    entitled to accept all, some, or none of a witnesss evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge had cautioned himself regarding the
    application of <i>R. v. W.D. </i>(1991), 63
    C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), and made clear that he would be mindful that the
    existence of problematic areas ... demands that the court consider the need for
    confirmatory evidence before charging ahead into the mistake of balancing the
    evidence of the complainant against that of the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the trial judge, there was ample reliable
    evidence capable of confirming the complainants testimony that a non-consensual
    sexual encounter had occurred  the complainants behaviour immediately after
    the encounter, as evidenced by testimony of those who spoke to her and by the video
    of her leaving the appellants building, the conversations she had with the
    appellant, and of the appellants confession to Mr. Roberge.  As for penile penetration, there was not a
    similar wealth of confirmatory evidence.  The trial judge was aware of that.  He was also aware of the fact that he did not need to resolve that issue
    in order to convict the appellant of sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the fact that the trial judge found himself
    unable to determine whether penile penetration had taken place does not undermine
    his essential finding that the sexual activity that did take place was
    non-consensual.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge did not err in the use he
    made of the complainants out-of-court statements, so while the summary
    conviction appeal judge did err in resorting to the proviso on his own
    initiative, the error was of no moment because there was no underlying error to
    correct.   Further, I see no merit in any
    other grounds raised on appeal, including the manner in which the trial judge
    dealt with the issue of penile penetration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
