  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a four week trial, the appellants, Valcom Limited
    (Valcom), Brian Lewis (Lewis) and Gregory Poulin (Poulin), were found liable to
    both respondents and ordered to pay significant damages. The trial judge
    concluded that all three appellants were jointly and severally liable for
    defamation of the respondent Ms. Alleslev-Krofchak (AK), and for intentionally
    interfering with her economic relations.  The appellants Poulin and Valcom were held jointly and severally liable
    to the respondent Temagami Outfitting Company Canada Inc. (Temagami) for
    intentionally interfering with its economic relations and for inducing breach
    of contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellants raise six issues, focusing
    mainly on the trial judge’s treatment of the torts of intentional interference
    with economic relations and inducing breach of contract. Although I agree with
    the ultimate conclusions of the trial judge, my reasons differ somewhat from
    hers.  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s findings of fact occupy some
    sixty-seven pages.  The following is a
    brief summary, sufficient to set the broad context for her disposition of the
    issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the late 1990s, the federal Department of National
    Defence (DND) decided to change the basis upon which it contracted out the
    maintenance of its air fleet from contracts for time and materials to
    performance-based contracts which would specify what DND required, and the
    overall price, and leave it to the contractor to deliver as it saw fit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>AK left the Canadian Forces in 1996 and, for the next
    seven years, worked predominantly as a consultant to DND.  She was recognized as a leader in managing
    change to performance-based contracting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Temagami was started when AK retired from the
    military.  She and her husband were equal
    shareholders. All the services she provided that are relevant to this litigation
    were contracted through Temagami.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Valcom was a consulting company whose
    business was to contract with the federal government to provide it with the
    services of engineers and other consultants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Poulin was a manager at Valcom
    responsible for its aerospace contracts, including the one at issue in this
    litigation. That contract, which Valcom was awarded in May 2002, was for the
    provision of professional services to assist DND to move to its new method of
    contracting for the servicing of its air fleet.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contract resulted from a Request for Proposals
    (RFP) issued on behalf of DND in January 2002. The RFP required that the
    successful bidder have experience with the new method of contracting. Because
    of AK’s expertise, Valcom retained her services to assist with the preparation
    of its bid in response to the RFP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Valcom had no experience with performance-based
    contracting in the aerospace industry. However, AK facilitated an arrangement between
    Valcom and ARINC, a much larger American company that had been involved for
    years with US military contracts of this kind. Valcom and ARINC entered into an
    agreement pursuant to which Valcom would be the prime contractor with DND and
    ARINC would be Valcom’s subcontractor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of its bid, Valcom submitted AK’s name as the
    project manager of the contract (the SPM#1).  At AK’s insistence, her services were to be
    provided to the project by ARINC pursuant to its subcontract with Valcom, not
    directly as a Valcom resource.  This
    reflected the fact that ARINC had advised her that it would like to have a
    corporate office in Canada, and that there would be an opportunity for her in
    the future to help it develop its capability in the Canadian aerospace sector. Thus,
    when the Valcom bid succeeded, ARINC entered into a subcontract with Temagami
    for the services of AK. However, because AK’s involvement as an ARINC resource
    would have resulted in ARINC providing more resources to the project than were
    contemplated by its own subcontract with Valcom, it agreed that AK would initially
    assume the SPM#1 position as a Valcom resource, but only until her second in
    command (the SPM#2) was hired. In the main, therefore, AK’s work on the project
    was to be as an ARINC resource, not a Valcom resource.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This way of supplying AK’s services to the project left
    Valcom and Poulin frustrated and angry, but they needed both ARINC and AK to
    win the bid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Lewis was recruited by Valcom to serve as
    the SPM#2 and began work on July 21, 2003 as an employee of Valcom.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The events central to this litigation began to come to
    a head on August 11, 2003, when Poulin directed ARINC to remove AK from the
    project.  He asserted that there was serious
    concern about potential departures of project staff because of dissatisfaction
    with her management approach – a claim that the trial judge ultimately concluded
    was without foundation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When ARINC refused to remove her, given the absence of
    any evidence of her deficiencies, on August 13 Poulin purported to suspend the
    Valcom/ARINC subcontract and locked AK out of the project.  On August 25, Lewis took over as the acting
    SPM#1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ARINC considered a number of Valcom’s actions to be
    rash and unprofessional, including e-mails about AK circulated by Poulin and
    Lewis that the trial judge determined to be defamatory, and Valcom’s peremptory
    actions on August 13.  ARINC was
    concerned that its efforts to develop a relationship with DND could be
    negatively impacted as a consequence.  It
    immediately began to consider how to extricate itself from its relationship
    with Valcom and, in due course, terminated its subcontract with Valcom.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following her termination as SPM#1, AK never again
    obtained military or aerospace consulting work.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S DISPOSITION OF THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After dealing with the facts, the trial judge addressed
    the claims advanced by the respondents, specfically the torts of defamation,
    intentional interference with economic relations and inducing breach of
    contract.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Defamation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the statement of claim, three e-mails were
    particularized as defaming AK. The first was sent by Lewis to Poulin on July
    27, 2003, and subsequently forwarded by Poulin to ARINC and others at Valcom.
    The second and third were sent by Poulin to ARINC on August 11 and 12, 2003.  These e-mails asserted that AK had lied to
    Lewis, lacked integrity, was not trustworthy and was so lacking in management
    skills that some members of the project team would leave if she was not removed
    from the project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that all three e-mails were
    defamatory and could not be justified as being truthful. If qualified privilege
    applied, it was negated by malice on the part of Lewis and Poulin. The trial
    judge held that, since both were acting as employees of Valcom, all three
    appellants were liable for the defamation, and were jointly and severally
    responsible for the resulting damage to AK’s reputation, which the trial judge
    assessed at $100,000.  She did not award
    damages for economic loss for this tort, finding that the loss of income AK
    suffered from being peremptorily terminated from the SPM#1 position was planned
    by Valcom before the e-mails were sent and, in that sense, was not caused by
    the defamation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the appellants do not contest the
    defamation findings. They challenge only the quantum of general damages assessed
    for lost reputation due to the defamation.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Intentional interference with
    economic relations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to the claim for
    intentional interference with economic relations. She found that all three
    appellants intended their actions to result in AK being removed from the
    project as SPM#1, thereby causing her injury. The trial judge concluded that,
    since Poulin and Valcom knew AK contracted her services to ARINC through Temagami,
    they also intended their actions to cause Temagami economic loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge found no evidence that Lewis
    knew Temagami existed, and thus there was no evidence to support the conclusion
    that he intended to cause it economic loss.  The trial judge therefore dismissed Temagami’s claim against Lewis for
    intentional interference with economic relations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then addressed the requirement that the
    interference be by unlawful means. She identified three that were applicable on
    the facts: defamation, conspiracy, and breach of contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defamation identified by the trial judge as
    unlawful means included the three e-mails referred to earlier, but also
    Poulin’s e-mail to ARINC and others at Valcom dated June 20, 2003, and his
    letter to the federal government explaining Valcom’s actions in terminating AK
    from the project, dated September 23, 2003. As with the three other e-mails, the
    trial judge found these two communications to be defamatory of AK, untruthful,
    and motivated by malice. She held that all these defamatory statements resulted
    in ARINC terminating its subcontract with Valcom because it did not want to
    continue dealing with a company that handled itself in such an unprofessional
    manner, and that this severely interfered with AK’s livelihood. She therefore
    concluded that all three appellants interfered with AK’s economic relations by
    means of their defamatory statements and that Poulin and Valcom did the same to
    Temagami’s business by defaming its principal, AK.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found the unlawful means
    requirement to be satisfied by the tort of conspiracy. She concluded that there
    was an agreement among Poulin, Valcom and Lewis to defame AK in order to
    achieve their goal of getting rid of her. All three knew that this would cause
    her injury and would likely cause ARINC to withdraw from the project, thereby
    thwarting its plans to expand into the Canadian aerospace market and become a
    competitor for Valcom. The trial judge concluded that all three appellants
    interfered with AK’s livelihood through this conspiracy, and that Poulin and
    Valcom did the same to Temagami on that basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge relied on breach of contract
    as unlawful means. In particular, she found that Valcom breached the ARINC
    subcontract by purporting to suspend that contract on August 13, 2003, and by
    subsequently locking AK, an ARINC resource, out of the project site. This
    breach contributed to the economic loss suffered by AK and Temagami. The trial
    judge also found these actions by Valcom to be a breach of Valcom’s primary
    contract with DND and held that this breach provided additional support for her
    conclusion that Valcom used unlawful means to intentionally interfere with the
    business or livelihood of AK and Temagami.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For this tort, the trial judge assessed the general
    damages for injury to reputation, self-esteem and feelings at $100,000. She
    declined to award general damages to Temagami, concluding that the evidence did
    not establish that it had a reputation in the Canadian aerospace sector
    distinct from the reputation of AK. However, she found that both AK and Temagami
    suffered economic loss due to this intentional interference with their economic
    relations and set out the principles upon which damages for this loss should be
    calculated. Counsel were then able to agree on quantum: $129,504.27 inclusive
    of prejudgement interest in favour of AK, and $373,552.00 inclusive of
    prejudgment interest in favour of Temagami. All three appellants were jointly
    and severally liable to AK, while only Poulin and Valcom were jointly and
    severally liable to Temagami.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Inducing breach of contract</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge turned to the tort of inducing
    breach of contract. She found that Poulin and Valcom knew that ARINC and Temagami
    had a subcontract for the provision of AK’s services to the project. Moreover,
    she concluded that both these appellants knew that, by forcing ARINC to keep AK
    away from the project and cease her role as the SPM#1, ARINC would be in breach
    of its subcontract with Temagami and that they intended this result. She held
    that their conduct in locking AK out of the project not only put ARINC in
    breach of its contractual obligation to Temagami, but also had the effect of
    frustrating the performance of that subcontract. She declined to award general
    damages to Temagami for want of evidence that it had suffered any such loss.
    But she assessed Temagami’s economic loss due to this conduct on the same basis
    as for its economic loss due to the intentional interference tort. Thus, the
    $373,552 for which Valcom and Poulin were held jointly and severally liable to Temagami
    was founded on both intentional interference with economic relations and
    inducing breach of contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Save for the finding of defamation, the appellants appeal
    from all these findings.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise six arguments, the first four of

    only three acts of defamation were particularized in the statement of claim, that
    was in the context of pleading defamation as a separate cause of action. However,
    the statement of claim also pleaded “a variety of defamatory statements” made
    by the appellants, not as seperate causes of action to which the strict
    specific pleading requirement would apply, but as unlawful means for the
    purposes of the intentional interference tort. The appellants did not seek
    particulars of this allegation, and the two additional acts of defamation were
    the subject of considerable evidence at trial. In these circumstances, no
    injustice was caused by not pleading the particulars of these two acts of
    defamation, as would have been required had they been advanced as separate
    causes of action. In my view, where the pleadings do not impair a fair trial,
    there is no need to extend the highly structured code for pleading defamation
    as a separate cause of action to a circumstance such as this.</span></p>

    pattern of conduct by the three appellants to remove AK as the SPM#1. The claim
    asserted that the defamatory statements they made about her were for the
    purpose of interfering with her economic relations. This is, in essence, what
    the trial judge ultimately found: an agreement between the appellants to defame
    AK in order to achieve their goal of getting rid of her.</span></p>

    supplied through a contract between Valcom and Temagami. Poulin and Valcom were
    clearly aware of this. When this changed, and AK became an ARINC resource to
    the project, it was entirely open to the trial judge, even without direct

    economic loss as a result?  She found

    and intentional interference with economic relations. Its express purpose was

    of both torts. In <i>Correia, </i>this court
    described <i>OBG</i> this way at para. 97:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    OBG, the House of Lords determined to clarify and specifically define the elements
    of each tort. In doing so, the Lords corrected and, where necessary, overruled
    formerly precedential cases that, in hindsight, had introduced confusion and
    error into the definition of the two torts. The result is a clear definition of
    the two torts and their elements. The Lords were unanimous in all aspects of
    their definition of the two torts except one – Lord Nicholls disagreed on the
    scope of the concept of “unlawful means” in the tort of intentionally causing
    loss by unlawful interference with economic relations.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Apart
    from the debate about the scope of “unlawful means”, the Lords agreed that
    intentional interference with economic relations requires that the defendant
    intend to cause loss to the plaintiff, either as an end in itself or as a means
    of, for example, enriching himself. If the loss suffered by the plaintiff is
    merely a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s actions, that is not
    enough. Moreover, there must be a causal connection between the unlawful means
    and the loss suffered by the plaintiff. Neither of these components are new to
    the jurisprudence in Ontario. In <i>Lineal</i>,<i> </i>for example, the absence of an intention
    to harm the plaintiff was fatal to the successful assertion of the tort. Both of
    these components were addressed by the trial judge in this case.</span></p>

    Hoffmann began his discussion at para. 46, by adopting Lord Lindley’s rationale
    for the tort as being, in Lord Nicholls phrase describing his position, the
    defendants seeking to harm the plaintiff’s business “through the
    instrumentality of a third party”:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    rationale of the tort was described by Lord Lindley in <i>Quinn v. Leathem</i> [1901] AC 495, 534-535:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>“a person’s liberty or right to deal with others is nugatory, unless
    they are at liberty to deal with him if they choose to do so. Any interference
    with their liberty to deal with him affects him. If such interference is
    wrongful, the only person who can sue in respect of it is, as a rule, the
    person immediately affected by it; another who suffers by it has usually no
    redress; the damage to him is too remote, and it would be obviously practically
    impossible and highly inconvenient to give legal redress to all who suffer from
    such wrongs. <u>But if the interference is wrongful and is intended to damage a
    third person, and he is damaged in fact – in other words, if he is wrongfully
    and intentionally struck at through others, and is thereby damnified – the
    whole aspect of the case is changed:</u> the wrong done to others reaches him,
    his rights are infringed although indirectly, and damage to him is not remote
    or unforeseen, but is the direct consequence of what has been done.” [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He
    set out his view of the essence of the tort at para. 47:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    essence of the tort therefore appears to be (a) a wrongful interference with
    the actions of a third party in which the claimant has an economic interest and
    (b) an intention thereby to cause loss to the claimant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Then,
    critically for the appellant’s argument, Lord Hoffmann specified, at para. 49,
    that the tort must be actionable by the third party, subject to one exception:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    my opinion, and subject to one qualification, acts against a third party count
    as unlawful means only if they are actionable by that third party. The
    qualification is that they will also be unlawful means if the only reason why
    they are not actionable is because the third party has suffered no loss. In the
    case of intimidation, for example, the threat will usually give rise to no
    cause of action by the third party because he will have suffered no loss. If he
    submits to the threat, then, as the defendant intended, the claimant will have
    suffered loss instead. It is nevertheless unlawful means. But the threat must
    be to do something which <i>would</i> have
    been actionable if the third party had suffered loss.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, he offered this helpful summary definition of
    the tort at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unlawful means therefore consists of acts intended
    to cause loss to the claimant by interfering with the freedom of a third party
    in a way which is unlawful as against that third party and which is intended to
    cause loss to the claimant. It does not in my opinion include acts which may be
    unlawful against a third party but which do not affect his freedom to deal with
    the claimant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Nicholls’ contrasting view was, as this court
    described it at para. 103 of <i>Correia</i>,
    that “unlawful means” encompassed any conduct by the defendant that
    intentionally harmed the plaintiff and was in violation of an obligation under either
    civil or criminal law. Lord Nicholls did not consider actionability by the
    third party as a prerequisite. Although his opinion is less clear on this point,
    it appears that he also would not require the unlawful means to be directed at
    the third party, but would be satisfied if it were directed at the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this court has now opted for the Lord Hoffmann
    side of the debate. It did so expressly in <i>Correia</i>,
    relying on his statement of the elements of the tort, his definition of the
    tort, and his rationale for it, namely, to provide otherwise unavailable
    recovery for harm intentionally inflicted by  unlawful means through the instrumentality of
    a third party. See <i>Correia</i> at paras.
    99-103.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Correia</i>,
    the unlawful means alleged was the negligent investigation of the plaintiff by
    the defendant Aston.  Although the court
    found it unnecessary to fully define the scope of “unlawful means”, it
    dismissed the claim in part because the unlawful means were directly actionable
    by the plaintiff. The court said this at para. 107:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…Aston’s alleged negligence is directly actionable
    by the appellant, based on duty of care and foreseeability principles. There is
    no need to interpose the tort of intentional interference to obtain redress
    against Aston. The intentional torts exist to fill a gap where no action could
    otherwise be brought for intentional conduct that caused harm through the
    instrumentality of a third party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Hoffmann’s description of the essence of the
    intentional interference tort was also cited with approval by this court in <i>O’Dwyer v. Ontario (Racing Commission)</i> (2008),
    293 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 559.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, therefore, it is now clear that to qualify
    as “unlawful means”, the defendant’s actions (i) cannot be actionable directly
    by the plaintiff and (ii) must be directed at a third party, which then becomes
    the vehicle through which harm is caused to the plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not inconsistent with the three earlier cases from
    this court referred to above, all of which involved defendant actions directed
    at a third party for which the plaintiff could not sue the defendant directly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only contrary suggestion is by way of obiter in <i>Drouillard</i>, where defamation (presumably
    by the defendant of the plaintiff) was postulated as satisfying the unlawful
    means requirement. However this was clearly not necessary to the decision in
    that case. Moreover, at that time this court did not have the benefit of the
    detailed debate in <i>OBG</i>. As I have
    described, any suggestion that the tort might apply where the conduct is
    directly actionable by the plaintiff has been displaced by subsequent
    jurisprudence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like the court in <i>Correia</i>,
    I would say that there may be aspects of the concept of “unlawful means” yet to
    be fully defined. In particular, the extent of actionability by the third party,
    or whether, as Lord Hoffmann suggests, this requirement is subject to any
    qualifications, need not be fully defined in this case. The unlawful means
    relied on by the third party - defamation, conspiracy and breach of contract - are
    all clearly actionable under private law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying this analysis to the appellants’ argument, it
    is apparent that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellants’ five acts
    of defamation against AK could satisfy the unlawful means requirement for the
    tort of intentional interference with economic relations. These claims were all
    directly actionable by AK based on the tort of defamation. Indeed, she did so
    successfully in respect of three of the acts of defamation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant’s argument that, for the same
    reason, AK cannot rely on conspiracy as unlawful means requires a more detailed
    analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found a civil conspiracy involving
    Poulin, Valcom and Lewis. She concluded that they reached an agreement, which
    they then executed, to defame AK in order to achieve their goal of getting rid
    of her, thereby causing her harm. Although the trial judge was unable to find
    that the predominant purpose of this agreement was to injure AK, that was one
    of its purposes. Since it succeeded by using the unlawful means of defaming her,
    this constituted the actionable tort of conspiracy using unlawful means.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants accept this finding, but argue that this
    conspiracy cannot serve as the unlawful means necessary to allow AK to
    establish the intentional interference tort because AK could have sued directly
    for this conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons I have given concerning defamation as
    unlawful means, I agree with this argument insofar as it relates to the
    conspiracy to harm AK.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not the end of the matter, however. An
    actionable conspiracy exists if the defendants combine to act unlawfully, their
    conduct is directed towards the plaintiff (or the plaintiff and others) and the
    likelihood of injury to the plaintiff is known to the defendants or should have
    been known: see <i>Hunt v. Carey Canada
    Inc.,</i> [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959 at pp. 985-86. In this case, the appellants acted
    unlawfully by defaming AK, an ARINC resource. The trial judge found that the
    appellants recognized the consequences of their actions – the destruction of
    AK’s reputation in the Canadian military aerospace community – would
    effectively undermine ARINC’s involvement in the project and prevent it from
    becoming a competitor in the Canadian aerospace market. The respondents argue
    that this constitutes a conspiracy against ARINC and that this conspiracy can
    be properly used by AK to meet the unlawful means requirement needed to
    establish the intentional interference tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the agreement between
    Poulin, Valcom, and Lewis was intended to harm AK, but that the appellants were
    also aware that their actions would likely harm ARINC by undermining its role
    in the project and thwarting its expansion into the Canadian aerospace market,
    using AK’s excellent connections and credibility. She found that the appellants
    recognized that their success in defaming AK and peremptorily removing her as
    the SPM#1 of the project would result in ARINC’s withdrawal. This is exactly
    what transpired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These findings are amply supported by the evidence and
    are not contested. They constitute the tort of “unlawful means” conspiracy
    against ARINC. The unlawful means was the defamation of AK. It was directed by
    the appellants at ARINC through AK, an ARINC resource, with knowledge that
    ARINC would be harmed as a result. That is sufficient for the “unlawful means”
    conspiracy against ARINC. The unlawful means need not be directly actionable by
    ARINC, provided the means were directed at ARINC, as was the case here: see <i>Total Network SL v. Her Majesty’s Revenue
    and Customs,</i> [2008], U.K.H.L. 19 at para. 104.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conspiracy to harm ARINC would obviously be
    actionable by ARINC, but not by AK. It caused ARINC to terminate its
    relationship with Valcom on this project, and curtailed its expansion plans in
    Canada, actions in which AK had an economic interest and which harmed her. In
    my view, therefore, this conspiracy can properly serve as the unlawful means
    required for AK to establish the intentional interference tort against Poulin,
    Valcom and Lewis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ultimately concluded that conspiracy by
    the appellants met the “unlawful means” requirement to permit AK to recover for
    this tort. While much of her discussion concerned the conspiracy as it intended
    to harm AK, the trial judge described in some detail the plan both as it
    targeted AK and as it affected ARINC.  In
    my view, while the plan targeting AK cannot serve as the unlawful means permitting
    AK to recover, the plan’s harmful impact on ARINC is sufficient to ground a
    separate conspiracy that does so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, while I do so for rather different reasons
    than did the trial judge, I would dismiss the appellants’ argument that
    conspiracy cannot serve as unlawful means to permit AK to recover from Poulin
    and Lewis for the intentional interference with her economic relations. While
    AK cannot recover against these appellants based on defamation as unlawful
    means, it can do so on the basis of the unlawful means of conspiracy against
    ARINC.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It

    they say that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellants knew of the
    Temagami/ARINC contract and knew that their actions would cause ARINC to breach
    that contract. I do not agree. These are findings of fact that were open to the
    trial judge on the record. The appellants knew how AK’s services had been
    supplied to the project as a Valcom resource and could easily infer that the
    same arrangement would be used when those services were supplied to the project
    through ARINC. And, since the fundamental purpose of the Temagami/ARINC arrangement
    was to provide AK to the project as the SPM#1, it was not unreasonable to
    conclude that these appellants knew that by forcing ARINC to stop doing so,
    ARINC would be put in breach of its contract with Temagami. The trial judge
    could properly conclude that the appellants knew this about the contract whether
    or not they knew all of its precise terms.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the appellants argue that the trial judge erred in finding that they intended
    that ARINC breach its contract with Temagami. However, this too is a finding of
    fact that was open to the trial judge on the evidence. Poulin and Valcom
    deliberately required AK to immediately stop working as the SPM#1, barred her
    from the project, and purported to immediately suspend Valcom’s contract with
    ARINC. They did so knowing that ARINC would have to immediately cease having AK
    supply her services to the project, and knowing that it had no cause for doing
    so. This was contrary to ARINC’s contract with Temagami. The trial judge
    properly found that the appellants intended the natural consequences of these
    actions.</span></p>

    is also no basis for the appellants to argue that there was no actual breach by
    ARINC of its contract with Temagami. By precipitously suspending Valcom’s
    contract with ARINC through which AK’s services were supplied, as well as locking
    her out of the project, Poulin and Valcom forced ARINC to remove AK from the
    project, without notice, contrary to its contractual obligation to Temagami.</span></p>

    I agree with the appellants that the trial judge erred in finding that frustrating

    there be an actual breach.</span></p>

    at one time the jurisprudence may have been ambiguous on this point (see <i>Drouillard </i>at para. 34), <i>OBG</i> and <i>Correia</i> have brought clarity to the elements of this tort. In <i>OBG</i>, the House of Lords unanimously held
    that the tort of inducing breach of contract requires an actual breach. Lord
    Hoffmann stated this proposition with simple and stark clarity at para. 44: “…I

    breach.”</span></p>

    Nicholls made the same point in his speech. He explained that the underlying
    rationale for the inducement tort is that the one who procures the wrong - in
    this case, the breach of contract - ought to be held responsible, along with
    the one who actually commits the wrong. But there must be a wrong committed.
    Lord Nicholls put it this way at para. 172:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>With
    the inducement tort the defendant is responsible for the third party’s breach
    of contract which he procured. In that circumstance this tort provides a
    claimant with an additional cause of action. The third party who breached his
    contract is liable for breach of contract. The person who persuaded him to break
    his contract is also liable, in his case in tort. Hence this tort is an example
    of civil liability which is secondary in the sense that it is secondary, or
    supplemental, to that of the third party who committed a breach of his
    contract. It is a form of accessory liability.</span></p>

    the defendant ought to be liable to the plaintiff as an accessory to the

    That is the role of the inducement tort. If the third party does not breach a
    contract with the plaintiff, but instead interferes with the plaintiff’s
    economic relations as a result of unlawful means used by the defendant against
    that third party, the defendant ought to be liable to the plaintiff because

    without the use of otherwise unlawful means and without inducing the third
    party to actually breach that contract, the court is not well placed to

    of the appellants that fell short of causing an actual breach of ARINC’s
    contract with Temagami. However, since she also found that the appellants
    caused ARINC to actually breach that contract, and since I would dismiss the
    appellants’ other arguments on this issue, I would uphold the trial judge’s
    ultimate conclusion that Temagami established all the required elements of the

    reputation and self-esteem caused by her peremptory removal from the SPM#1
    position and being locked out of the project. The trial judge found that this
    harmed her in the small Canadian aerospace community independent of whether

lang=EN-US>They say that the trial judge erred
    in awarding economic loss damages to AK for what were, in effect, Temagami’s
    economic losses. I disagree. The trial judge was careful not to duplicate
    awards. Temagami recovered for the period September 2003 to May 2005, when the
    trial judge found AK would likely have moved on to become directly employed by
    ARINC. AK was not awarded economic loss damages for that period. Beyond that
    date, AK recovered for what she would have received from ARINC. Temagami did
    not recover for anything beyond May 2005. There was no duplication.</span></p>

    should not have recovered up to May 2007 because Valcom would have lawfully
    terminated her from the project well before then. However the trial judge’s
    award of economic loss damages to AK up until May 2007 was not based on her
    continuing service on the project until that date, but on the finding that she
    would have been working at ARINC on other projects until that date. This
    argument must be rejected.</span></p>

    Temagami’s award for economic loss insufficiently reflects reductions for
    contingencies. This is the only attack made on this award in favour of
    Temagami. In my view it also fails. Reductions for contingencies are necessarily
    case-specific and their calculation is very much an exercise of judicial
    discretion. The appellants point to no error in principle by the trial judge
