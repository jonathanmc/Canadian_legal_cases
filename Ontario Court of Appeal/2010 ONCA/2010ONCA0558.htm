  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant applies for bail pending her appeal.  She was convicted of aggravated assault
    endangering life, by giving her son a potentially lethal dose of cocaine;
    administering cocaine to him over a 14 month period; assault causing bodily
    harm, resulting in multiple rib fractures; and failing to provide necessaries
    of life by failing to seek medical assistance for his fractured arm.  The applicant was sentenced on July 8, 2010
    to a period of five years and ten months imprisonment in addition to credit for
    14 months pre-trial custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the appeal is not frivolous,
    and does not dispute that the applicant will surrender herself into custody in
    accordance with the terms of any judicial interim release order made pending
    appeal.  In addition, the applicant, a 26
    year old first offender, submits that she has employment available to her if she
    is released pending her appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in this case is whether the applicant has
    established that her detention is not necessary in the public interest.  The public interest relates to the need to
    maintain confidence in the administration of justice by enforcing the judgment
    balanced against the need to review the judgment to ensure that no person has
    been wrongly or unfairly convicted.  Appellate courts have recognized that, where the grounds of appeal are
    strong and there is serious concern about the accuracy of the verdict, the
    public interest may favour release notwithstanding the seriousness of the
    offences involved: <i>See R. v. Baltovich </i>(2000),
    144 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 20.  As a result, the strength of the grounds of appeal is central to my
    decision whether or not to grant the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the material before me, including the
    comprehensive reasons of the trial judge for her verdict as well as on the
    motion to declare a mistrial, the grounds of appeal appear weak.  The overarching ground of appeal is that the
    appellant’s trial counsel, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kirichenko</span>, breached
    his duty of loyalty to his client and rendered ineffective assistance to her
    resulting in a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insofar as counsel’s duty of loyalty is concerned, the
    applicant testified on the mistrial application that in December of 2008, she
    gave him $1,000 in cash as a means of obtaining a meeting with him.  Mr. Kirichenko, who was on a legal aid
    certificate at the time and therefore prohibited from receiving a private
    retainer from the applicant, admits receiving money from her, says it was $300
    and that it was a Christmas present. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three days before the applicant’s trial was to
    commence, the Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC) held a disciplinary hearing
    into allegations that Mr. Kirichenko had failed to keep proper accounts and
    failed to respond to demands and spot audits from the LSUC.  Mr. Kirichenko conceded the allegations but
    requested an indefinite postponement of the penalty including a 30 day suspension
    of his license to practice.  The Chair
    refused the request for an indefinite postponement but postponed the
    commencement of the suspension until February 23, 2009 to accommodate the
    appellant’s trial.  In the event it was
    necessary, the Chair advised Mr. Kirichenko he could request a further extension
    of time in writing.  Mr. Kirichenko did
    not request an extension of time and further postponement of his
    suspension.  Thus, he began serving his
    suspension on February 23, 2009.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence and submissions in the applicant’s trial
    were completed on January 29, 2009 and the case was adjourned for judgment to
    March 25, 2009.  The day before judgment
    was to be handed <span class=GramE>down,</span> Mr. Kirichenko telephoned the
    applicant to say that the matter was going to be adjourned for one week.  He told her that he could not appear in court
    with her when the matter was adjourned because he was ill.  The following week, when judgment was handed
    down, on April 1, 2009, he sat beside her ungowned in the courtroom.  He lied and said that he had forgotten his
    robes at home.  In a hand written note to
    Ms. Phillips of the LSUC before the hearing, Mr. Kirichenko wrote, “Can I go
    get judgment tomorrow?  It was long
    trial; client with no record faces long term if convicted. Also press has been
    all over the case.  I would like to avoid
    explaining being ungowned.  If there is
    conviction it will be adjourned.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant submits that Mr. Kirichenko’s conduct
    fell well below the duty of loyalty required of a lawyer outlined by Binnie J.
    in <i>R. v. Neil, </i>[2002] 168 C.C.C.(3d)
    11 and that, as a result, she is entitled to a new trial.  She submits that she was entitled to be
    informed of Mr. Kirichenko’s circumstances because that information could have
    affected her decision as to whether to continue with him as her counsel.  In addition, Mr. Kirichenko apparently did
    not comply with the LSUC’s requirement that he cease to practice for one
    month.  He continued to provide the
    applicant with legal advice and spoke with her probation officer assisting in
    the preparation of the pre-sentence report.  Had the applicant wished to ask Mr. Kirichenko to have the court reopen
    the case and to reconsider its verdict, the applicant submits Mr. Kirichenko
    would not have been in a position to do so as he was under suspension during
    this <span class=GramE>time.</span>  I
    note, however, that after March 23, he would have served his suspension and
    been in a position to bring such an application as the sentence was not
    pronounced until July 8, 2010.  No such
    application was made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While Mr. Kirichenko’s conduct may well be the subject
    of further discipline proceedings before the LSUC, the LSUC allowed him to
    continue to act and postponed his suspension so that he could act for the
    applicant.  It did not require him to
    advise the applicant of his pending suspension.  In doing so, it is apparent that the LSUC did
    not see a conflict of interest, a breach of Mr. Kirichenko’s duty of loyalty to
    his client, or any danger to her interests. Insofar as the receipt of money in
    December is concerned, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kirichenko</span> may have
    wrongly accepted money from the applicant and, in doing so, put his
    self-interest first, but the acceptance of the money did not create a conflict
    in<i> </i>the proceeding brought by the
    Crown. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The applicant
    also alleges that Mr. Kirichenko’s upcoming suspension improperly influenced
    his conduct of the appellant’s trial and caused him to cut corners in order to
    complete the trial as soon as possible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dunnet J. dealt with these arguments in her
    comprehensive reasons on the motion for a mistrial. At this stage, I am not
    satisfied that counsel has shown any error in principle in the manner in which
    she exercised her discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial and in rejecting
    the submission that Mr. Kirichenko’s conduct led to a miscarriage of justice.  As a result, those reasons are entitled to
    deference.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some further brief comment is warranted concerning the
    applicant’s submissions that Mr. Kirichenko was obliged to raise the prior
    misconduct of two expert witnesses in matters that were unrelated to this
    proceeding with a view to undermining their credibility generally.  I note that the evidence of the one expert,
    Dr. Mian, relates to the conviction for assault causing bodily harm due to rib
    fractures but does not touch the trial judge’s findings concerning the
    appellant’s failure to seek medical attention for her son’s arm which led to
    her conviction for failing to provide the necessaries of life nor does it
    relate to her conviction for aggravated assault by endangering life by
    administering a noxious substance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant’s challenge to the evidence of Dr. Koren,
    the hair follicle expert, to the effect that M. had been given cocaine over a
    14 month period, loses a considerable amount of its thrust due to the fact that
    during the preliminary inquiry Mr. Gareri, the Manager of the Division of
    Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Motherisk Laboratory, gave the same
    evidence.  I do not take the applicant’s
    submission to go so far as to suggest that the evidence of anyone who works at
    the Motherisk Laboratory is not credible because of some past misconduct on the
    part of its owner Dr. Koren.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extremely serious nature of the conviction in this
    case, endangering the life of a two year old child by the administration of a
    potentially lethal dose of cocaine with the tragic consequence that he is now
    severely disabled, coupled with what appear at this time to be weak grounds of
    appeal, lead me to conclude that the need for enforceability of the judgment
    must be given precedence at this time.  The appellant has failed to discharge the onus on her respecting the
    public interest criterion. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also observe that, if properly processed, the
    appellant’s continued incarceration would not render her appeal nugatory.  The trial was not unduly lengthy.  The applicant’s counsel has ordered the trial
    transcripts.  Priority should be given to
    their preparation and to the scheduling of this appeal in as expeditious a
    manner as is possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given the application for bail pending
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
