lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The arbitrator summarized the
    facts, noting that the ING contact information was in the chiropractor’s file
    and that the Forms provided the names and addresses of each of the claimants,
    along with a brief description of the nature of the injuries each had sustained
    in the accident.  He then set out the
    relevant legislative provisions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Next, the arbitrator considered
    the governing legal principles.  He
    stated that it is settled law that a person need not provide a formal
    application to an insurance company to be deemed to have provided a completed application
    for accident benefits.  Relying on <i>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Commerce
    Insurance Co. </i>(2001), 36 C.C.L.I. (3d) 269 (Ont. S.C.), he opined that a person
    need only provide sufficient particulars to an insurance company so as to
    reasonably assist the insurer with the processing of the application and the
    assessment of the claim.  Accordingly, the
    arbitrator viewed the real question to be whether the Forms “contained
    sufficient particulars to reasonably assist [ING] with the processing of the
    application and the assessment of the claim and whether ING took reasonable
    steps to obtain the necessary information from the information provided to [it].”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The arbitrator concluded that
    the Forms met this test.  In reaching
    this conclusion, he referred to several pieces of evidence from which the
    natural inference could be drawn that proper contact with one of the claimants
    would likely have provided timely contact information for all of them.  Further, he found that had ING sent letters
    to the correct addresses for the <span class=SpellE>Aranciabias</span> or had
    it reasonably followed up with <span class=SpellE>Gema</span> <span
class=SpellE>Aranciabia</span> once it had her cell phone number, it would have
    obtained sufficient contact information to enable it to process the claims.  He observed that ING knew that <span
class=SpellE>Gema</span> <span class=SpellE>Aranciabia</span> was a student and
    may not have had her phone activated during business hours and that there was
    no evidence that ING attempted to contact her outside of normal school hours.  Moreover, ING made no attempt to personally
    contact any of the claimants at the addresses shown on the Forms.  Documentation indicated that the <span
class=SpellE>Aranciabias</span> continued to reside at the Queens Drive address
    throughout the relevant period.   </span></p>

    “pay now, dispute later” policy informing the [statutory benefits] regime.  The reasoning of <span class=SpellE>Lissaman</span> J. [in <i>Liberty Mutual</i>] fits as well with
    the current [statutory benefits] scheme as it did with the predecessor one.  The Regulation seeks to start [statutory
    benefits] flowing to entitled claimants as quickly as possible, without
    awaiting the resolution of priority disputes amongst insurers.  <i>Liberty
    Mutual</i>’s functional, rather than formal, approach to interpreting what
    constitutes a “completed application” to commence the payment of benefits
    supports the policy underlying the [statutory benefits] regime. </p>

    arbitrator was correct in accepting and applying the principle set out in <i>Liberty Mutual</i>.  The application judge noted that in applying
    that principle, the arbitrator made a key finding of fact: had ING sent the

    made better efforts to reach <span class=SpellE>Gema</span> <span class=SpellE>Aranciabia</span> by telephone, sufficient contact information would have been obtained which

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it is beyond debate
    that in this case, the standard of review is that of correctness.  According to the reasons of the application
    judge, both parties agreed that he was to apply a correctness standard of
    review to the arbitrator’s decision and it was that standard which he applied.  The order of the application judge comes before

    determine whether the application judge was correct in upholding the

lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would simply add that all of
    the arguments that TD makes in favour of the reasonableness standard of review relate
    to a review of arbitrators’ decisions.  Accordingly, those are arguments that apply to the standard of review
    that the application judge was to apply when reviewing the arbitrator’s
    decision.  Had TD wished to make these
    arguments, they should have been made below.  As it stands, the application judge applied a correctness standard of
    review and, as no cross-appeal was taken on this matter, the propriety of the
    standard of review used by the application judge is not under scrutiny by this
    court.        </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS </span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ING’s position is essentially
    this.  It wrote to the claimants, asking
    them to send in completed application forms for benefits.  No such forms were ever received.  The claimants never communicated – and may
    never have had – an intention to assert a claim with ING.  In contrast, it is clear that the claimants
    intended to seek accident benefits from TD because they submitted completed
    OCF-1 forms to TD on October 10, 2007.  In the circumstances, ING submits it was an error for the arbitrator to have
    found that ING was the first insurer to receive a completed application for
    benefits and the application judge erred in refusing to overturn that decision.</span></p>

    judge, for the reasons that he gave, that the principle in <i>Liberty Mutual </i>applies.  Accordingly, an application for accident benefits need not be on a
    certain form in order to be valid – it need only provide sufficient particulars
    to reasonably assist the insurer with processing the application, identifying
    the benefits to which the applicant may be entitled, and assessing the claim:
    see paras. 41-42 of <i>Liberty Mutual</i>.  That is, the insurer only needs sufficient
    information to meaningfully move forward or commence the process of adjusting
    the claim: see <span class=SpellE><i>Andriano</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Wawanesa</span> Mutual Insurance Co.</i>, 2007 <span class=SpellE>CarswellOnt</span> 5669, at

    claimants.  The claimants had signed the
    Forms.  They obtained chiropractic
    treatment and gave the chiropractor information about ING.  This is evident from the fact that the Forms
    identified the ING claim and policy numbers.  The Forms also set out the treatment that had been provided and
    requested payment for the same.  </span><span
lang=EN-US>When the adjuster at ING received the Forms on May 30, 2007, she had
    sufficient information to assist her with commencing the processing of the
    applications and assessing the claims.  As discussed more fully below, the arbitrator was entitled to find that
    ING had failed to take reasonable steps to obtain the necessary further
    information from the claimants.  Consequently, I see no error in the application judge upholding the
    arbitrator’s determination that the Forms, in the circumstances of this case,
    amounted to completed applications for accident benefits.    </span></p>

    whether the information constituted a completed application and that ING’s information

    for the finding of the arbitrator, as the application judge stated, that finding
    was amply supported by the evidence and there is no reason to interfere with
    it.  That is, it was open to the
    arbitrator to find that contact with one claimant would have led to contact
    with the others and, had ING sent letters to the correct address for the <span

    Schedule which provides that a “person” shall notify the insurer of his or her
    intentions to apply for accident benefits.  It then points to the definition of an “insured person” in s. 2 of the
    Schedule, which does not expressly include a third party.  Consequently, ING contends, as a third party
    service provider is not an “insured person” nor is it necessarily the injured person’s
    agent, in the absence of evidence of any agency agreement between Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Komeilinejad</span> and the claimants, it cannot be said that Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Komeilinejad</span> notified ING of the claimants’ intention to
    apply for accident benefits.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This argument appears to be
    misconceived.  An insurer’s obligation arises
    if it is the first insurer to receive a completed application for accident
    benefits.  There is no requirement in the
    legislation that the completed application be submitted by the injured person
    and I see no reason for reading in such a requirement.  As the arbitrator noted, the claimant may be
    physically incapable of submitting the claim due to his or her injuries.  As well, one can conceive of language and
    disability challenges that might lead to someone other than the injured person
    submitting an application.  Given that there
    is no requirement that the completed application be submitted by the injured
    person him or herself, there was no need for the arbitrator or the application
    judge to have determined whether Dr. <span class=SpellE>Komeilinejad</span> was
    acting as agent for the claimants in sending in the Forms to ING.  Even if I am wrong on this matter, given that
    the claimants signed the Forms and gave the chiropractor ING’s information,
    including policy and claim numbers, as well as the date of the accident, it was
    open to the arbitrator to have found that the claimants intended to apply for
    accident benefits from ING and that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Komeilinejad</span> submitted the Forms on behalf of the claimants.    </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ING makes essentially two

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, it says that the goal of
    the Regulation is to ensure that insured persons are not left without benefits
    in the event of a priority dispute.  It
    submits that this goal is not served by broadening the concept of a “completed
    application for benefits” to include a single, stale-dated PAF treatment plan
    or invoice from a service provider in the absence of any indication that the injured
    person intended to pursue a claim for accident benefits.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, ING says that ambiguity
    and uncertainty about what constitutes a completed application for accident
    benefits renders it difficult for an insurer to comply with this court’s
    decision in <i>Kingsway General insurance
    Co. v. West <span class=SpellE>Wawanosh</span> Insurance </i>(2002), 58 O.R. (3d)
    251, in which it emphasized the importance of providing timely notice of a

lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept either of these
    submissions.  The goal of the Regulation
    is to “pay now, dispute later”.  By
    adopting a flexible – rather than a formalistic – approach to deciding what
    documents amount to a completed application for benefits, the courts have
    encouraged insurers to do just that.  Once an insurer has received sufficient information that it can obtain
    any further necessary information, it must obtain that additional information
    and begin to pay benefits.  This
    interpretation furthers the goal of “pay now” as the insurer cannot rely on
    shortcomings in written documentation as a ground for refusing to pay
    benefits.  Furthermore, in my view, there
    is nothing inconsistent with such an approach to this court’s admonition in <i>Kingsway General Insurance</i> that insurers
    must give timely notice of a priority dispute.  If an insurer takes steps to obtain any additional information that may
    be required to pay benefits and then pays such benefits, the insurer will have
    the opportunity to get the information necessary to give timely notice if it
    disputes its obligation to pay such benefits.      </span></p>

    OCF-1 form with ING.  Just under 90 days
    later, ING commenced a priority dispute with State Farm.  State Farm argued that the statement that ING
    had taken amounted to a completed application for the purposes of commencing
    the 90-day limitation period within which an insurer may dispute its obligation
    to pay benefits.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"

lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ING says that <i>ING v. State Farm </i>stands for the
    proposition that the claimants’ failure to submit OCF-1s to ING and their
    submission of such forms to TD makes it clear that TD was the first insurer to
    receive a completed application for accident benefits.  It submits that the decision in the present
    case is inconsistent with that rendered in <i>ING
    v. State Farm</i>.     <b>   </b></span></p>

lang=EN-US>ING v. State Farm</span></i><span lang=EN-US> can be distinguished
    from the present case on two factual bases.  First, the statement in <i>ING v.
    State Farms </i>did not notify ING of the claimant’s intention to apply for
    accident benefits nor did it include a request for the payment of benefits.  By way of contrast, in the present case each Form
    was signed by the claimant, sets out the treatment for that claimant and
    requests payment for those treatments.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, ING’s conduct in the
    two cases was very different.  In <i>ING v. State Farm</i> at p. 3, the
    arbitrator praised ING, saying that it displayed a “high caliber of claims
    handling which is appropriately responsible to notification of a claim”.  At p. 2, he said that: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ING’s course of conduct in [respect of the
    statement] is entirely appropriate, and indeed is to be encouraged.  They moved expeditiously to respond to a
    potential claim.  They have been thorough
    in their investigation.  They have been
    careful to deal with all of the rather complicated requirements of the
    insurance regime.  On December 5, 2006,
    they sent a letter to the claimant providing an accident benefits package of
    various documents and enclosing descriptions of the various benefits that would
    potentially be available to the claimant.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, however, the
    arbitrator was justifiably critical of ING.  As has already been noted, ING did not move expeditiously to respond to
    a potential claim nor was it thorough in its investigation.  After receiving the Forms, ING failed to take
    reasonable steps to obtain any additional information that it required.  It never sent letters to the <span
class=SpellE>Aranciabias</span>’ correct address.  It failed to reasonably follow up with <span
class=SpellE>Gema</span> <span class=SpellE>Aranciabia</span> by phone and it made
    no attempt to personally contact any of the claimants at the addresses shown on
    the Forms.  Further, ING did not
    carefully deal with the requirements of the insurance regime.  Section 32(2) of the Schedule requires an
    insurer to promptly provide a claimant with the appropriate application forms.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  ING failed to send the appropriate forms to
    the claimants in this case, whereas in <i>ING
    v. State Farms</i>, it did so promptly.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These factual differences fully
    explain the different results in the two cases, thus, I do not view them as inconsistent.  Moreover, it is significant that in <i>ING v. State Farm</i> at p. 6, the
    arbitrator opined that there might be circumstances relating to the conduct of
    the insurer that would justify holding the insurer as having received a
    completed application in the absence of receipt of the prescribed form.  He noted that in the case before him there
    was no documentation submitted in lieu of a form and there were no
    communications in which the claimant had, in writing, requested benefits.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The present case falls within
    the circumstances described by the arbitrator in <i>ING v. State Farm </i>as justifying a finding that the insurer had
    received a completed application form.  The Forms are written documents submitted in lieu of the OCF-1 form, in
    the sense that they were a request for the payment of benefits.  The claimants had each signed the Forms, thus,
    there were written request for benefits.  These facts, coupled with ING’s failure to take reasonable steps to
    obtain additional information, justify the arbitrator’s conclusion that ING received
    a completed application for accident benefits within the meaning of s. 2 of the
    Regulation.       </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While ING argues that the
    reasoning of Strathy J. in the appeal decision in <i>ING v. State Farm </i>supports its position, I disagree.  It is correct to say that Strathy J. indicated
    that the plain meaning of the words in s. 3(1) of the Regulation contemplated
    an OCF-1 form, however, he went on to say that there are cases –
    distinguishable from the one before him – in which an insurer that has not
    received a completed OCF-1 form should be treated as being the first insurer to
    have received a completed application for accident benefits.  He expressly referred to the decisions of the
    arbitrator and application judge in the present case as one such case: see
    para. 35.  <span class=GramE>At</span> para. 37, he described ING’s conduct in the present case as “unsatisfactory
    claims handling” that resulted “in prejudice or potential prejudice to the
    injured party”.  He went on to state that
    “The insurer was not permitted to avoid its responsibilities by sticking its
    head in the sand and hoping that the claim would disappear or that the claimant
    would pursue another insurer.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I share Strathy J.’s view,
    expressed at para. 44 of his reasons, that the interests of the insurance
    industry favour certainty in the meaning of a “completed application” as it <span
class=GramE>is</span> that which triggers the commencement of the limitation
    period.  However, I also agree with Strathy
    J. when he says that while normally a completed application will mean an application
    in the OCF-1 form, there will be those “relatively rare cases” in which because
    of “waiver, estoppel, delay or deflection”, an insurer who has not received an
    OCF-1 form is to be treated as the first insurer for the purposes of s. 2.  As I have already explained, the findings of
    the arbitrator, as affirmed on appeal in the present case, justify treating ING
    as the first insurer in the present case.  </span></p>
