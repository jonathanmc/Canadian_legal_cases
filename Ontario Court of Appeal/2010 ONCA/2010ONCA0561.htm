  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation and
    was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment.  The victim was the son of the appellant’s
    common law partner and was between age 15 and 17 at the time the offence was
    committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from conviction was abandoned.  The sole ground raised on the sentence appeal
    is based upon fresh evidence.  The
    proposed fresh evidence is that the appellant is now subject to a deportation
    order imposed as a result of his conviction and sentence.  Because the sentence was for more than two
    years, the appellant cannot appeal the deportation order to the Immigration
    Appeal Division: <i><span style='color:black'>Immigration and Refugee
    Protection Act</span></i>, 2001, c. 27. <span class=GramE>s</span>. 64(2).  Had the sentence been for less than two
    years, the appellant would have a right of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apparent from the record of the sentencing
    proceedings that neither the sentencing judge nor counsel was aware of the
    appellant’s immigration status or of the full impact of a penitentiary sentence
    upon the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s problem with his immigration status is
    unusual.  He came to Canada from Scotland
    as a 14 month-old infant.  Neither he nor
    his parents took any steps to become Canadian citizens.  The appellant is now 45 years old and has
    lived 44 of those years in Canada as if he were a Canadian.  He has no ties to Scotland apart from the fact
    that it is the place of his birth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge carefully considered the
    mitigating and aggravating factors. The appellant is a first-time offender and
    has a good employment history.  He pleaded
    guilty, expressed his remorse, was dealing with his problem with drugs and
    alcohol and he appeared to be a low risk to reoffend.  On the other hand, he was in a position of
    trust and authority over the victim and the offence was prolonged and included
    several acts of anal intercourse.  The
    Crown asked for a three year sentence while the appellant asked for a
    conditional sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When considering the plea for a conditional sentence,
    the sentencing judge concluded that he “could not exclude a penitentiary
    sentence” and that “even if [he] were to be persuaded that an appropriate range
    of sentence includes the reformatory” a custodial term was required.  Earlier, the sentencing judge observed that
    “even in the Crown’s view” the mitigating factors “take the sentence into the
    lowest part of the range…”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were it not for the fresh evidence as to the
    deportation order, I would not interfere with this sentence.  However, I do not agree with the submission of
    the Crown that a reformatory sentence was outside the acceptable range.  In my view, in the unusual circumstances of
    this case, the certainty of deportation is a factor that properly tips the
    scale in favour of a sentence of two years less a day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has held that “the certainty of deportation
    may justify some reduction in the term of imprisonment for purely pragmatic
    reasons”:  <i>R. v. Hamilton</i> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    156.  While the sentencing process should
    not be used to circumvent the provisions of the <i>Immigration and Refugee Act</i>, the calculation of the appropriate
    sentence is not an exact science.  Where
    there is a range of possible sentences, the fact that an offender will face
    deportation under one possibility “is<span style='color:black'> one of the
    factors which is to be taken into consideration…in conjunction with all of the
    other circumstances of the case”</span> in choosing the appropriate sentence
    and tailoring the sentence to fit the crime and the offender: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Melo</span></i> (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 510 at p. 516. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize that most cases in which an appellate court
    has reduced a sentence on account of the risk of deportation have involved
    modest reductions, often from two years to two years less a day.  However, when I assess the unusual
    circumstances of this offence and this offender with the benefit of knowing
    what has transpired since that sentence was <span class=GramE>imposed,</span> I
    conclude that a 30 months sentence is not fit and that the interests of justice
    would be served if the sentence were reduced to two years less a day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant is within less than two months of
    his statutory release date. This means that he has effectively served virtually
    all the custodial time imposed by the sentencing judge.  In practical terms, by reducing the sentence
    and adding a term of probation we do not significantly interfere with the
    practical effect of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant has led as fresh evidence reports
    from the institution indicating that he has made significant progress in
    custody, completing programs to assist sex offenders and those with problems of
    substance abuse. These reports indicate that the custodial authorities are
    satisfied that he presents a low risk of re-offending.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant has married his long-term partner
    who is a Canadian citizen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, it is now apparent that unless his sentence is
    reduced, he will almost certainly be deported from Canada to a country with
    which he has no meaningful connection. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing process must retain “a human face”.  <i>Hamilton</i>, <i>supra,</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    158; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Iamkhong</span> </i>2009 ONCA 478 at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 60.  Appellate courts appropriately exercise their
    powers in exceptional cases to avoid unintended penalties and consequences that
    would be patently unjust and unfair.  The
    cumulative effect of the factors I have mentioned makes this such a case.  The appellant has effectively served his time.
     It would be unfair and unjust to leave
    in place a sentence that would have the unintended effect of condemning the
    appellant to exile in a country with which he has no meaningful connection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed as
    abandoned. I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal, and reduce
    the custodial portion of the sentence to one of two years less a day, plus six
    months probation. </p>
