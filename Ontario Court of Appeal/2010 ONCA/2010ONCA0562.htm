  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two matters before this court:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A review of decisions of MacFarland J.A. in M37568 and
    M37577.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An appeal from the decision of Murray J. of December
    29, 2009.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This attempt to review the decision of MacFarland J.A.
    is misconceived.&nbsp; The appellant
    attempted to appeal the decision of Coats J. of March 13, 2007 made following a
    trial.&nbsp; On March 6, 2009 a panel of
    this court ordered that the appeal be stayed pending payment of $54,690.93,
    being arrears of spousal and child support and $15,000 of the outstanding final
    costs orders.&nbsp; The order provided
    that the appellant had 60 days to pay those amounts to the respondent,
    &#8220;failing which an order will go dismissing the appeal&#8221;.&nbsp; The appellant did not make the payments
    as ordered.&nbsp; Rather, he brought a motion
    returnable before a single judge on May 14, 2009 for an order staying his own
    appeal pending an application he had brought before the Superior Court of Justice
    to vary the order of Coats&nbsp;J.&nbsp; This motion came on before MacFarland J.A. who held as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By order of this court made March 6/09 Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Misheal</span> was ordered to pay certain monies within 60 days.&nbsp; He has not done so.&nbsp; Accordingly, by the terms of the March 6
    order his appeal is dismissed and his motion is also dismissed as there is no
    outstanding appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with MacFarland J.A.&nbsp; The appeal having been dismissed, there
    was no appeal to stay.&nbsp; Accordingly,
    the application to review her order is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal from Murray J.&#8217;s Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the latest in a number of proceedings taken by
    the appellant in an attempt to overturn or vary the support orders made by
    Coats J.&nbsp; See, for example, the
    decisions of this court at 2008 ONCA 674 and 2008 ONCA 832.&nbsp; The appellant submits that there has
    been a material change in circumstances, namely, that he has become so disabled
    that he is unable to work and therefore unable to make the support payments
    ordered by Coats&nbsp;J.&nbsp; The
    transcript shows that Murray J. made it clear during the hearing that he was
    not satisfied with the quality of the evidence the appellant relied upon to
    show that he was disabled.&nbsp; He gave
    the appellant several opportunities to adjourn the hearing so that he could get
    better evidence.&nbsp; The appellant
    refused those offers.&nbsp; It was open
    to the application judge to reject the evidence relied upon by the
    appellant.&nbsp; He explained why he
    considered the evidence suspect and unreliable both during the hearing and in
    his endorsement and, as we have said, Murray J. gave the appellant every
    opportunity to adjourn to obtain better information.&nbsp; We see no reversible error in the
    findings made by Murray J. based on the record before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has included in his appeal book a letter
    from a Dr. <span class=SpellE>Couban</span>, a letter from a Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Beveridge</span> and a report from a Dr. <span class=SpellE>Leckey</span>.&nbsp; He has also included a Physiotherapy
    Progress Report, various documents showing he attended for physiotherapy and a
    list of medications.&nbsp; There are a
    number of problems with this material.&nbsp; First, if this was intended to be fresh evidence, the procedure for
    adducing fresh evidence has not be followed and there is no affidavit that
    provides the information necessary to receive this material as fresh
    evidence.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the material is not admissible because it
    would not have affected the result of the application.&nbsp; The letter from Dr. <span class=SpellE>Couban</span> is merely an explanation that he hoped the clinic would be able to see the
    appellant in the next 12 months.&nbsp; The letter explains that priority is given to patients who are the most
    unwell and according to the information from the appellant&#8217;s physician
    &#8220;we hope to be able to see you within the next 12 months&#8221;.&nbsp; The appellant is urged in the meantime
    to remain in contact with his family physician.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The letter from Dr. <span class=SpellE>Beveridge</span> records that it appears the appellant has &#8220;severe degenerative disc
    disease at least 4 levels&#8221;.&nbsp; The letter gives no opinion as to the appellant&#8217;s ability to
    obtain employment similar to his pre-separation employment.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only report that goes any way towards showing a
    disability is the report from Dr. <span class=SpellE>Leckey</span>.&nbsp; However, since this report was not
    properly placed before the court its authenticity and reliability have not been
    tested.&nbsp; Moreover, there is no
    report, letter or affidavit from Dr. Pennell, to whom the report was
    directed.&nbsp; This court is in no
    position to determine the weight, if any, to be attached to the report of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Leckey</span>.&nbsp; It is
    not open to an appellant to simply include documents in an appeal book and
    expect this court to rely upon the information.&nbsp; To do so is unfair to the respondent and
    is of no assistance to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from the decision of Murray J.
    is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There will be no costs of the application or the
    appeal.</p>
