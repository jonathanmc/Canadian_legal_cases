'>[1]</span></span></span></a> from the decision of Little J. acquitting the respondent on a charge of
    attempting to obstruct the course of justice contrary to s. 139 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The trial judge found that the respondent had
    a friend threaten and offer a benefit to the complainant in a sexual assault
    case if she would change her story to exonerate the respondent.  However, the trial judge acquitted the
    respondent because he was only attempting to have the complainant tell the
    truth as he believed it to be.  In my
    view, the trial judge erred in his interpretation of the elements of the
    offence of s. 139.  Accordingly, I would
    allow the appeal, set aside the acquittal and order a new trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 28, 2006, a 16-year-old woman, Ms. Z,
    complained to the police that she had been sexually assaulted by the respondent
    about two weeks earlier.  A few days
    later she gave a videotaped statement.  In the two weeks prior to December 28, Ms.&nbsp;Z and the respondent
    engaged in several communications.  The
    essence of the communications was that the respondent believed that Ms. Z was
    trying to blackmail him by threatening to make false allegations.  The respondent told Ms. Z that she could be
    sued for libel, slander, false prosecution and extortion if she went ahead with
    her complaint.  As indicated, Ms. Z nevertheless
    did in fact make a complaint to the police about the respondent and he was
    charged accordingly with sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The allegation of attempting to obstruct justice arises
    out of the activities of an acquaintance of the respondent, Christian
    Harcus.  Mr. Harcus testified that the
    respondent contacted him and asked him to speak to the complainant and have her
    retract the false complaint.  The
    respondent said that he was wrongfully accused and Mr. Harcus should tell Ms. Z
    that it was in her best interest to retract her statement.  If she didnt then Ms. Zs mother could lose
    her home when the respondent sued her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Harcus accordingly made contact with Ms. Z and
    after some conversation brought her to the respondents lawyers office.  Ms. Z told the lawyer that she did not intend
    to change her statement and that she wanted to speak to the respondent
    directly.  The respondent was in jail at
    the time.  The lawyer refused to arrange
    the telephone call, asked Ms. Z to leave and told Mr. Harcus that he could get
    himself in trouble.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Z gave a somewhat different version of the
    interaction with Mr. Harcus.  She
    testified that on the way to the lawyers office, Mr. Harcus told her that if
    she changed her statement the respondent would provide her with money to go
    shopping at a local mall.  She also
    testified that she felt intimidated by a threat delivered by Mr. Harcus that
    she would be sued in the event that she pursued the allegations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no direct evidence from Mr. Harcus about the
    offer of money to go shopping.  However,
    he had also been charged with attempting to obstruct justice.  He pleaded guilty to the charge, and the facts
    read in by Crown counsel alleged that Mr. Harcus had told Ms. Z that the
    respondent would sue her, that her mother would lose her house, but that the
    respondent would pay for a shopping spree if she changed her statement.  Mr. Harcus testified that he could not recall
    whether in fact he told Ms. Z about a shopping spree inducement.  He also testified that it was possible that
    the respondent spoke to him about a shopping spree.  Mr. Harcus explained that the reason he took
    Ms. Z to the lawyers office was because he did not want the respondent to be
    wrongfully accused nor see Ms. Z lose her house.  Mr. Harcus testified as follows in
    cross-examination:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        He
    [the respondent] told you, in terms of instructions to you, to advise [Ms. Z]
    number one, that these are false <span class=GramE>allegations,</span> the
    sexual assault is a false allegation, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        That
    she has provided false statements to the police in relation to the sexual
    assault, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    if she continues with those false allegations, and that false statement that he
    will sue her, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    he asked you to convey that message to [Ms. Z], correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Correct.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Mr. Harcus also adopted the following passage from his
    preliminary inquiry testimony:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay,
    did he ever instruct you at all to force her in any manner basically through
    threats or anything like that to change her statement?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay,
    was it left kind of open-ended do you know, Im going to leave it to your
    discretion, but what Im telling you is to convey to [Ms. Z], look it, shes
    making false statements and unless she changes those false statements Im going
    to sue her?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Did
    he leave it in your discretion from that point on in terms of how to deal with [Ms.
    Z]?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay,
    those were kind of very narrow instructions, and it was up to you to figure out
    how to bring that about to convey that message.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGES REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred to Mr. Harcuss guilty plea,
    in which he admitted to allegations that he relayed a threat of a lawsuit to
    the complainant and that he offered her benefits if she altered her story.  The trial judge then stated that he found
    that Mr. Harcus had been authorized by the respondent to make the threat of the
    law suit and provide the inducement of the shopping spree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of the offence was made out,
    even though the respondent was only trying to have Ms. Z tell the truth.  However, the respondent did not have the
    requisite <i>mens rea</i>.  The trial judge reasoned as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is a specific intent offence.  Wilfully means that the offence cannot be
    proved on the basis of unknowing conduct.  The mental element is the specific intent to obstruct justice.  No evidence was advanced to show that the
    necessary <i>mens rea</i> existed at the
    time the threat and inducement were provided.  <i>The accused directly and
    indirectly only asked the complainant to tell the truth.  There is no evidence before me that the
    accused did in fact intend to act in a way that would obstruct justice.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case turns on the meaning to be attached to s.
    139(3)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which
    provides that every one who, in a judicial proceeding, dissuades or attempts
    to dissuade a person by threats, bribes or other corrupt means from giving
    evidence shall be deemed to wilfully attempt to obstruct the course of justice.  The gist of the offence is the use of corrupt
    means to influence a witness.  As is said
    in some of the cases, merely attempting by reasoned argument to have a witness
    tell the truth is not an offence.  But
    attempting to persuade a witness to change their testimony, even to change the
    testimony to what the accused believes is the truth, is an offence where the
    means of persuasion is corrupt.  Offering
    money to a complainant in a criminal case to change her testimony is a classic
    example of corrupt means.  See <i>R. v. Kotch</i> (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 132
    (Alta. C.A.) at 136.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the <i>mens
    rea</i> of the offence is made out where the accused intentionally offers the improper
    inducement for the purpose of dissuading the witness from giving evidence, even
    if the accused is merely trying to persuade the witness to tell what the
    accused believes is the truth.  The term
    wilfully requires that the accused act intentionally  for example, that the
    words used be intended as a threat.  More
    importantly, wilfully also requires proof that the threat or inducement was
    made for the prohibited purpose of dissuading the witness.  But the Crown need not prove that the accused
    otherwise had an improper motive.  Equally,
    it is no defence that the accuseds motive was to ensure that the truth was
    told at the judicial proceeding.  For the
    purposes of this case it is unnecessary to decide whether recklessness would
    also suffice to establish that the accused acted wilfully.  See <i>R.
    v. Buzzanga and Durocher</i> (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.), at 379-82.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the trial judge erred in acquitting the
    respondent on the basis that his motive was to ensure that Ms. Z told the
    truth.  Ordinarily, the appropriate
    disposition, given the trial judges findings of fact, would be to set aside
    the acquittal and enter a conviction.  However, I am concerned about the basis for the trial judges finding
    that Mr. Harcus made the various threats and inducements at the instigation of
    the respondent.  In particular, there was
    little or no admissible evidence that the respondent had asked Mr.&nbsp;Harcus
    to offer Ms. Z money for a shopping spree and the trial judge did not identify
    the evidence he relied upon.  At its
    highest, Mr. Harcus conceded that it was possible that the respondent talked to
    him about a shopping spree.  Mr. Harcus
    did not adopt as true all the facts read in at his guilty plea proceedings and
    the trial judge made no express finding that the statements made at those
    proceedings should be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule.  This court has recently suggested that care
    should be taken in admitting for their truth facts read in at a witnesss
    guilty plea as an exception to the hearsay rule.  See <i>R.
    v. Tran</i>, 2010 ONCA 471 at paras. 40-3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was somewhat clearer that the respondent had instructed
    Mr. Harcus to tell Ms.&nbsp;Z that if she persisted in her false complaint he
    would sue her.  The more difficult
    question is whether the respondent had the specific intent to threaten Ms.
    Z.  In other words was this an improper
    attempt to intimidate the witness by corrupt means or merely an attempt at
