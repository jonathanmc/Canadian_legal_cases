  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the decision of Mesbur J. upholding
    the decision of the Consent and Capacity Board that the appellant was not
    capable of making treatment decisions with respect to anti-psychotic and side
    effect medication.  With the assistance
    of <i>amicus</i>, the appellant submits that
    the finding of incapacity was unreasonable and should be set aside.  For the following reasons, the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has a lengthy history of involvement with
    mental health facilities and the criminal justice system.  The consent and capacity issue began in April
    1998 when the appellant was remanded by the criminal courts to the Whitby
    Mental Health Centre for an assessment while he was facing a charge of uttering
    a threat to a judge of the Superior Court of Justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s then treating psychiatrist, Dr. Julian
    Gojer, found that the appellant was not capable of consenting to treatment with
    anti-psychotic and side-effect medication.  The Board confirmed that decision in May 1998.  The appellant unsuccessfully appealed that
    decision to the Superior Court of Justice and then to this court.  In July 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada
    refused leave to appeal.  While those
    proceedings worked their way through the judicial system, the appellant did not
    receive any treatment, in accordance with s. 18 of the <i>Health Care Consent Act, 1996</i>, S.O. 1996, c. 2, Schedule A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, on May 22, 1998, the appellant was
    discharged from the Whitby Mental Health Centre back to the criminal courts
    because the assessment had been completed.  On June 19, 1998, the appellant was found not criminally responsible and
    readmitted to Whitby.  Dr. Gojer made
    another finding in July 1998 that the appellant was not capable of consenting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By 2005, the appellant, who was still an in-patient at
    the Whitby Mental Health Centre, was being treated by the respondent, Dr.
    Stanley Barron.  Having learned that the
    appeal proceedings were at an end, Dr. Barron initiated treatment with
    antipsychotic drugs with the substitute consent of the appellant’s
    parents.  The appellant immediately
    commenced another application to the Board, which upheld the decision.  An appeal from that decision was dismissed by
    Ferguson J.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After six months had elapsed, the appellant initiated
    another application to review the finding of incapacity to consent to treatment.  The Board heard that application on February
    3, 2006 and dismissed the application on February 6, 2006.  It is this last decision that was appealed to
    Mesbur J. and which is the subject of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two issues before Mesbur J.  The primary focus of the appeal was the reasonableness
    of the decision holding that the appellant lacked the capacity to consent.  But the appellant also argued that the Board
    erred in holding that it had no jurisdiction under s. 18 of the Act to stop
    treatment pending disposition of the application.  This second issue was not raised in the
    appellant’s notice of appeal to this court and was not addressed in argument.
    Accordingly, I need not deal with that issue.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPELLANT’S MENTAL STATE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has had many psychiatric admissions since
    1982.  While he was at one time diagnosed
    with schizophrenia, his current diagnosis is a delusional disorder, grandiose
    type and narcissistic personality disorder.  The most obvious indication of mental illness is the appellant’s false
    belief that he is the rightful King of Canada.  He believes that there has been a long-standing plot to kill him because
    of his status.  However, that is not the
    only symptom of his illness. For example, a report prepared in 2004, before
    treatment began, indicated that although his behaviour had improved somewhat,
    he was still experiencing significant difficulties and continued to be verbally
    threatening and physically abusive to staff and other patients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Barron testified before the Board in 2006 that the
    appellant did not believe he was mentally ill and therefore did not require any
    medication.  By the time of the hearing,
    the appellant had been on the anti-psychotic medication for six months.  The appellant had told Dr. Barron that he
    wanted to be taken off the medication because of the side effects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Barron testified that he and the treatment team
    were of the view that the appellant had made significant progress since he had
    been on the medication.  Although there
    was no change in his belief that he was the rightful King of Canada, his
    behaviour was vastly improved so that it was now possible that the appellant
    would be able to live in the community.  As
    a result of the treatment, the appellant had moved more quickly through
    privilege levels within the institution.  His family had also noted a great improvement.  He was more cooperative, pleasant and
    helpful.  Dr. Barron was of the opinion
    that the appellant would not have been able to reach the level he was at or
    progress to community living without medication and that his condition would
    deteriorate if the medication was stopped.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Barron told the Board that the appellant did not
    recognize that his progress and improvement were related to the
    medication.  He believed that he had
    started to improve before the medication and any change was entirely of his own
    doing.  In fact, he believed that he
    would be much better if he was not on medication because the medication was
    causing side effects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Dr. Barron, the appellant is very
    intelligent and knew that he was in hospital and in a unit where many others
    suffered from mental illness.  However, the
    appellant thought he was being hospitalized because he is the King of Canada
    and that those in power had to keep him in hospital to keep him away from
    power.  On an intellectual level, he
    understood the benefits of medication in some cases for treating mental
    illness, but that did not apply to him.  He had no insight into his illness and therefore no appreciation that he
    would improve with the medication. Dr. Barron was of the view that the
    appellant was not capable of making treatment decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified at the hearing before the
    Board.  He testified that his progress
    had been severely curtailed because of the medication and that stopping the
    medication would increase his privileges and <span class=GramE>enhance</span> his chances of living in the community.  In any event, even if he did deteriorate, he would rather be in hospital
    because being off medication was much more important to him.  For him, it was a question of quality of
    life.  As he put it, “It’s not really
    freedom to be out there all zombied up with medication.  I’m a free man.  I was born free and I want to be free.  It’s not acceptable to me.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also complained about side effects from
    the medication.  A treatment note made
    two months after treatment began indicated that the appellant had ceased
    certain physical activities. However, Dr. Barron testified that aside from some
    weight gain, the side effects about which the appellant complained, such as
    anxiety and restlessness, were not observed by the treatment team and could not
    be confirmed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no dispute that the medication has not
    affected the appellant’s core belief that he is the rightful King of Canada and
    that belief persists until today.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION OF THE BOARD</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for capacity to make treatment decisions is
    set out in s. 4 of the Act.  I set out the
    test below, omitting the inapplicable parts as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. (1) A person is capable with respect to a
    treatment … if the person is able to understand the information that is
    relevant to making a decision about the treatment … and able to appreciate the
    reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board rested its conclusion on the second part of
    the test, the ability to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of
    a decision or lack of decision.  While
    the appellant could appreciate certain negative effects of the medication, he
    could not appreciate any positive benefits.  The Board held that the appellant was unable to appreciate the
    reasonably foreseeable positive benefits of a decision to consent to treatment
    and was unable to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable negative consequences
    of a decision to refuse treatment.  As
    the Board said, the appellant’s illness “had stolen his ability to process the
    information that he might be affected by a mental illness or any manifestation
    of a mental illness.  The deficit
    produced by the illness resulted in an inability to appreciate the consequences
    of a decision or lack of decision.”  The
    inability to recognize his illness is a direct result of the condition.</p>
  <h4><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>DECISION OF MESBUR J.</span></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge held that the standard of review of
    the Board’s decision was reasonableness.  She held that there was ample evidence to support the finding that the
    appellant suffers from a mental condition.  She also held that the Board’s decision on capacity was supported by the
    evidence.  The appellant does not
    appreciate that he suffers from a mental illness and cannot appreciate the
    consequences of his decision to refuse treatment.  The Board’s decision was reasonable and
    accordingly the appeal failed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Constitutional Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raised a number of issues concerning the
    constitutionality of the Act.  His
    principal submission was that the test for capacity as set out in s. 4 of the
    Act is so vague that its application results in a deprivation of liberty that
    does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.  I would not give effect to this
    submission.  The test for vagueness is a
    strict one.  As was said in <i>Canadian
    Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at para. 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A law is unconstitutionally vague if it “does not
    provide an adequate basis for legal debate&quot; and “analysis”; “does not
    sufficiently delineate any area of risk&quot;; or &quot;is not intelligible”.
    The law must offer a “grasp to the judiciary”: <i>R. v. Nova Scotia
    Pharmaceutical Society</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, at pp. 639-40. Certainty is
    not required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test set out in s. 4 is not unconstitutionally
    vague.  To the contrary, the test has
    been defined with reasonable precision by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Starson v. Swayze</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 722,
    at para. 78, <i>per</i> Major J. for the
    majority:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Capacity involves two criteria. First, a person
    must be able to understand the information that is relevant to making a
    treatment decision. This requires the cognitive ability to process, retain and
    understand the relevant information. ... Second, a person must be able to
    appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the decision or lack of
    one. This requires the patient to be able to apply the relevant information to
    his or her circumstances, and to be able to weigh the foreseeable risks and
    benefits of a decision or lack thereof.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Further, Major J. went on to elaborate on the test at paras.
    79-81:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before turning to an analysis of the reviewing
    judge’s decision, two important points regarding this statutory test require
    comment. First, a patient need not agree with the diagnosis of the attending
    physician in order to be able to apply the relevant information to his own
    circumstances. Psychiatry is not an exact science, and “capable but dissident
    interpretations of information” are to be expected: see Weisstub Report, <i>supra</i>,
    at p. 229. While a patient need not agree with a particular diagnosis, if it is
    demonstrated that he has a mental “condition”, the patient must be able to
    recognize the possibility that he is affected by that condition. Professor
    Weisstub comments on this requirement as follows (at p. 250, note 443):</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Condition refers to the broader manifestations
    of the illness rather than the existence of a discrete diagnosable pathology.
    The word condition allows the requirement for understanding to focus on the
    objectively discernible manifestations of the illness rather than the
    interpretation that is made of these manifestations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a result, a patient is
    not required to describe his mental condition as an “illness”, or to otherwise
    characterize the condition in negative terms. Nor is a patient required to
    agree with the attending physician’s opinion regarding the cause of that
    condition. Nonetheless, if the patient’s condition results in him being unable
    to recognize that he is affected by its manifestations, he will be unable to
    apply the relevant information to his circumstances, and unable to appreciate
    the consequences of his decision.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Secondly, the Act requires a patient to have the <u>ability</u> to appreciate the consequences of a decision. It does not require <u>actual</u> appreciation of those consequences. The distinction is subtle but important:
    see L. H. Roth, A. Meisel and C. W. Lidz, “Tests of Competency to Consent to
    Treatment” (1977), 134 <i>Am. J. Psychiatry</i> 279, at pp. 281-82, and
    Weisstub Report, <i>supra</i>, at p. 249. In practice, the determination of
    capacity should begin with an inquiry into the patient’s actual appreciation of
    the parameters of the decision being made: the nature and purpose of the
    proposed treatment; the foreseeable benefits and risks of treatment; the
    alternative courses of action available; and the expected consequences of not
    having the treatment. If the patient shows an appreciation of these parameters
    -- regardless of whether he weighs or values the information differently than
    the attending physician and disagrees with the treatment recommendation -- he
    has the ability to appreciate the decision he makes: see Roth, Meisel and Lidz, <i>supra</i>, at p. 281.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, a patient’s failure to demonstrate actual
    appreciation does not inexorably lead to a conclusion of incapacity. The
    patient’s lack of appreciation may derive from causes that do not undermine his <u>ability</u> to appreciate consequences. For instance, a lack of appreciation
    may reflect the attending physician’s failure to adequately inform the patient
    of the decision’s consequences: see the Weisstub Report, <i>supra</i>, at p.
    249. Accordingly, it is imperative that the Board inquire into the reasons for
    the patient’s failure to appreciate consequences. A finding of incapacity is
    justified only if those reasons demonstrate that the patient’s mental disorder
    prevents him from having the <u>ability</u> to appreciate the foreseeable
    consequences of the decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test may be difficult to apply in some cases, but
    that is not the same as vagueness and does not result in arbitrary or unfair
    decision-making.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Was the Board’s Decision Reasonable?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, supported by the very helpful
    submissions of <i>amicus</i>, Ms. Perez,
    submits that the Board’s decision was unreasonable.  They submit that the evidence demonstrates
    that the appellant appreciates the consequences of the failure to treat.  He understands that the result may be that he
    will remain in hospital, but that is his choice.  In effect, the Board applied a best interests
    test, imposing treatment on him, not because he lacked capacity to consent, but
    because the respondent and the Board believed that treatment was in his best
    interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also says that his case is unique.  He is being treated on the basis of a
    decision made more than 12 years ago.  Further, after the finding of incapacity was made by Dr. Gojer, the
    appellant was discharged from the hospital and therefore must have been deemed
    capable at that time.  I would point out,
    however, that this is not an entirely accurate picture of events.  The appellant was not discharged from Whitby
    in May 1998 because he no longer suffered from a mental illness or was capable
    of consenting but because the remand for assessment had expired.  Once the appellant was returned to Whitby
    after the finding that he was not criminally responsible, Dr. <span
class=GramE>Gojer,</span> reaffirmed his finding that the appellant lacked
    capacity to consent in July 1998.  Further, the respondent, Dr. Barron, testified before the Board in 2006
    that the appellant continued to lack the capacity to consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Board applied the correct test as set
    down in <i>Starson</i> and did not make the
    error attributed to it by the appellant and <i>amicus</i> of applying a best interests test.  The
    Board referred both to the statutory test and the test laid down by Major J. in <i>Starson</i>.  The facts as found by the Board fit within
    Major J.’s explanation of the test in para. 79: “if the patient’s condition results in him being unable to recognize
    that he is affected by its manifestations, he will be unable to apply the
    relevant information to his circumstances, and unable to appreciate the
    consequences of his decision”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of his mental condition, which does not
    simply include his fixed false belief that he is the rightful King of Canada, the
    appellant is unable to recognize that he is mentally ill.  As a result, he cannot apply the information
    to his circumstances.  He cannot
    appreciate that without the medication his condition will deteriorate.  While the appellant verablizes that he would
    rather be in hospital without <span class=GramE>medication, that</span> is not
    the same as appreciating the consequences of the failure to treat.  For his belief is not that lack of medication
    will cause his return to hospital.  Rather,
    he believes that he will continue to improve without the medication.  The respondent’s opinion that the appellant’s
    condition will deteriorate is firmly anchored in the evidence, including
    evidence of the experience both before and after the appellant began treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant recognizes some of the negative effects
    of treatment, namely the side effects.  But he has no appreciation of the positive effects of treatment or the
    negative effects of the failure to treat.  To the contrary, as set out above, he believes that his progress is
    solely the result of his own efforts and that the treatment has retarded his progress.  That is manifestly not the case.  Moreover, his failure to appreciate is
    directly related to his mental condition.  Because of his false ideas, he does not appreciate that he is ill and
    does not appreciate that he needs medication.  He attributes his hospitalization, not to his illness, but to the fact
    that evil forces are conspiring to keep him from assuming his proper role in
    this country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s case is quite different from that of <i>Starson</i>.  As explained by Major J. at para. 92 of the <i>Starson</i> case, Professor Starson understood that he suffered from a
    mental condition and appreciated the purpose of the medication and the possible
    benefits suggested by the doctors.  He
    preferred his altered state to what he viewed as the boredom of normalcy.  This appellant does not understand that he
    suffers from a mental condition nor does he appreciate the purpose of the
    medication and the possible benefits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the medication has had no impact on the
    appellant’s core belief about his place in Canada’s constitutional framework,
    but that does not mean that the medication has not had a positive impact on the
    appellant.  He is able to function at a
    high level in hospital and would soon be able to move into the community; the
    behaviour that had led him into conflict with the law and admission to
    psychiatric facilities, and which was a consequence of his mental condition,
    has abated.  There is also no reliable
    evidence that the serious side effects that the appellant was so concerned
    about have manifested themselves.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Board’s decision was reasonable and the
    appeal judge properly upheld that decision.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
