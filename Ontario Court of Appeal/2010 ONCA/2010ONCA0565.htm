  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellants successfully sued the respondents for damages suffered in a motor
    vehicle accident. Prior to trial, the appellants twice asked the respondents,
    as represented by their insurer, to participate in mediation, but, contrary to
    its statutory obligation, the respondents’ insurer refused, on the basis that
    it did not believe that Mr. Keam’s  damages would meet the statutory threshold under s. 267.5(5) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  When dealing with costs following trial, the
    trial judge accepted the insurer’s position as legitimate and declined the
    appellants’ request for substantial indemnity costs as a remedy for its failure
    to participate in mediation, pursuant to s. 258.6(2) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The issue on
    appeal is whether any cost consequence should attach to the insurer’s failure
    to participate in statutorily mandated mediation. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were involved in a motor vehicle accident
    on April 10, 2003, in which Mr. Keam suffered personal injuries. This action
    was commenced in May, 2004 and defended in October, 2004 by the respondents’
    insurer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following examinations for discovery, counsel for the
    appellants made the first of two formal requests for private mediation under s.
    258.6(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> by
    letter of September 13, 2006. The letter suggested several names as potential
    mediators, and stated that if the respondents did not participate<span
class=GramE>,  the</span> letter would be
    referred to after trial on the issue of costs. The respondents apparently did
    not respond to this first request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By letter of June 26, 2007, counsel renewed the request
    that the respondents’ insurer participate in private mediation of the claim,
    and again referred to costs consequences following trial if the insurer failed
    to participate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By letter of July 3, 2007, respondents’ counsel replied
    that they were of the opinion that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Keam’s</span> injuries
    did not meet the threshold test under the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, and “[a]ccordingly, my client is unwilling to undergo private
    mediation of this claim.” In that letter, the respondents offered to consent to
    dismissal of the action without costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A year later, with the trial scheduled for October,
    2008, the respondents served an offer to settle on July 16, 2008 for $17,500
    for general damages plus prejudgment interest from April 17, 2003 to September
    30, 2004, and partial indemnity costs. This offer effectively acknowledged that
    Mr. Keam’s claim could meet the statutory threshold test, and therefore
    mediation would not necessarily have been futile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 1, 2008, the respondents served a further
    offer to settle for $17,500 for general damages, plus prejudgment interest at
    5% from November 27, 2003, and partial indemnity costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the same date, the appellants served an offer to
    settle for general damages of $60,000, 5% prejudgment interest from November
    27, 2003, special and pecuniary damages of $130,000, damages of $15,000 under
    the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    C.&nbsp;F.3, and partial indemnity costs, including disbursements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No offer was accepted and the action proceeded to
    trial. Following an 11-day trial in October, 2008, the jury awarded the
    appellants $70,000 in general damages (resulting in an award of $55,000 after
    the statutory deductible was subtracted), $22,500 for the <i>Family Law Act</i> claim, $1,200 for past loss of income, plus
    prejudgment interest of $19,360.20.  As a
    result, although there were no Rule 49 costs consequences, having won their
    case, the plaintiffs were entitled to partial indemnity costs in the ordinary
    course.  The trial judge also determined
    that Mr. Keam’s claim met the statutory threshold under the <i>Insurance Act.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties subsequently filed written submissions on
    costs, and on September 10, 2009, they made oral submissions. The trial judge
    issued written reasons dealing with the issue of costs on September 29, 2009. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both before the trial judge and in oral submissions on
    this appeal, the appellants took the position that they were entitled to
    substantial indemnity costs as a result of the insurer’s refusal to participate
    in mandatory mediation. The trial judge followed suit and treated the question
    of the effect of the insurer’s refusal to attend mediation as a choice between
    the partial and substantial indemnity rate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred to the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s decision in <i>Young v. Young</i>,
    [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at p. 134, where the court described the type of conduct by
    a party to litigation that would attract an award of substantial indemnity
    costs as “reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge treated the statutory obligation to
    participate in mediation as part of the duty to try to settle, and assessed the
    conduct of the insurer in that context, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is a range of behaviour between a refusal to
    mediate or settle based on an apparent reasonable assessment, and high handed
    behaviour. If the refusal to mediate or settle, can be characterized as a
    genuine available position based on a review of all the known circumstances,
    then the cost consequences can not be any more than the extra costs generated
    as a consequence of the litigation not ending at that juncture.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, where the defendant’s insurer’s refusal
    to mediate was a “genuine available position”, then the plaintiff who was
    successful at trial, and therefore already entitled to partial indemnity costs,
    would receive nothing more in costs as a result of <span class=GramE>the  insurer’s</span> pre-trial conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that in this case the
    insurer’s decision not to mediate could not be characterized as malevolent.
    Rather, the position that the damages would not meet the threshold, and
    therefore mediation would be futile, was a legitimate position to take and did
    not warrant the imposition of substantial indemnity costs.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Did the trial judge err in failing to
    award substantial indemnity costs? </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            If
    not, what was the proper cost consequence for the insurer’s failure to attend
    and participate in statutorily mandated mediation?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Statutory Framework</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statutory framework for the analysis is found in
    ss. 258.6(1) and (2) of the <i>Insurance Act,</i> which read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>258.6(1) A person making a claim for loss or damage
    from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or
    operation of an automobile and an insurer that is defending an action in respect
    of the claim on behalf of an insured or that receives a notice under clause
    258.3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) in respect of the claim <i>shall</i>, on the request of either of them, <i>participate in a mediation of the claim</i> in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the regulations. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) In an action in
    respect of the claim, a person’s failure to comply with this section <i>shall be considered by the court</i> in
    awarding costs. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3 of O.Reg. 461/96 prescribes the procedure and
    time limits for appointing a mediator and conducting the mediation, and
    provides that the defendant’s insurer is to pay the reasonable fees and
    expenses of the mediator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two other sections of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, ss. 258.5(1) and (5), also provide relevant context
    for this analysis:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>258.5(1) An insurer that is defending an action for
    loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from
    the use or operation of an automobile on behalf of an insured or that receives
    a notice under clause 258.3(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) from an insured
    shall attempt to settle the claim as expeditiously as possible.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Subsections 2, 3 and 4 require an insurer that
    admits liability to make advance payments in defined amounts.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) In an action for
    loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising directly from the use or
    operation of an automobile, an insurer’s failure to comply with this section
    shall be considered by the court in awarded costs.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Insurer’s Duty to Attempt to <span class=GramE>Settle</span> and to Mediate </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 258.5(1) and 258.6(1) are directed at an
    insurer that is defending a claim for personal injuries arising out of an
    automobile accident. The sections impose two obligations on the insurer.
    Section 258.6(1) makes participating in mediation mandatory when requested,
    while s. 258.5(1) requires the insurer to attempt to settle the claim as
    expeditiously as possible. Sections 258.6(2) and s. 258.5(2) provide the
    sanction for non-compliance with the statutory duties: the court is required to
    consider the insurer’s failure to comply when awarding costs following trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislature has clearly determined that in every
    case where one party is willing, mediation is the best way to try to promote
    the settlement of claims and to avoid the expense of a possibly lengthy and
    certainly costly trial. The legislature has provided no exceptions to this
    policy or to the obligation to mediate that it has imposed to implement the
    policy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because there are no exceptions to the obligation, the
    insurer has no option whether or not to participate. There can be no legitimate
    reason to refuse to participate because to elect not to participate constitutes
    a breach of the insurer’s statutory obligation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the respondents’ insurer took the
    position that the claim did not meet the threshold and therefore there was
    nothing to negotiate. However, it is this approach that the legislature has
    disavowed by making mediation mandatory. Rather, the legislature’s approach
    recognizes that participation in mediation could have a salutary effect on one
    or both sides, with input from an experienced and respected mediator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge referred to the position
    of the respondents’ insurer as “playing hardball”.  Indeed, the insurer did appear to be playing
    hardball because prior to trial it changed its position on whether Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Keam’s</span> claim could meet the threshold by making an offer to
    settle. Another effect of requiring insurers to attend mediation is to prevent
    them from playing hardball without first participating in serious settlement
    endeavours, including through the mediation process.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Cost Consequences of an Insurer’s Failure to Participate
    in Mediation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to make the insurer’s statutory obligation to
    participate in mediation meaningful, the legislature had to find a way to put
    teeth into it by providing a consequence for failure to comply.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Where the claim is settled prior to trial, there is no mechanism for any such
    consequence. However, following trial, where an insurer has not complied, the
    trial judge is required to consider the appropriate cost consequence of the
    insurer’s actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cost consequences will follow whether the plaintiff
    or the defendant has been successful at trial, so that, for example, where a
    plaintiff’s claim is dismissed, the trial judge may deprive the winning
    defendant – represented by the insurer that refused to accept a request to
    mediate– of all or part of its costs that would normally follow the event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason a costs sanction for failure to comply with
    provisions intended to facilitate early settlement is an appropriate
    legislative choice was explained by Morden&nbsp;J.A. in <i>McCombie v. Cadotte, </i>at para. 18: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[F]<span class=SpellE>ailure</span> to comply with a request in s. 258.3(1) [plaintiff required to attend a defence
    medical before commencing an action] can lead only, in some cases, to a claim not
    being settled as soon as it might otherwise have been settled if there had been
    compliance. In these circumstances, the consequence is that more time and
    expense would have been spent on the claim than, possibly, should have been
    spent. It seems to me that the possible costs sanctions provided for in ss.
    258.3(9), 258.5(5), <i>and 258.6(2)</i> are
    responses logically tailored to remedy the effect of non-compliance. The
    failure to settle sooner results in increased costs; accordingly, the <i>remedial penalty</i> is to be incorporated
    in the costs order in the proceeding. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morden J.A. describes the costs sanction as a “remedial
    penalty”. It is remedial because it is intended not only to compel compliance
    by insurers with an important statutory purpose, but also to provide a remedy
    to the other party who was deprived of the opportunity for an early settlement
    of the claim. It is a penalty, because it is not intended to be merely
    compensatory of costs unnecessarily incurred by the other party or parties, as
    that objective is already addressed by other costs provisions of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194, but to provide a meaningful consequence to an insurer that elects not
    to comply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislature chose not to provide a specific cost
    consequence for an insurer’s failure to participate in mediation, such as
    substantial indemnity costs against a losing defendant or deprivation of full
    costs of a winning defendant. Instead, the trial judge is accorded the
    discretion to determine the appropriate cost consequence in each case. In
    summary, where an insurer breaches s. 258.6(1), s. 258.6(2) requires the trial
    judge to ascertain the appropriate remedial costs penalty in the circumstances.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Appropriate Cost Consequence in this Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in law by finding that the
    insurer’s decision not to participate in mediation was a legitimate one and a
    genuine available position, as that decision constituted a breach of the
    insurer’s statutory obligation. Based on his characterization of the insurer’s
    decision as legitimate and available, the trial judge decided to impose no cost
    penalty on the insurer. In fairness to the trial judge, as discussed above, the
    plaintiff sought only an award of substantial indemnity costs and it was only
    that option that the trial judge considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approaching the issue afresh, the factors that in my
    view impact on the magnitude of the costs penalty that ought to have been
    imposed include: (1) the fact that the insurer twice refused to mediate, the
    first time two years before trial and the second time over one year before
    trial; (2) the fact that it decided to “play hardball” by taking the easy
    position that the claim did not meet the threshold; (3) the fact that shortly
    before trial it served an offer to settle, which, while low, amounted to
    acceptance that there was a potential claim to litigate – and therefore to
    mediate; (4) the size of the recovery; and (5) the 11-day duration of the
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ substantial indemnity bill totalled
    $196,144.90, plus $9,807.25 GST, and its partial bill was $130,352.20, plus
    GST. The trial judge awarded the appellants partial indemnity costs, which he
    fixed at $110,000 plus GST for fees. Although the insurer’s conduct may not
    have risen to the level required for the imposition of substantial indemnity
    costs, in my view<span class=GramE>,  a</span> significant remedial penalty was required in all the circumstances. I would
    order an increase of $40,000 in the costs award to reflect the censure of the
    court and to provide an appropriately significant recovery for the appellants.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, and increase the quantum of
    the fee portion of the costs awarded to the appellants at trial from $110,000
    to $150,000 plus applicable taxes. Counsel advised the court at the hearing
    that costs of the appeal were agreed, and did not require an order from the
    court.</p>
