    the respondent, Carole Rollin, fell and broke her wrist. At the local hospital,
    an x-ray revealed a Colles’ fracture.  Ms. Rollin underwent a closed reduction surgery that involved
    manipulating the wrist back into place without making an incision into the
    skin. </span></p>

    procedure confirmed that the joint was properly aligned and Dr. Baker proceeded
    to apply a cast to hold the reset bones in place.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Upon her discharge from the hospital, Ms. Rollin was given
    instructions that, in a about a week, she should have an x-ray taken and follow
    up with her family doctor.  She was
    unable to reach her doctor but did manage to have an x-ray taken.  Unfortunately, various important follow-up
    steps were not taken in a timely fashion and Ms. Rollin’s wrist did not heal
    properly. Even after several corrective surgeries, Ms. Rollin continues to
    suffer from pain, disfigurement and limitations in the use of her hand.</span></p>

    commenced this action in negligence against Dr. Baker, the hospital and an
    unidentified radiologist. The action was discontinued against the hospital and
    the radiologist and the trial proceeded against Dr. Baker only. Ms. Rollin
    alleged that Dr. Baker was negligent in not x-raying her wrist after applying
    the cast to determine if movement had taken place during the application of the
    cast and in not making provision for her optimal recovery after she left his
    care.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In lengthy and detailed reasons, the trial judge found that
    Dr. Baker fell below the standard of care by failing to follow proper x-ray
    procedures, failing to provide sufficient information about after-care, and
    failing to ensure either that Ms. Rollin’s family doctor was able to take
    responsibility for her care or that she was provided with an appropriate
    back-up. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In this appeal, Dr. Baker does not challenge the trial
    judge’s finding of negligence arising out of his not having x-rayed Ms.
    Rollin’s wrist after he put the cast on her arm.  He does, however, challenge the trial judge’s
    assessment of the standard of care in relation to Ms. Rollin’s after-care. He
    also challenges causation and damages.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, in
    part.  In my view, the trial judge erred
    by apparently awarding general damages as though Dr. Baker was  responsible for all of the consequences of the
    broken wrist rather than just those that Ms. Rollin would not have experienced
    but for the doctor’s negligence.  I would
    therefore reduce the amount awarded for general damages.  I would dismiss the appeal in all other
    respects.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge’s comprehensive 46-page judgment focuses on
    the two aspects of Dr. Baker’s allegedly negligent care of Ms. Rollin.  Both concern the risk of displacement of the
    wrist bones after closed reduction surgery in response to a Colles’
    fracture.  The first involves taking an
    x-ray after the application of the cast in order to detect slippage that may
    have taken place when the cast was put on.  The second involves post-surgical monitoring so that corrective measures
    can be taken before the bones set if slippage occurs during the healing process.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         The Evidence of the Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Since there was no issue over the fact that Dr. Baker did not
    take an x-ray of Ms. Rollin’s wrist after he applied the cast, the trial
    judge’s review of the parties’ evidence concentrated on after-care.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>According to Ms. Rollin, Dr. Baker did not personally provide
    her with any instructions with respect to the after-care of her injury.  And the information she received from the
    nurse was minimal – nothing more than that she should have an x-ray taken in
    seven to ten days and see her family doctor.  Neither Dr. Baker nor the nurse told her that there was a significant
    risk of displacement during the first few weeks following the surgery and that
    it was therefore important that she have regular x-rays taken and that she be
    monitored by a doctor qualified to oversee recovery from a Colles’
    fracture.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Baker’s evidence was that he had some recollection of
    treating Ms. Rollin. He recalled taking her history, reviewing her initial x-ray,
    and indicating to her that she had a bad fracture.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>His evidence about after-care was based on his usual practice.  Dr. Baker testified that he would have instructed
    Ms. Rollin that she should go to her family doctor, that she needed to have an
    x-ray in seven to ten days, and that she probably would need to be referred to
    an orthopaedic surgeon. He further testified that he would have told her that
    if she encountered any problems, she should contact him and he would do the
    follow-up.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. Baker conceded that he did not advise Ms. Rollin about
    the high risk of displacement during the first three weeks after she left the
    hospital and for this reason she should have an x-ray taken once a week for
    three consecutive weeks. </span></p>

    required by a general surgeon in the position of Dr. Baker – Dr. Mandel, on
    behalf of Ms. Rollin, and Dr. McGoey, on behalf of Dr. Baker. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    with over 20 years of experience, testified on Ms. Rollin’s behalf as both a
    fact and an expert witness.  In his
    opinion, Ms. Rollin’s break was particularly serious as the fracture line was
    into the joint.  Due to the considerable
    fragmentation, the alignment of the wrist bones was more likely to slip.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>His opinion as to the obligations of a physician in the
    position of Dr. Baker in ensuring proper after-care of a Colles’ fracture was
    summarized by the trial judge as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)     The doctor should x-ray the wrist after the cast is put on to see
    if any slippage took place during the cast application process; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)     The doctor should ensure
    that the patient clearly understands that an x-ray should be taken once a week
    for at least three weeks following the surgery; and, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)     The doctor should ensure
    that the patient has access to a physician who is both competent to care for a
    Colles’ fracture and available to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>With respect to this third obligation, the trial judge
    described Dr. Mandel’s view as follows.  A physician in Dr. Baker’s position had a specific duty to ensure that
    his patient had access to a doctor equipped to handle the risks associated with
    a Colles’ fracture and was available to do so.  Given that family doctors are generally not familiar with Colles’
    fractures and that Dr. Baker had no communication with Dr. Lummack in order to
    satisfy himself that Dr. Lummack was both able and available to take on the
    responsibility of Ms. Rollin’s after-<span class=GramE>care,</span> Dr. Baker fell
    below the standard of care.  The standard
    of care required more, such as a referral directly to an orthopaedic surgeon or
    a fracture clinic.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>While Dr. McGoey’s view was that it was preferable to take an
    x-ray after the cast is put on, this was the “gold standard”.  In his opinion, Dr. Baker’s treatment of Ms.
    Rollin was “okay” given he took an x-ray after the reduction but before he put
    the cast on and was satisfied that there had been no slippage during the cast
    application process. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Dr. McGoey agreed that the after-care of a Colles’ fracture
    is time-sensitive and needs to be closely monitored.  He testified that he would have made sure
    that the patient understood the need for prompt follow-up care due to
    complications that may arise from slippage in the cast.  He agreed with Dr. Mandel that the wrist
    should be x-rayed seven to ten days after the reduction and thereafter weekly
    for three weeks. He explained that the rationale behind repeating the x-ray is
    that as the swelling in the arm goes down, the cast loosens and displacement
    may occur. A final x-ray should be taken at the five or six week mark. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>His view was that Dr. Baker met the standard of care in terms
    of follow-up through the instructions contained in the
    <st1:stockticker w:st="on">
    ACU
    Report and the Consultation Report, both of which were sent to Dr.
    Lummack.  It was appropriate, in Dr.
    McGoey’s opinion, for Dr. Baker to refer his patient to her family doctor if he
    did not know a specialist in her area. He did not share Dr. Mandel’s concern about
    the ability of family doctors to assume responsibility for the after-care of a
    Colles’ fracture. To his knowledge, most family doctors take courses that would
    educate them as to the high risk of displacement associated with Colles’
    fractures and the importance of close monitoring of the healing of the wrist
    through regular x-rays.</span></p>

    is to ensure that the bones had not moved during the process of putting the
    cast on.  While acknowledging the subtle difference
    in their opinions, the trial judge found that both Dr. Mandel and Dr. McGoey essentially
    agreed that the standard of care in treating a Colles’ fracture after closed
    reduction surgery requires that an x-ray be taken after the cast is applied to
    ensure that no slippage had occurred as the cast is applied.  Based on this evidence, the trial judge
    concluded that Dr. Baker fell below the standard of care in not x-raying Ms.
    Rollin’s wrist after he put the cast on. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(b)       The follow-up

    identified critical after-care concerns regarding which Dr. Baker should have
    instructed Ms. Rollin involving the risk of slippage and the importance of
    having an x-ray taken once a week for three consecutive weeks so as to be able
    to respond immediately to any displacement that may have occurred. <b><i> </i></b>Since the trial judge found that Ms.
    Rollin had not been given this important information, she held that Dr. Baker
    fell below the standard of care in relation to his obligation to ensure that
    his patient was equipped to attend to the demands of her after-care.<b><i></i></b></span></p>

    “the referring physician must be confident that the person the case is being
    handed over to is available, competent and able to deal with the problem”.  She therefore held that there must be direct
    communication between the referring physician and the receiving physician to
    ensure access to a doctor “with the expertise and ability to deal with a
    serious Colles’ fracture.”</span></p>

    meet his obligations to his patient under the capable hands component.  Aside from directly contacting Dr. Lummack’s
    office, he could have referred Ms. Rollin to an orthopaedic surgeon in her area
    or to a fracture clinic. Finally, Dr. Baker could have scheduled a follow-up appointment
    with him. </span></p>

    Baker as to the referral options presented to her.  She found as a fact that Dr. Baker did not
    offer to become involved in the follow-up.  Ms. Rollin was only told to go and see her
    family doctor. The trial judge therefore concluded that Dr. Baker fell below
    the standard of care in advising his patient to see her family doctor without

    Dr. Baker left Ms. Rollin with only one option – to go see her family doctor - in
    the light of his evidence that he would have told her that she could return to
    him if there were any difficulties with follow-up.   Dr. Baker relies on his unchallenged testimony
    that, in accordance with his standard practice and as recorded in the
    Consultation Report, he advised Ms. Rollin that if she experienced any
    difficulty with follow-up, she could book an appointment with him.  The strength of this evidence, he argues, is
    compelling particularly when compared with that of Ms. Rollin whose credibility
    was challenged in a number of ways including her having submitted inaccurate
    tax returns to Canada Revenue Agency and over-stating the effect her wrist
    difficulties are having on her life.</span></p>

    good historian who had a specific recollection of this major event in her
    life.  She weighed the evidence of each

    Rollin.  This task is squarely within the

    that the person to whom the case is being handed over is available, competent
    and able to deal with the problem”.   He submits
    that as a matter of policy the law should not place the responsibility on
    emergency room surgeons to personally ensure that patients have access to
    doctors properly trained to oversee after-care.  Mr. Curry submits that if such were the standard of care emergency room

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Clearly, in some cases, it will be necessary for
    the surgeon to write or to call and instruct or advise a physician in the
    community where the patient resides. In the case of very routine or minor
    surgery, communication may be completely unnecessary as the local physician
    will be very well aware of the steps he should take. In such circumstances, a
    simple direction to the patient to attend on his physician will suffice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What it really comes to is that the standard the
    court should fix for post-operative care must depend on all the circumstances
    surrounding the operation and the problems and needs of the particular patient.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The legal responsibility resting upon a medical
    practitioner in the care and treatment of his patients is rightly heavy and
    onerous. However, the standards of care imposed by the courts on the medical

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is generally accepted that when a doctor acts in
    accordance with a recognized and respectable practice of the profession, he or
    she will not be found to be negligent. This is because courts do not ordinarily
    have the expertise to tell professionals that they are not behaving
    appropriately in their field. In a sense, the medical profession as a whole is
    assumed to have adopted procedures which are in the best interests of patients
    and are not inherently negligent.</p>

    it is clear that the fracture was serious and that there was a high risk of
    displacement, a condition that could not be detected without x-ray.  For this reason, regular x-rays for several
    weeks following the surgery were imperative. The evidence also established that
    there was at least reason to be concerned about whether the patient’s family
    doctor would be equipped to handle the requirements of the after-care of a
    Colles’ fracture.  These factors support
    the trial judge’s determination of the standard of care to require more
    hands-on involvement by Dr. Baker.</span></p>

    the emergency room doctor to have direct contact with the family doctor’s
    office or to pursue one of the other options noted above, was rooted in her
    preference of the evidence of Dr. Mandel over that of Dr. McGoey on this
    issue.  This preference, as noted
    earlier, was based on the fact that Dr. Mandel was Ms. Rollin’s treating
    physician, while Dr. McGoey gave his opinion strictly on the basis of
    documents.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This, in my view, is where the trial judge erred - by
    preferring the evidence of Dr. Mandel on this issue based on an irrelevant
    ground.  In respect of this aspect of an
    emergency room doctor’s obligations to a patient with respect to after-care, I
    see no reason to prefer the evidence of one expert over that of another, solely
    on the basis that the former also treated the patient. No evidence was adduced
    to support such an approach.   Common
    sense does not support it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[74]<span

    error, this court is left with no clear evidence as to the standard practice
    with respect to the obligations of an emergency room doctor in terms of
    ensuring that the patient has access to a doctor, if needed, capable of
    performing the necessary steps to ensure optimal recovery, has no effect on the
    finding that Dr. Baker breached the standard of care in relation to after-care.
    I say this because, as I will explain, I would not interfere with the trial
    judge’s determination that Dr. Baker failed to give Ms. Rollin adequate
    information regarding the extent of her injury and her requirements for
    after-care.  This finding is sufficient
    to fix him with liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The essence of a physician’s duty is to ensure
    that the patient is adequately equipped to obtain her own after-care.  How this responsibility is to be met – the
    standard of care in the circumstances - will involve a mix of factors.  The first question that arises in this
    context is whether it is reasonable, in the circumstances of the particular
    patient and the particular required after-care procedures, for the doctor to
    leave the responsibility with the patient by informing the patient of the
    necessary steps to be taken and impressing upon her the importance of those
    steps.  Where the patient’s ability to
    follow instructions does not appear compromised and there is no doubt that a
    reasonable person could be expected to carry out the steps, the burden upon a
    physician with respect to follow-up, decreases.   In other words, the capable hands
    into which a patient must be placed can be, if the circumstances permit, her
    own.  As this court put it in <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Tacknyk</span></i><span style='line-height:200%'> at para. 26, “<span style='color:black'>A continuing duty
    rests upon the surgeon to provide adequate post-operative care <i>or to give adequate advice and direction as
    to such care</i>” (emphasis added).  </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second question that arises is whether it is
    reasonable for the doctor to assume that his or her sufficiently informed and presumably
    capable patient will be able to access adequate after-care without the doctor’s
    further involvement.  This does not mean
    that an emergency room surgeon has a responsibility to follow up innumerable
    patients, Mr. Curry suggests.  But<span
style='line-height:200%'> where the doctor should
    reasonably know that the patient cannot obtain care without the doctor’s
    further involvement, his duty is to put the patient into a position where she
    can.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It is this issue that, in my view, this court cannot resolve
    given the conflicting expert opinions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, Ms. Rollin has established that Dr.
    Baker failed to give her rudimentary information regarding the severity of her
    condition and the important steps to be taken concerning her after-care.  This failure deprived her of the tools
    necessary for her to obtain adequate care for herself.  The displacement could only be detected by
    having an x-ray taken: it was not something Ms. Rollin could detect <span
class=GramE>on her own</span>. Therefore, Dr. Baker’s failure to inform Ms.
    Rollin as to the seriousness of her fracture and the time-sensitive need for
    its monitoring makes his failure to ensure she was placed in the care of a
    competent doctor a breach of any reasonable standard of care.  Had he informed Ms. Rollin that it was
    important that she ensure that regular x-rays were taken over the first three
    weeks post-surgery due to the significant risk of displacement, perhaps he
    could have left the matter up to her, absent any indication that Ms. Rollin would
    have difficulty ensuring that her own health care needs were met.  But this he did not do. The responsibility
    for her sub-optimal healing therefore remains squarely on Dr. Baker’s shoulders
    so long as this failure can be shown to have caused her harm.    </p>

    that single sentence does not explain the basis of the amount, the trial
    judge’s unqualified review of how Ms. Rollin’s injured wrist has affected her
    life, plus her identification, in para. 14 of her reasons, of one of the issues
    before her as “the damages that Carole Rollin sustained as a result of the
    Colles’ fracture of her left wrist”, strongly suggest that the trial judge did assess
    damages as though Dr. Baker was responsible for all of the injuries his patient

  <h3>Juriansz J.A.  (Dissenting in Part):</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the reasons of Epstein J.A.
    dismissing the appeal challenging the trial judge’s findings in regard to the
    breach of the duty of care and factual and legal causation.  However, I take a different view of the
    appeal of the quantum of damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not agree that the trial judge's
    characterization of one of the issues before her as “the damages that Carole
    Rollin sustained as a result of the Colles’ fracture of her left wrist”
    strongly suggests that she assessed damages as though Dr. Baker was responsible
    for all of the damage that Ms. Rollin suffered as a result of her initial
    injury.  In my view, the trial judge's
    reasons read as a whole show that she was alive to her task of assessing the
    increased damage that resulted from Dr. Baker's negligence.  I refer to some of the passages from the
    trial judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At paragraph 218 the trial judge concluded, “Had
    Ms. <span class=GramE>Rollin</span> been followed up in a timely fashion by a
    practitioner that was familiar with the treatment of Colles’ fracture <i>her outcome would have been different</i>”
    (emphasis added).  The trial judge went
    on to indicate that the marked displacement, shortening, and loss of
    inclination observed by Dr. Mandel on July 25, 2002 were due to “the lack of
    appropriate follow up care in [a] timely fashion.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In paragraph 219 the trial judge found that “had
    Ms. Rollin seen Dr. Mandel earlier the treatment that she required may have
    been limited to a form of a repeat closed reduction and some form of
    pinning.  Instead, Ms. Rollin had to
    undergo three significant procedures.”  The trial judge set out the three significant procedures which she had
    in mind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Mandel's initial surgery of July 27, 2002 which
    was an open reduction with internal fixation using a right iliac crest bone
    graft. Secondly, a further surgery on April 16, 2003 which involved removing
    the hardware from the left wrist from the initial surgery and also doing an
    ulnar shortening osteotomy. Thirdly, she went on to have a surgery on August
    25, 2004 for the removal of the hardware utilized on the left ulnar shortening
    osteotomy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At paragraph 220 the trial judge accepted Dr.
    Mandel's evidence that had he seen the fracture earlier “it could have been
    treated much more simply for the patient.”  Because this did not take place, the trial judge found that “Ms. Rollin
    went through the various surgical procedures” set out above, and “had the level
    of pain and lack of movement that she did.”  This passage makes clear that the trial judge differentiated between the
    pain and lack of movement that may have resulted from a properly treated wrist
    fracture, and<i> the level</i> of pain and
    lack of movement suffered as a result of the negligence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also carefully considered other events that might have contributed
    to the severity and duration of Ms. Rollin's injury.  She concluded that the “swimming pool” and “pickle
    jar” incidents did not exacerbate her injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    paragraph 227 the trial judge concluded that Ms. <span class=GramE>Rollin’s</span> “outcome would have been better” absent Dr. Baker's negligence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    in paragraph 229, the trial judge specifically rejected the appellant’s
    argument that Ms. Rollin would have experienced much the same outcome in any
    event.  The trial judge said “[t]his is
    not a case wherein I can find that there was an unfortunate outcome that was
    not related to negligence.”  The trial judge
    went on to conclude that “but for the actions and lack of actions on the part
    of Dr. Baker, the outcome on this specific case would have been different.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    passages lead me to the view that while the trial judge could have posed the
    issue before her more clearly, her analysis does squarely focus on the
    different outcome that Ms. Rollin suffered as a result of the negligence.  This was not a case where the damages from
    negligence were but a component of what damages could be expected from a
    serious wrist fracture.  Rather, the
    negligence resulted in a different outcome and additional damage that would not
    have been suffered otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would not find that that the trial judge erred in her methodology of assessing
    damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Admittedly,
    the trial judge did not discuss in detail her assessment of non-pecuniary
    damages.  The brevity of her discussion
    of damages seems to reflect the way the case was argued at trial and the amount
    of emphasis the appellant had placed on the quantum of damages.  I gather this from the trial judge’s allusion
    to the submissions on damages made by the appellant’s trial counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event the trial judge adequately set out the basis of her assessment of
    damages in paragraphs 232-237.  Ms.
    Rollin was a vulnerable individual, working full-time in an employment of a
    primarily physical nature.  She was “capable,
    independent and ambitious”. She is left-hand dominant and the fracture was to
    the left wrist.  She continued to work
    after being absent for short periods after the first surgery and after the
    second surgery, but she never returned to her full complement of tasks at her
    employment.  Despite suffering multiple
    previous ailments, she never missed time away from work prior to this injury.
    After the injury she was ultimately unable to continue her employment.  Her wrist is permanently and visibly
    deformed.   As a result of the bone
    graft, which the trial judge found would not have been necessary but for the
    negligence, Ms. Rollin has suffered damage to her right iliac crest. She
    continues to have difficulties in the movement of her wrist and continues to
    experience pain, with the result that she can no longer perform basic functions
    without difficulty.  In this regard, the
    trial judge's earlier discussion indicates that she had in mind the increased “level”
    of pain and lack of movement Ms. Rollin suffers as a result of the negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    would I find that the quantum of damages was unreasonable.  I do not accept that general damage awards
    against defendants whose negligence has caused a plaintiff’s properly treated
    broken wrist to be the starting point in determining the range of damages due
    to the negligent treatment of a broken wrist.  In medical malpractice cases, intervening physicians’ negligence can
    cause damage that far exceeds what might ordinarily result from the underlying condition
    being treated.  Here, the trial judge
    found that the outcome was exacerbated by Dr. Baker’s negligence.  Of the cases cited by Epstein J.A. only two involve
    damages due to a physician’s negligence.  The damages that resulted in both <i>Hebert
    v. Stanley,</i> [1989] O.J. No. 14, and <i>Wilson
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Lewis </i>1994 <span class=SpellE>CarswellOnt</span> 2835, are far less than those that resulted in this case.  In <i>Hebert</i> there no further surgery was required.  In <i>Wilson</i> there was both a
    closed and an open reduction were required, but there was no bone graft, no
    resulting clinical abnormality, no deformity just a small residual scar, and a
    fairly good recovery. I see no basis to interfere with the quantum of damages
    awarded by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    conclusion, for the reasons given by Epstein J.A. in regard to liability and
    these reasons in regard to damages, I would dismiss the appeal entirely.  </p>
