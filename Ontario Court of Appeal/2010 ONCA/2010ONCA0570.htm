    pay his company a management fee of $200,000 if the concert realized a net
    profit (the management contract).  Molson
    and Vrozos also entered into an oral agreement under which Molson sold Vrozos
    the exclusive right to supply water at the concert (the Vrozos water contract).  Vrozos paid $120,000 for the water rights,
    which amount was to be set off against the contingent management fee of
    $200,000 payable to his company under the management contract.  The Vrozos water contract was reached by Vrozos
    and Bob Singleton (Singleton), Molsons then Vice President and General Manager. <span style='line-height:200%;'> </span></p>

    into a handwritten agreement, which was later typed and slightly altered, with the
    respondent Stephen Barber (Barber) under the terms of which Barber purchased
    Vrozoss water rights for the concert (the Wahta contract).  Pursuant to this agreement, Barber paid Vrozos
    $100,000 and agreed to pay additional fees based on the number of bottles sold.  In exchange, Barber obtained the exclusive
    right to supply, market, distribute and sell water at the concert, including
    the exclusive right to sell water at wholesale prices to other vendors.</span></p>

    sold at the concert would be Wahta water.  That was not what transpired, however.  At the concert, vendors sold water not </span>obtained through Wahta.  In addition, 650,000 bottles of Wahta water were

These included sales to Sports Caf&eacute; International and to Northwest Security for $3,744 and $1,872, respectively.  In addition, Vrozos sold 350,000 bottles of Wahta water to Molson for $28,000 so that Molson could meet the requirements imposed by the public health authorities.</span></p>

    emergency declared by EMS on the day of the concert, 300,000 bottles of Wahta
    water were distributed at the concert without charge.  In addition, the 350,000 bottles of Wahta

    to water sales and distribution, four other issues arose between Wahta and
    Vrozos.  First, after the concert, Vrozos
    went to the Wahta money-counting trailer and took $631,616 in cash.  When he was confronted the following day, he returned
    approximately $100,000 in coins.  He has
    never returned the balance of $478,000.  Second, Wahta paid Vrozos $20,000 to rent a hangar on site for the day
    of the concert.  The hangar was to have
    been used to house Wahta employees and store water products and supplies.
    Vrozos not only failed to rent the hangar, he did nothing in an attempt to rent
    the hangar.  On the night before the
    concert, Wahta was told by security personnel to vacate the hangar and its
    employees were forced to sleep in a field.  Wahta had to pay an additional $120,000 to its employees to ensure that
    they would stay and work during the concert.  Third, Vrozos told Wahta to rent trailers, ostensibly for Molsons use.  In fact, Vrozos used the trailers personally.  Wahta paid $8,900 to rent the trailers.  Fourth, Vrozos had Wahta rent gators for use
    at the concert.  He then rented the
    gators to Molson for $2,500 and kept the proceeds for himself. </span></p>

    the content of the Vrozos water contract.  Molson maintained that there were several conditions attached to that
    contract, including that Vrozos would be:  (i) the sole vendor entitled to have concession stands that sold water exclusively,
    (ii) the sole supplier of water to other vendors, provided he sold at fair
    market wholesale prices and was able to supply the quantity of water required,
    and (iii) responsible for meeting any water requirements imposed by public
    health authorities.  </span></p>

    these assertions.  He found that under
    the Vrozos water contract, Molson gave Vrozos exclusive water rights with no
    significant conditions, aside from a guarantee that water would be sold to
    concertgoers at stadium pricing, which the parties agreed was $3.00 per
    bottle.  </span></p>

    Molson was aware that Vrozos had sold these same rights to Wahta, and that
    Molson interfered in the economic relationship between Wahta and Vrozos in two
    ways.  First, Molson made an agreement
    with GMIC, allowing GMIC to sell water not purchased from Wahta.  Second, Molson foisted its obligation to
    supply water pursuant to the TPH/EMS requirements onto Wahta.  As a result of the TPH/EMS requirements, Wahta
    had over 3 million bottles on site, far more than it would have had otherwise
    (the excess water), and 650,000 bottles of Wahta water were given away for
    free.   </span></p>

    $632,000 in damages to Wahta as against Molson.  In respect of the GMIC agreement, he awarded $232,000 in damages for

    Paragon Blu for the sale of water in a barbecue area.  <span style='line-height:200%'>Third, Vrozos persuaded Wahta to rent gators and trailers,
    ostensibly for Molsons use.  Wahta paid

    compensation for the extra wages that Wahta was forced to pay its employees
    because of Vrozoss failure to provide a hangar.  Wahta needed to house its employees who were
    to work at the concert.  It asked Vrozos
    to arrange for a hangar to be used for that purpose.  Vrozos agreed and took a payment of $20,000
    from Wahta.  Vrozos did not arrange for a
    hangar.  In fact, the trial judge found
    that Vrozos made no attempt whatsoever to obtain the use of a hangar.  As a result, the Wahta employees had nowhere
    to stay.  They slept in the fields.  In order to entice the employees to stay and
    work during the concert and to compensate them for the inconvenience they

    matters is as follows.  Wahta gave Vrozos
    water to help Molson meet the TPH/EMS requirements.  Vrozos sold the water to Molson for $28,000
    and kept the money for himself.  Vrozos made
    deals in respect of water with Northwest Security and Sports Café International
    and retained the proceeds of those deals  $1,872 and $3,744 respectively.  As discussed above, $20,000 was the amount
    that Vrozos accepted from Wahta for rental of a hangar.  As has also been mentioned, Vrozos took no
    steps towards fulfilling that agreement.  </span><span style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>Finally, on the night of the concert, Vrozos went into Wahtas money
    counting trailer and took away a significant amount of the sale proceeds that
    Wahta employees had collected at the concert.  He returned a portion of the money when confronted the next day.  $478,000 is the balance that Vrozos never returned.  </span><span style='line-height:200%;'>The trial judge found that each of

    of Vrozos entitled Wahta to punitive damages.  After obtaining further submissions of the parties, he fixed the award
    of punitive damages at $50,000.  </span></p>

    essence of </span>Molsons appeal flows from its contention that like Wahta, it
    was a victim of Vrozoss wrongdoing.  Molson
    claims that it sold Vrozos water supply rights subject to conditions and
    limitations, and that Vrozos then fraudulently purported to sell the
    respondents unconditional and exclusive water rights, which he did not own.  Thereafter, Molson says, in a further fraud
    against Wahta, Vrozos sold water rights to several other vendors without
    disclosing those transactions to Wahta.  Molson
    says that because Vrozos is the wrongdoer and it is merely another of his
    victims, it should not be liable in damages to Wahta and, if it is, Vrozos
    should pay those damages by way of contribution and indemnity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wahta says that Molsons position cannot stand given
    the trial judges findings of fact.  We
    agree.  On the record, it was open to the
    trial judge to make those findings and we see no reason for this court to
    interfere with them.  Consequently, as we
    will explain, there is no basis on which to disturb the trial judges
    determination that Molson is liable to Wahta.  Although the trial judge did err in one part of the damage calculation,
    for the reasons given below, it is unnecessary to adjust the quantum of damages

    found by the trial judge, that Vrozos attempted to extort a settlement from
    Molson during the trial.  Vrozos arranged
    to meet with a Molson employee and told the employee that if Molson did not pay

    would be potentially embarrassing for Molson.  During cross examination, Vrozos admitted to these facts.  </p>

    understand the double recovery argument to be as follows.  As a result of the damage award against
    Vrozos, the respondents will make a net profit of $321,152.  Having made a profit, Molson argues that
    Wahta cannot be said to have suffered a loss, hence damages against Molson
    should be assessed at $0.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  This argument appears to
    confuse damages awarded for breach of contract with damages awarded for
    torts.  The fact that Wahta was
    compensated by a damage award against Vrozos for his breaches of their contract,
    does not preclude Wahta from recovering from Molson for the torts that Molson was
    found to have committed and which caused Wahta harm.  As explained above, the damages
    awarded against Molson were based on the trial judges determination that
    Molson had intentionally interfered in the respondents economic relations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[80]<span

    was no double recovery because the trial judge did not compensate Wahta twice
    for the same wrongdoing.  As we explain
    below, the damage award against Vrozos is largely to compensate Wahta for
    breaches of contract.  The damage award
    against Molson is to compensate Wahta for the harm it suffered as a result of
    the torts that Molson committed.   </p>

    calculated the expectation damages for the GMIC sales as $420,000:  the retail price ($2.50 per bottle) of
    168,000 bottles.  From this, he would
    have subtracted $20,000 as a rough estimate of the amount to which Vrozos was
    entitled, under the Wahta contract.  However, instead of awarding these expectation damages, the trial judge
    awarded what he characterised as reliance damages in the amount of </span>$232,000.  In arriving at this amount t<span

    the total income of $559,306.00 resulting in a net loss of $231,968.03.  H</span><span style='letter-spacing:-.05pt'>e
    rounded the figure to $232,000.00.  </span>It
    was an attempt by the trial judge to reflect an amount for the fact <span

    the <i>restitutio in integrum</i> principle,
    which requires the court to place the plaintiff, insofar as possible, in the
    position the plaintiff would have been had the tort not been committed.  </span></p>

    between the parties that Vrozos had attempted to negotiate a contract to sell
    water to GMIC, but that they had not agreed on a price.  It stands to reason that Wahta would
    similarly have been unable to come to an agreement as to price with GMIC.
    Consequently, Wahta would have sold its own water in the VIP area.  The correct quantum of damages is, therefore,
    the revenue that Wahta would have made had it sold water in the VIP area.  Thus, the quantum would have been 168,000
    bottles at $2.50 per bottle<a href="#_ftn8"

    been committed.  To fulfill the TPH/EMS
    requirements and in light of the trial judges findings on Wahtas exclusive
    rights in respect of the supply of water, Molson would have been required to
    purchase the water from Wahta.  Given the

    immediately after the concert, at a low price, on the basis that an immediate
    sale was preferable to incurring the costs of holding the water and hoping that
    it might be sold for a higher price at a later date.  The discounted prices that Wahta obtained
    were between $1.75 and $3.50 per case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Molson says that the trial judge did not rule on the
    question of mitigation of damages.  It
    recognizes that the labels on the Wahta bottles had been distorted as a result
    of condensation that formed on the bottles during the concert but argues that
    Wahta could have relabelled the water bottles (at a cost of $0.167 per case)
    and then resold them at market value (between $6.50 and $7.00 per case) instead
    of the discounted rate at which they were sold.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Molson bore the burden of proving that Wahta failed to
    take reasonable steps to mitigate its damages.  As stated by the Supreme Court in <i>Michaels

    C.H.S. Fifoot and M.P. Furmston, <i>Law of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he burden which lies on the defendant of proving

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wahta did mitigate its damages, albeit at discounted
    rates.  What Molson is really  arguing is that Wahta could have taken other
    or different steps and thereby mitigated to a greater extent.  To establish this, Molson had the burden of
    demonstrating that there were reasonable steps that Wahta could have taken to
    dispose of the excess water that would have earned it more than $1.75 to $3.50
    per case.  Molson points to evidence of
    the cost of relabeling the bottles in support of its submission.  In our view, this is not adequate to meet its
    burden.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The price of relabeling the bottles is only one aspect
    of the costs associated with Molsons suggested course of action.  Molson has pointed to no evidence with
    respect to other associated costs, including the costs of transporting,
    storing, and marketing the water nor has it led evidence to show that the steps
    that Wahta took were unreasonable, in the circumstances.  Consequently, Molson has not discharged its

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, we would dispose of Molsons three

    that the damage awards made at trial allow Wahta double recovery and that the
    trial judge erred in failing to deal with Wahtas duty to mitigate its losses.  We accept the second ground  that the trial

    letter from Molson to Vrozos.  In the
    first paragraph of the contract, the parties are described as Molson, Vrozoss
    numbered company and Vrozos himself.  Although
    only Molson and Vrozoss numbered company appear to have executed the contract,
    there are three signature lines in the contract.  The third signature line is for Vrozos
    personally.  These facts make it clear
    that the parties intended Vrozos to be a party to the management contract.  Further, they treated him as such.  Accordingly, it would appear that he had
    standing to enforce its terms.  However,

    be treated as revenue for the purposes of calculating net profits.  Put another way, since Vrozos had no right to
    veto Molsons promotional decision to give away tickets, he could not later

    expense.  In any event, there was no

    be interpreted  in the way that Vrozos contends for or as the trial judge did.  Both interpretations are available.  The strongest argument favouring Vrozoss interpretation
    is the word also in clause 5 of the agreement.  However, the structure of the Wahta contract favours
    the interpretation placed on it by the trial judge.  That is, clause 4 establishes an escalating
    scale of payments based on the numbers sold but the scale ends with a fee for
    the sale of 950,000.  What is to happen
    when sales exceed that?  Clause 5

    judge is to be preferred as it is consistent with the true intention of the
    parties and is more commercially reasonable.  In coming to this conclusion, we are guided by </span>the words of the
    Supreme Court in <i>Consolidated Bathurst
    Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    888, at p. 901:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>[T]he normal
    rules of construction lead a court to search for an interpretation which, from
    the whole of the contract, would appear to promote or advance the true intent
    of the parties at the time of entry into the contract</i>.  Consequently, literal meaning should not be
    applied where to do so would bring about an unrealistic result or a result
    which would not be contemplated in the commercial atmosphere in which the
    insurance was contracted.  <i>Where words may bear two constructions, the
    more reasonable one, that which produces a fair result, must certainly be taken
    as the interpretation which would promote the intention of the parties</i>.  Similarly, an interpretation which defeats
    the intention of the parties and their objective in entering into the
    commercial transaction in the first place should be discarded in favour of an
    interpretation of the policy which promotes a sensible commercial result.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What was the true intent of the parties?  Because the contract is ambiguous on its face
    (i.e. more than one interpretation is reasonably available), the court can
    consider extrinsic evidence in order to resolve the ambiguity.  That evidence shows that both Vrozos and
    Wahta estimated that concertgoers would consume approximately 1,000,000 to
    1,500,000 bottles of water.  Accordingly,
    it makes sense that they would have intended to provide for royalties if sales
    were to fall within that range.  On
    Vrozoss interpretation, there is nothing in the contract that reflects this
    intention.  The trial judges
    interpretation, however, is fully consonant with the parties intentions. <span

As Wahta points out, on Vrozos&rsquo;s interpretation, he would get double compensation for every bottle of water sold above 600,000.  To see how unfair and unreasonable this is, one has only to look at Vrozos&rsquo;s own calculations.  On those calculations, Wahta owes him hundreds of thousands of dollars above and beyond the initial $100,000 it paid him, despite having suffered enormous losses.  The trial judge&rsquo;s interpretation leads to a fair and reasonable result for both parties.  For the reasons given by the Supreme Court in Consolidated Bathurst, the trial judge&rsquo;s interpretation can be taken to best reflect the parties&rsquo; true intentions.  </span></p>

    the concert was over, Vrozos went into Wahtas money counting trailer and took
    the sale proceeds.  He put the money into
    his car and drove off.  He had no
    authorization for this.  The weight of
    the money was so great that apparently the rear end of Vrozoss car was barely
    off the ground, as he drove away.  When
    confronted the following day, Vrozos returned approximately $100,000 in coins
    to Wahta.  To date, he has not repaid
    $478,000, the balance of the money which he took that night.  Vrozos himself concedes these events took

    reason.  It will be recalled that this
    incident consisted of Wahta paying Vrozos $20,000 on the faith of his promise
    that he would obtain a hangar to house Wahta employees the night before the
    concert.  Vrozos did not do this 
    indeed, he took no steps whatsoever to rent the hangar  with the result that the
    Wahta employees were forced to spend the night in a field.  Wahta had to pay its employees an additional

    judge disbelieved Vrozos on the question of whether Vrozos had received the
    money from Pizza Pizza.  At para. 19(e)
    of the reasons, the trial judge states that Vrozos made a side agreement with
    Pizza Pizza allowing it to sell water on the site and <i>collected $10,000 from Pizza Pizza </i>without disclosure to the
    plaintiffs.  It is trite law that the
    trier of fact can believe some, none or all of a witnesss testimony.  The trial judge was entitled to disbelieve
    Vrozos on this point.  However, whether
    Vrozos received the payment from Pizza Pizza is irrelevant.  The agreement he reached on this matter with
    Barber was not made conditional on Vrozos receiving the money from Pizza Pizza.  Accordingly, Vrozos owes Wahta $10,000 for his
    breach of contract flowing from his deal with Pizza Pizza.    </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>Second, with respect to the
    Paragon Blu deal, Vrozos argues that it was a political concession based on a
    request by Dennis Mills to allow Paragon Blu to sell water at wholesale prices
    to barbecue vendors.  Vrozos argues that
    Montour agreed to this deal on behalf of Wahta.  However, the trial judge found that this was untrue.  Vrozos argues that this was not open to the
    trial judge because there was no evidence to contradict his testimony.  </span></p>

It will be recalled that the third component related to the $8,900 that Wahta paid to rent trailers used personally by Vrozos, and the gators, procured by Wahta, which Vrozos rented to Molson for $2,500.  In the circumstances, a figure of $10,000 is adequate compensation to Wahta.</span></p>

    remains, albeit for breach of contract rather than the tort of intentional
    interference with economic relations.  The existing damage award of $531,616 for breaches of contract must be
    increased to $635,366 to allow for damages of $10,000 and $93,750, in respect
    of the Pizza Pizza and Paragon Blu deals.  Accordingly, the total damage award (excluding punitive damages) against
    Vrozos is $765,366, plus prejudgment interest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Unlike the Molson
    claim in respect of damages, the increase in damage award against Vrozos is
    warranted despite the absence of a cross appeal.  Vrozos raised the issue of the quantification
    of damages and asked that damages be set on the basis of contractual
    principles.  We accepted that argument
    and corrected the quantum accordingly.  As Vrozos got what he asked for, he cannot now be heard to complain
    about the result.    </p>

    made clear that such a power imbalance between the parties is not a necessary
    pre-condition to an award of punitive damages.  Thus, punitive damages have been awarded in cases of libel and slander (<i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto</i>,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An award of punitive damages therefore requires the
    defendant to have engaged in extreme misconduct.  The type of conduct required to attract
    punitive damages has been described in many ways, such as:  malicious, oppressive, arbitrary and
    high-handed that offends the courts sense of decency... a marked departure
    from ordinary standards of decent behaviour... harsh, vindictive, reprehensible
    and malicious... offends the ordinary standards of morality and decency...
    arrogant and callous... egregious... high-handed and callous... arrogant,
    callous of the plaintiffs rights and deliberate... outrageous or extreme...

    to show that the defendants conduct meets one or several of the above
    adjectives.  Rather, the analysis must
    focus on whether the conduct in question is so serious that it engages the
    policy goals that underlie punitive damages: [T]o give a defendant his or her just desert (retribution), to deter
    the defendant and others from similar misconduct in the future (deterrence),
    and to mark the communitys collective condemnation (denunciation) of what has
