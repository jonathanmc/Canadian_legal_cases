  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view the Board’s decision was not unreasonable and was amply
    supported on the record.  Nor do we see any error in law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, we do not accept that this is a “treatment impasse” situation, as
    Mr. O’Donnell, happily, is reported to be making some progress, and his current
    treatment program involving Lupron is still very much a work in progress, but
    showing positive results.  Given his characteristic ambivalence, any more
    concrete treatment plan would be difficult to devise at this stage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the Board did not fail in its duty of inquiry, in our view. 
    There was ample evidence to support its conclusion that Mr. O’Donnell was not
    yet ready for transfer to a medium security facility, and the Board did not
    rely on the administrator’s letter from the Centre for Addiction and Mental
    Health (CAMH) and Ontario Shores as dispositive in that regard, but rather
    relied on the record as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the Board did not err in failing to give effect to Mr.
    O’Donnell’s liberty interests.  It expressly considered this issue and
    concluded, as it was reasonably entitled to do on the evidence, that Mr.
    O’Donnell’s liberty interests are currently less restricted at Oak Ridge –
    given the various privileges he enjoys – than would be the case were he
    transferred to a medium security facility where, because of the risk to others
    he poses, he would likely be confined to his ward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, although there may be something to be said for obtaining a more
    recent and up-to-date formal assessment done in a maximum security environment,
    we cannot say that the Board’s decision not to order an independent assessment
    in a medium security institution was unreasonable, given their view that it was
    unnecessary, on the evidence, and, particularly, that the risk such an exercise
    would create for other vulnerable patients in such an institution was too
    great.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. O’Donnell asked that his mother, grandmother and uncle be removed
    from his no-contact list.  They have provided revocable consents that he may contact
    them.  We think it best to leave this up to the family members.  As the Board
    noted, the family members were not canvassed about this deletion, and the
    evidence was that the no-contact provision is in place to assist family members
    and other victims and that the provision does not interfere with his treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
