  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a December morning in 2001, Natalie Frank was driving to work in the
    southbound lane of Highbury Avenue in the Municipality of Central Elgin.  She
    hit an icy patch on the road, lost control of her car and collided with an
    oncoming truck.  Sadly, she suffered a serious head injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Frank sued Central Elgin for negligence for failing to maintain
    Highbury Avenue in a reasonable state of repair.  After a four-day trial Hockin
    J. dismissed the action.  He found that Central Elgin had adequately salted
    Highbury Avenue shortly before the accident occurred, but that light blowing
    snow had delayed the salt’s effectiveness.  He concluded that Central Elgin had
    met the applicable standard of care because it had done all that could
    reasonably be required of it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Ms. Frank’s overall position is that the trial judge erred in
    finding that Central Elgin had met the standard of care.  In support of that
    position, she makes two main submissions on her appeal.  First, she submits that
    the trial judge erred in holding that the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue
    was adequately salted.  Second, she submits that the road conditions on the
    southbound lane of Highbury Avenue the morning of the accident were highly
    dangerous, and required Central Elgin to do more than it did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.  The trial
    judge’s findings of fact and his conclusion that Central Elgin met the standard
    of care required of it are well supported in the record.  Appellate
    intervention is not justified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before dealing with Ms. Frank’s two submissions, I will discuss the duty
    of care and standard of care imposed on a municipality, the steps Central Elgin
    took to meet the standard of care, and the trial judge’s findings.  </p>
  <h4>(2)       The statutory duty and standard of care imposed on a municipality</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2001, Central Elgin’s duty of repair and the standard of care
    required of it were codified in s. 284(1) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. M. 45, since repealed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>284(1)             The council of the corporation
    that has jurisdiction over a highway or bridge shall keep it in a state of
    repair that is reasonable in light of all the circumstances, including the
    character and location of the highway or bridge.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1.1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    case of default, the corporation, subject to the <i>Negligence Act</i>, is
    liable for all damages any person sustains because of the default.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1.3) The corporation is not liable under
    subsection (1) or (1.1) for failing to keep a highway or bridge in a reasonable
    state of repair if it took reasonable steps to prevent the default from
    arising.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Duty of care</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judicial interpretation of s. 284 and similar statutory provisions has
    held that the act does not impose on a municipality a duty to repair every
    adverse road condition.  In the winter, for example, a municipality’s failure
    to salt or sand its roads does not automatically expose it to civil liability. 
    The driving public cannot expect municipalities to keep the roads free and
    clear of snow and ice at all times during the winter.  Courts have recognized
    that although motorists ought to be kept reasonably safe during winter driving
    conditions, municipalities ought not to be turned into insurers of the safety
    of the driving public by imposing overly onerous maintenance obligations.  See <i>Brown
    v. British Columbia</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 420 at 439.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What winter conditions do impose a duty of repair on municipalities?  In <i>R. v. Coté</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 595 at 603, the Supreme Court of Canada
    confined a provincial or municipal authority’s duty or repair narrowly to road
    conditions that created “a highly dangerous situation at a certain location in
    the highway, which otherwise, to persons using the same, was quite passable and
    usable for traffic.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For some years after <i>Coté</i>, this court held that the narrow test
    in <i>Coté</i> was the sole test for determining when a municipality had a duty
    to repair winter road conditions.  For example, in <i>Simms v. Metropolitan
    Toronto (Municipality)</i> (1978), 28 O.R. (2d) 606, this court rejected the
    argument that a municipality may have a duty to salt and sand the roads in
    response to generalized icy conditions.  In this court’s view that argument
    stated the municipality’s duty too broadly.  Instead, relying on <i>Coté</i>,
    this court confined the municipality’s duty to a “high special dangerous
    situation at a certain location in the highway.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gradually, however, courts began to recognize that a municipality may
    also have a duty to repair widespread or general ice and snow conditions within
    its jurisdiction.  The general negligence standard applies.  A municipality’s
    duty of repair arises not just in a “highly special dangerous situation at a
    certain location in the highway” but in any situation where road conditions
    create an unreasonable risk of harm to users of the highway.  The former is
    simply a subset of the latter.  See, for example, <i>Gould v. County of Perth</i> (1983), 42 O.R. (2d) 548 (H.C.J.), aff’d (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 120 (C.A.); <i>Thornhill
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Shadid</i> (2008), 289 D.L.R. (4th) 396 (Ont.
    S.C.);  <i>Roberts v. Morana</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 647 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)),
    aff’d (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 157 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In some civil actions against a municipality, there is a serious issue
    whether the road conditions complained of triggered the municipality’s duty of
    repair, that is, whether the road conditions gave rise to an unreasonable risk
    of harm.  That is not the case here.  As I will discuss, the trial judge
    accepted (without deciding) that Central Elgin had a duty the morning of the
    accident to keep Highbury Avenue in a reasonable state of repair.  The only
    issue at trial was whether it fulfilled its duty, that is, whether it met the
    standard of care required of it.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)       Standard of care</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where winter road conditions give rise to an
    unreasonable risk of harm, a municipality must show that it took reasonable
    steps to eliminate or reduce the danger within a reasonable time after it
    became aware of the danger.  Consistent with the statute, the standard is
    reasonableness, not perfection.  If a municipality fails to meet this
    reasonableness standard, then it may be held liable for breach of its duty of
    repair.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Of course, the reasonableness of a
    municipality’s response to potentially dangerous road conditions must be
    measured against the nature of the risk.  Highly dangerous situations may
    require the municipality to do more than it would be required to do in other
    situations giving rise to an unreasonable risk of harm.  The reasonableness of
    Central Elgin’s response to the icy conditions on the southbound lane of
    Highbury Avenue the morning the accident occurred lies at the heart of this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(3)       Weather
    and road conditions in Central Elgin the morning of the accident (December 21,
    2001)</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>December 21, 2001 was a cold morning in southwestern Ontario, with temperatures
    about 3 to 4 degrees below zero.  It was also windy, and the wind was blowing
    light snow across the roads.  Many of the roads were clear, though wet, but
    some, including Highbury Avenue, had patches of light snow across both lanes. 
    It was a typical winter day in southern Canada.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(4)       The steps taken by Central Elgin</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early in the morning of December 21, 2001, Joe Livingston, Central
    Elgin’s operations superintendent at the time, began to inspect Central Elgin’s
    roads.  At about 5:22 a.m. he patrolled Highbury Avenue.  He observed that some
    stretches of Highbury Avenue had light snow in both the northbound and
    southbound lanes.  He recognized that this snow could turn to ice if the
    morning traffic melted the snow and it later froze.  Having recognized this
    danger, at 5:30 a.m. Mr. Livingston ordered three salt trucks to salt Highbury
    Avenue and any other roads in the north part of Central Elgin.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central Elgin’s salt trucks had specific routes assigned to them.  The
    route assigned to truck 40 included Highbury Avenue and stipulated that
    Highbury Avenue was a priority road to be salted first.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cliff Carrothers, an operator with 16 years’ experience, was assigned to
    truck 40 that morning.  He left Central Elgin’s operations yard in truck 40 at
    6:15 a.m.  His truck, like all of Central Elgin’s salt trucks, had standard
    salting equipment used by municipalities across Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Mr. Carrothers’ truck was calibrated to drop salt at the rate of 130
    kilograms per kilometre of highway.  This rate was the standard rate used by
    municipalities in Ontario in winter.  Once dropped on the road, the salt forms
    a brine solution, which lowers the freezing point of ice that it comes into
    contact with.  In winter storm conditions, the practice was to drop salt at the
    rate of 160 kilograms per kilometre.  But there was no winter storm in Central
    Elgin that morning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Carrothers drove immediately to Highbury Avenue.  He testified that
    he applied salt to the northbound lane of Highbury Avenue, turned around at the
    northern boundary of Central Elgin’s jurisdiction, then salted the southbound
    lane.  To ensure that salt was evenly distributed on the road Mr. Carrothers
    drove the truck at 50 kilometres per hour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Carrothers testified that he completed salting the northbound and
    southbound lanes of Highbury Avenue between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m.  He then went to
    salt other roads on his route.  He testified that as he was salting the
    southbound lane of Highbury Avenue, he noticed snow drifting onto the road. 
    Because of this observation, Mr. Carrothers said that after completing his
    route he had intended to return to Highbury Avenue to check on the condition of
    the road.  Before finishing his route, however, he was told that an accident
    had occurred on Highbury Avenue.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(5)       The accident</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accident occurred about 7:50 a.m.  Ms. Frank was driving in the
    southbound lane of Highbury Avenue.  It was rush hour and the traffic was
    heavy.  She was driving at or below the speed limit.  When her car hit the icy
    patch, she veered into the northbound lane, resulting in the collision. 
    Central Elgin did not allege that she was driving negligently.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(6)       The trial and the findings of the
    trial judge</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Frank’s principal argument at trial was that Mr. Carrothers did not
    salt the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue.  She pointed out that when the
    accident occurred, the northbound lane of Highbury Avenue was clear but the
    southbound lane was slushy with icy patches.  Alternatively, Ms. Frank argued
    that the southbound lane had been inadequately salted.  She therefore submitted
    that Central Elgin had not taken reasonable steps to keep the southbound lane
    of Highbury Avenue in a reasonable state of repair the morning of December 21,
    2001.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the trial judge accepted, without deciding, that Central
    Elgin had a duty of repair.  In effect, he accepted that the road conditions on
    Highbury Avenue and on other streets in the north part of the municipality the
    morning of the accident created an unreasonable risk of harm, requiring Central
    Elgin to take remedial action.  He analyzed the case by assuming, as Ms. Frank
    had contended, that Central Elgin had an obligation to salt Highbury Avenue. 
    He, therefore, had only to decide the factual questions whether Central Elgin
    had salted the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue, and if so whether the
    salting was “timely and reasonably executed.”  He set out his task at para. 28
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am not required in this case to decide whether,
    in law, there was an obligation on Central Elgin to salt Highbury Avenue.  In
    the weather conditions which were present the morning of December 21, 2001,
    Central Elgin’s patrol man called for a salt truck.  This was a matter of good
    practice for the municipality; it was obliged to do so under its road standards
    by-law and the Ontario Good Roads Association standard; and it was the
    reasonable thing to do for a high volume road which connected London and St.
    Thomas when there was a foreseeable risk of ice.  The only issue for me is an
    issue of fact: was the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue salted, and if it
    was, whether the salting was timely and reasonably executed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the evidence the trial judge concluded that Central
    Elgin was not negligent, that the steps it had taken were reasonable and
    executed properly – in short, Central Elgin had done “all that should
    reasonably be required of it” (para. 33).  In reaching this conclusion, the
    trial judge made three important findings of fact, each of which was well
    supported in the record, and grounded in the trial judge’s credibility findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he found that Mr. Carrothers had salted both the northbound and the
    southbound lane of Highbury Avenue.  This finding was fully justified.  Mr.
    Carrothers testified that he salted both lanes.  On cross-examination, Ms.
    Frank’s counsel did not put to him that he did not salt the southbound lane or
    that he salted the southbound lane improperly.  Indeed, he was not
    cross-examined on the route that he took or on his application of salt.  Mr.
    Carrothers’ evidence stood unchallenged because Ms. Frank called no
    contradictory testimony.  (Jeff Udall, Ms. Frank’s expert, initially gave the
    opinion that the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue was not salted.  His
    opinion was entirely undermined by his misunderstanding of how salt trucks
    operated and his mistaken assumption that little or no wind was blowing at the
    time of the accident).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Michael Hare, the only other witness who testified about the
    salting of the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue, corroborated the evidence of
    Mr. Carrothers.  Mr. Hare was Central Elgin’s operations superintendent at the
    time of trial.  He arrived at the scene of the accident shortly after 8:00
    a.m.  He said that he looked at the southbound lane.  He testified that he
    “felt that the road had been salted.”  He also testified that by the time he
    left the accident scene the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue was clear of
    ice: it was “pretty well bare.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s finding that the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue was
    salted effectively disposed of Ms. Frank’s main argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s second finding disposed of Ms. Frank’s alternative
    argument, that the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue was inadequately salted. 
    The trial judge found that “the concentration of salt was the correct
    concentration.”  This finding, too, was fully justified on the record before
    the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Carrothers testified that he applied salt at the rate of 130
    kilograms per kilometre and that he drove at 50 kilometres per hour so that the
    salt would be distributed evenly.  The rate at which Mr. Carrothers deposited
    the salt on Highbury Avenue followed the standard practice in Central Elgin and
    other municipalities across Ontario for these road conditions.   This rate also
    complied with the standard mandated by the Ontario Good Roads Association and
    Central Elgin’s own winter maintenance by-law.  No evidence was led at trial to
    suggest that this standard was itself negligent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Carrothers’ testimony that he salted Highbury Avenue at the standard
    rate followed across Ontario is supported by Central Elgin’s salting records
    for the day.  According to those records, truck 40, which Mr. Carrothers drove,
    had 23,800 pounds of salt when he started out and 7,800 pounds left when he
    completed his route.  Therefore, he applied 16,000 pounds of salt.  The
    evidence disclosed that his route was between 40 and 42.5 kilometres.  A salt
    deposit of 130 kilogram per kilometre would yield a total deposit for the route
    of between 5,200 and 5,525 kilograms of salt, or between 11,440 and 12,155
    pounds of salt (1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds).  Mr. Carrothers, then, applied more
    salt than the standard rate required him to.  Indeed, Mr. Hare testified that
    he would have expected Mr. Carrothers to have used only half his load – between
    12,000 and 13,000 pounds of salt.  He used much more than that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial judge found that the salt “was applied in time to work
    but its effectiveness was diminished greatly by the deposit of snow over the
    brine solution from the drifting condition which existed at the time” (para.
    32).  This finding explained the evidence that the northbound lane of Highbury
    Avenue was clear, while the southbound lane had icy patches.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This finding drew support from the two experts called at trial, Jeff
    Udall for Ms. Frank and Brian Malone for Central Elgin.  Mr. Malone explained
    that usually a brine solution created by salt deposited on the road will have
    its full effect within 30 minutes.  However, even a light amount of drifting or
    blowing snow can produce a layer of snow or ice over the brine solution and
    delay the breaking up of the ice.  Mr. Udall essentially agreed with Mr.
    Malone’s explanation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Malone’s explanation was supported by the eye witness evidence of
    Mr. Hare, who, as I said earlier, testified that by the time he left the scene
    of the accident the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue was pretty well bare. 
    Indeed, the evidence at trial was that not all of the southbound lane of
    Highbury Avenue was a sheet of ice when the accident occurred.  Some parts of
    it were clear.   In other parts, the salt was taking a little longer to work
    because of the light blowing snow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accident apparently occurred at one of those spots on the road where
    the light blowing snow created icy patches and delayed the salt’s
    effectiveness.  However, on the basis of these three findings, the trial judge
    concluded that Central Elgin was not negligent.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> ISSUES</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(1)       Did
    the trial judge err in holding that the southbound lane of
  Highbury Avenue was adequately salted?</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Ms. Frank conceded that the trial judge had correctly stated
    the duty and standard of care imposed on Central Elgin.  She submitted,
    however, that he had applied the standard of care incorrectly.  She argued that
    the trial judge’s finding that the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue was
    adequately salted the morning of the accident was an unreasonable one.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Frank’s argument runs up against the trial judge’s key findings of
    fact, which I discussed above: Mr. Carrothers salted the southbound lane of
    Highbury Avenue and applied the correct amount of salt.  These findings were made
    on largely uncontradicted evidence, and on the trial judge’s assessment of the
    credibility of the witnesses.  There is no basis in the record to revisit these
    findings on appeal and therefore, in my judgment, no basis to set aside the
    trial judge’s decision on the basis that his holding was unreasonable.</p>
  <h3>(2)       Did the trial
    judge err in finding that Central Elgin met the standard of care because he
    failed to characterize the road conditions on Highbury Avenue as highly
    dangerous?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Central Elgin had met its duty of repair: it
    had done all the morning of the accident that could reasonably be required of
    it.  That finding is entitled to deference from this court.  Nonetheless, Ms.
    Frank submits the trial judge erred in making this finding because he failed to
    appreciate that the road conditions in the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue
    that morning created – in the words of <i>Coté</i> – “a highly special
    dangerous situation.”  Had the trial judge characterized the road conditions in
    that way, Ms. Frank asserts, he would have been bound to find that Central
    Elgin had not met the standard of care required of it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In three relatively recent decisions – two of which Ms. Frank referred
    to – this court held that a municipal or provincial authority had a duty of
    repair and then imposed liability for failing to meet the standard of care,
    that is, failing to take reasonable steps to address a “highly special dangerous
    situation at a certain location” it knew or ought to have known required
    special attention:  see <i>Montani v. Matthews</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 257,
    leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 395; <i>Bisoukis v.
    Brampton (City)</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 417, leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 52; <i>MacMillan v. Ontario (Minister of
    Transportation and Communications)</i> (2001), 24 M.V.R. (4th) 15, leave to
    appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 348.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not characterize the road conditions on Highbury
    Avenue that morning as giving rise to a “highly special dangerous situation.”  And
    Central Elgin disputes this characterization, maintaining that the road
    conditions were simply typical of a winter day in southern Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think it is necessary to decide whether the conditions at least
    in the southbound lane of Highbury Avenue should have been characterized as
    giving rise to a highly special dangerous situation.  Even if they should have
    been so characterized, the trial judge’s finding that Central Elgin did all
    that could reasonably be required of it is well supported in the record.  I
    would defer to this finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deference to the trial judge’s finding is justified both because of the
    steps Central Elgin did take that morning to keep the road conditions on
    Highbury Avenue in a reasonable state of repair, and because of the contrast
    between what Central Elgin did and the municipal or provincial authority did
    (or did not do) in <i>Coté</i> and the three cases from this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the steps Central Elgin did take the morning the accident
    occurred.  The critical steps that justify deference to the trial judge’s
    finding are the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Central Elgin’s operations superintendent patrolled and inspected
    the roads very early in the morning on December 21, 2001;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He recognized the potential for icy conditions and called out the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

    high priority road;</p>

    salted it first before salting any other roads on his route;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By 7:00 a.m. he had salted both the northbound and southbound

    Ontario and mandated by the Ontario Good Roads Association;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He planned to come back to Highbury Avenue to check on its
    condition after he had salted the other roads on his route.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the accident intervened because the light blowing snow
    delayed the salt’s effectiveness.  A municipality, however, cannot be expected
    to deal with every contingency.  The steps that I have outlined support the
    trial’s judge’s finding that Central Elgin met the reasonableness standard of
    care.  Moreover, the contrast between what it did and what was not done in the
    four cases where the provincial or municipal authority was found liable further
    support the trial judge’s finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Coté</i>, the Ontario Department of Highways was found
    contributorily negligent because it neither inspected nor patrolled the highway
    where the accident occurred and let a “treacherous, slippery and dangerous” icy
    condition continue for several hours.  Here, very early in the morning Central
    Elgin patrolled and inspected Highbury Avenue, by 5:30 a.m. ordered that
    Highbury Avenue be salted, designated Highbury Avenue a high priority road to
    be salted first, and had both lanes salted by 7:00 a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>MacMillan</i>, this court found the Ministry liable because
    although it knew or ought to have known about the risk of preferential icing on
    a bridge, it did nothing.  The Ministry did not think it had any duty of repair,
    and therefore neither inspected nor salted the bridge.  The contrast between
    what the Ministry did not do in that case and what Central Elgin did do in this
    case is striking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Montani</i>, an accident occurred on black ice on a bridge one
    January morning about 11:30 a.m.  The Ministry had salted and sanded the bridge
    at 8:00 a.m. but did no further salting or sanding after that time.  A majority
    of this court held the Ministry liable for failing to salt or sand in the
    intervening three and a half hours.  Here, Mr. Carrothers salted Highbury
    Avenue by 7:00 a.m. and planned to check on its condition after salting the
    other roads on his route.  The accident occurred within an hour after he had
    salted, not over three and a half hours later as occurred in the <i>Montani</i> case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in <i>Bisoukis</i>, the plaintiff, while driving home from work
    on a well traveled road, lost control of her car on black ice and was injured. 
    The city had last inspected the road two days before the accident and last
    sanded it the day before the accident.  This court found that the city had a
    duty of repair, which it had breached because it failed to inspect or salt the
    road the day the accident occurred.  Here, of course, Central Elgin inspected
    Highbury Avenue and then salted it less than an hour before the accident took
    place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What separates <i>Coté</i>, <i>MacMillan</i>, <i>Montani</i> and <i>Bisoukis</i> from this case is that in all four of those cases, on the day of the accident,
    the authority either took no remedial action or waited hours before taking remedial
    action; here, on the day of the accident, Central Elgin took remedial action,
    and did so promptly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still, Ms. Frank maintains that “something more was required.”  She
    asserts that Mr. Carrothers should have done a second salting on Highbury
    Avenue right away or that Central Elgin should have applied more salt because
    it knew or ought to have known that salting at the standard rate – 130
    kilograms per kilometre – would be ineffective.  Respectfully, these assertions
    are contrary to the evidence led at trial and to the trial judge’s finding of
    fact that the correct amount of salt was applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Carrothers testified that he had to give the salt he did deposit
    time to work and that he did not immediately do a second salting on Highbury
    Avenue because he had other roads to salt lest accidents occur on those roads. 
    And, for the road conditions that existed in Central Elgin that morning, the
    municipality applied salt at the rate used by every other municipality in
    Ontario and approved by the Ontario Good Roads Association.  The higher rate of
    160 kilograms per kilometre was reserved for winter storm conditions, but there
    was no winter storm in Central Elgin that morning.  Ms. Frank did not lead any
    evidence to challenge these rates or to show that salting at a higher rate that
    morning would have been more effective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The salt Mr. Carrothers applied on the southbound lane of Highbury
    Avenue was working to break up the ice.  On Mr. Hare’s evidence, without the
    light blowing snow, the southbound lane likely would have been clear of ice by
    7:30 a.m.  As best I can tell from the record, the light blowing snow delayed
    the salt’s effectiveness by about 45 minutes, perhaps as long as an hour.  The
    accident occurred in that 45 to 60 minute timeframe.  The municipality is not
    an insurer and it is not held to a standard of perfection.  Thus, whether road
    conditions that morning are characterized as creating an unreasonable risk of
    harm or a “highly special dangerous situation,” I see no basis to disturb the
    trial judge’s finding that Central Elgin did all that could reasonably be
    required of it, and therefore was not negligent.  I would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central Elgin is entitled to its costs of the appeal in the amount
