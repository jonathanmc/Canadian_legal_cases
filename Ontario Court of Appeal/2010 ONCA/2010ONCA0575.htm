lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent pleaded guilty to possession of
    child pornography and Internet child luring.  He possessed images on his
    computer and had used an internet chat room to lure what he believed to be a
    12-year-old girl and her 13-year-old friend to meet him to engage in sexual
    acts.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He was sentenced to 45 days imprisonment in
    addition to two days of pretrial custody for the child pornography conviction
    and a 12-month conditional sentence for the Internet child luring conviction to
    be served consecutively, followed by three years probation.  The Crown seeks
    leave to appeal the sentence for the luring conviction, and submits that a
    sentence of 18 months imprisonment would have been appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge recognized the gravity of
    the offence.  Over a period of three days, the respondent had engaged in an
    online chat with an undercover police officer posing as a 12-year-old girl.  The
    respondent claimed to be 17 years of age.  During the chats he became
    increasingly sexually explicit.  He masturbated in front of a web camera during
    one of these chats.  He arranged to have sexual intercourse with the
    12-year-old girl and a three-way sexual encounter with her and her 13-year-old
    girlfriend.  He was arrested when he went to meet the girls as arranged.  </span>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge stressed that both the
    possession of child pornography and Internet child luring were serious
    offences.  She noted that Parliament had provided a mandatory minimum sentence
    for possession of child pornography and had increased the maximum sentence for
    Internet child luring from five years to ten years to reflect the seriousness
    of the offences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge viewed the two counts,
    though discrete, as interrelated.  She noted that the two offences arose out of
    the same circumstances and should be dealt with together.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge refused a defence request
    to allow the respondent to serve the 45-day sentence on the child pornography conviction
    intermittently, saying an intermittent sentence would be “inadequate to address
    denunciation, general deterrence and specific deterrence.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge set out what she viewed as
    mitigating factors.  The respondent was young: 24 years of age at the time of
    sentencing.  He had a strict upbringing and was sexually victimized himself. 
    He had no prior criminal record.  He entered guilty pleas.  He was married with
    a young child and had the support of his wife and father-in-law.  He did not
    have an entrenched interest in child pornography or sex with children.  He was
    capable of rehabilitation and appeared willing to commit to counseling and therapy. 
    At the time of sentencing, the respondent was attending therapy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge described the gravity of
    the offence of Internet child luring.  She stated that Internet child luring “must
    be dealt with seriously by the Courts.  Children are vulnerable to the
    predatory actions of those who enter chatrooms to lure them into situations
    where they can be sexually exploited.”  The sentencing judge recognized that
    the primary sentencing principles that applied were those of denunciation and
    general deterrence.  However, she added, one should not lose sight of the
    principle of rehabilitation. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge also recognized that conditional
    sentences for the offence of Internet child luring should only be imposed in rare
    cases.  She acknowledged that this was not one of “the rarest of cases” and
    that “the circumstances of this accused are not unusual”.  She further recognized
    that the standard range for Internet child luring cases is 12 months to two
    years’ imprisonment.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nevertheless, she went on to impose a
    conditional sentence of 12 months under house arrest.  She noted that the
    accused had been diligent in pursuing his education, that he had sought out and
    maintained employment, that he had a young family, and that he was actively
    engaged in counseling.  She concluded that a conditional sentence would
    severely restrict his liberty while permitting him to pursue his education and
    counseling and to support his family.  She was satisfied that the respondent
    would pose a minimal risk to the safety of the community while serving a
    conditional sentence under house arrest with a term prohibiting him from using
    a computer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the sentencing judge erred in principle by
    placing undue emphasis on the respondent’s rehabilitation and failing to accord
    sufficient weight to the principles of denunciation and deterrence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In finding that, in the particular case before her, the denunciation and
    general deterrence factors could be satisfied with a conditional sentence, the
    trial judge proceeded in the manner indicated by this court in <i>R. v. Folino</i> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 641.  In that case, the trial judge imposed a nine-month
    jail term for Internet luring.  McMurtry C.J.O., writing for the court, found
    that the judge had “overemphasized the punitive sentencing objectives of denunciation
    and deterrence and failed to consider the restorative objectives of
    rehabilitation, reparations and promotion of a sense of responsibility.”  The
    court replaced the sentence of nine months’ incarceration with a conditional
    sentence of 18 months.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither the facts of the offence nor the circumstances of the accused in <i>Folino</i> were markedly different from those of this case.  If anything,
    the luring in that case was more egregious.  Folino engaged in live Internet chats
    and email exchanges with an undercover police officer posing as “Jessie”, a 13-
    year old girl, over a period of three weeks.  The chat sessions were sexually
    explicit.  Folino repeatedly suggested that they should find a private place to
    meet and asked what kinds of sexual acts “Jessie” would perform on him.  During
    one chat session, he noted “Jessie’s” young age and acknowledged that he could
    get into trouble.  In another session, he suggested that she penetrate herself
    digitally to prepare for their meeting.  He sent her a picture of himself and a
    picture of a penis in further preparation for their meeting.  Finally, he made
    arrangements to meet her, telling her not to wear a bra or underpants to
    facilitate the various sexual acts he would perform on her, including
    cunnilingus, and that he expected her to perform sexual acts on him, including
    fellatio.  He was arrested after he had driven 22 kilometres to the
    pre-arranged meeting spot. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like the respondent in this case, Folino had no prior criminal record. 
    He was employed whereas the respondent was working part-time while pursuing his
    education.  Both Folino and the respondent had supportive families, were
    participating in therapy and counselling and presented a low risk of
    re-offending.  Folino, at 35 years of age, was ten years older than this
    accused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only significant difference is that in this case, there was no
    evidence that the respondent would be imperilled by incarceration. In <i>Folino</i> there was psychiatric evidence indicating that any period of incarceration
    might “open [Folino] up to the risk of fatal dissociation culminating in
    possible suicide.”  On appeal, the updated opinion of the same psychiatrist indicated
    that Folino was in a “very fragile mental and physical state”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But <i>Folino</i> cannot be read as restricting conditional sentences to
    those Internet luring cases where the offender would be imperilled by
    incarceration.   As noted, McMurtry C.J.O., while confirming that the paramount
    considerations in a case involving child luring over the Internet are
    denunciation and deterrence, found the trial judge erred by overemphasizing
    these factors and failing to consider the sentencing objective of
    rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In argument, the Crown repeatedly emphasized that the trial judge had
    said that this was not a rare or unusual case, and this comment meant that, applying <i>Folino</i>, a jail sentence was required.  In my view, the Crown makes too
    much of this comment.  The label that a trial judge puts on a case is not as
    important as his or her analysis and application of the relevant sentencing
    factors.  The trial judge in this case proceeded in a manner consistent with <i>Folino</i>. 
    She recognized that the paramount sentencing considerations were denunciation
    and deterrence, but imposed a conditional sentence after considering the
    respondent’s prospects for rehabilitation.  The trial judge discussed all of
    the relevant factors in detail.  She identified the correct sentencing range,
    made a positive decision to depart from it, and explained her reasons for doing
    so.  She had the respondent before her and was better positioned than this
    court to assess his prospects for rehabilitation.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has established that appellate courts must show great
    deference in reviewing decisions of trial judges where appeals against sentence
    are concerned.  In<i> R. v. L.M.,</i> [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at para. 14, the
    Supreme Court reiterated what it said in<i> R. v. M. (C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1
    S.C.R. 500, at para. 90: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[A]bsent an error in
    principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the
    appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence
    imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.</span><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here it is not suggested that the trial judge failed to consider a
    relevant factor.   The submission is that she attached inappropriate weight to
    the restorative objectives of sentencing.  I disagree.  In my view, it is
    apparent that the trial judge was applying the guidance provided by this
    court’s decision in <i>Folino</i>.  Her reasons adequately explain why she
    decided that, for this offender, a sentence outside the usual range was
    appropriate.  In this case, there is insufficient basis to interfere with her
    exercise of discretion and, to do so, would confuse rather than assist the
    trial judge’s task with applying <i>Folino</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude that there is no basis for interfering with the
    sentence by the trial judge.  I would grant leave to appeal sentence and
    dismiss the appeal.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge decided that intermittent service of the minimum
    sentence of imprisonment for the conviction of possession of child pornography
    “would be inadequate to address denunciation, general deterrence and specific
    deterrence”.  So the trial judge ordered that the respondent serve the minimum
    sentence of imprisonment on consecutive days, rather than intermittently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appears to have recognized that the same sentencing
    objectives applicable in cases of possession of child pornography, deterrence
    and denunciation, mandate the imposition of sentences of institutional
    incarceration, absent exceptional circumstances, in cases of child luring. She
    found no “unusual circumstances” in connection with the child luring offence. 
    But she ordered that the 12 month sentence she imposed for child luring be
    served in the community.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleagues would not interfere with the sentence imposed for child
    luring.  I take a different view.  I would grant leave to appeal, allow the
    appeal, set aside the sentence imposed on the conviction of child luring, and
    impose a term of actual imprisonment of equivalent length.  My reasons follow.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Circumstances of the
    Offence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleagues’ brief description of the child luring offence requires
    further elaboration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s “chats” lasted for more than four hours and are
    littered with references to his interlocutor’s age, physical development and
    sexual inexperience.  The respondent encouraged “Natasha” to recruit a
    13-year-old sexually experienced friend to join them for a “threesome” at the
    interlocutor’s home when her mother was away from the residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During his “chats” with “Natasha”, the respondent proposed having sexual
    intercourse with and performing cunnilingus on both the interlocutor and her
    13-year-old friend.  He pointed out that the intercourse might be painful for
    “Natasha”, who had described herself as a 12-year-old virgin.  He promised to
    bring condoms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was arrested as he approached the place at which he had
    agreed to meet both “girls” before heading off to “Natasha’s” unoccupied home.
    He had no condoms with him.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Circumstances of the
    Offender</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Len Kushnier provided a clinical assessment of the respondent’s risk of
    re-offending and a prognosis for his treatment.  At the initial assessment,
    based entirely on the respondent’s uncorroborated account, Mr. Kushnier
    characterized the risk of recidivism as “low to moderate”.  Apprised of the
    actual state of affairs, Mr. Kushnier expressed concern and reassessed the risk
    as “moderate”.  The sentencing judge assigned no weight to the initial
    assessment. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of Counsel at
    Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor sought a global sentence of two years less one day of
    actual imprisonment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent at trial sought a bifurcated sentencing
    hearing.  He proposed sentences of imprisonment of 45 days (child pornography)
    and 90 days (child luring) to be served intermittently, imposed and to begin on
    separate dates. Absent a bifurcated sentencing hearing, counsel for the
    respondent at trial (not Mr. Sheppard) proposed a conditional sentence of
    imprisonment on the child luring conviction.  The term counsel suggested was
    between 9 and 18 months.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some background is necessary to provide context for my dissension from the
    conclusion of my colleagues.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Offence
    of Child Luring</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 172.1(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> creates a preparatory
    crime. The conduct that the provision criminalizes not only precedes the
    commission of the sexual offences to which it refers, but also falls on the
    preparation side of the preparation/attempt divide. The legislative objective
    that underpins the provision is prophylactic in nature - to prevent the risk of
    sexual abuse of children by barring the door in advance of the predator’s entry: <i>R. v. Legare</i>,<i> </i>[2009] 3 S.C.R. 551, at para. 25.  The exploitative
    reserve of the internet is almost limitless, the anonymity it affords a magic
    elixir to reduce the inhibitions and exploit the curiosity, immaturity or
    sexual precocity of young persons.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Sentencing Principles in Child Luring</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislative objective that undergirds the offence of child luring
    equally informs the principles that predominate in sentencing the convicted
    child lurer – deterrence and denunciation: <i>R. v. Folino</i>, [2005] O.J. No.
    4737 (C.A.), at para. <span lang=FR-CA>25; <i>R. v. Jarvis</i> (2006), 211
    C.C.C. (3d) 20 (Ont. C.A.) at paras. </span>27 and 31; and <i>R. v. Alicandro </i>(2009),
    95 O.R. (3d) 173 (C.A.), at para. 49.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specific deterrence attempts to convince the person receiving sentence
    not to do it again.  General deterrence tries to induce others who may be
    tempted to commit a similar offence not to do so.  Denunciation targets a wider
    audience, the public.  The role of denunciation is to convince the public that
    child luring is a true crime, a serious offence, not something obsolete,
    technical or minor: <i>R. v. Innes </i>(2008), 231 C.C.C. (3d) 48 (Alta. C.A.),
    at para. 10.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The predominance of the sentencing objectives of deterrence and
    denunciation yields a general rule that the sentence imposed on convicted child
    lurers will be one of institutional or actual incarceration for a term of 12
    months to 2 years: <i>Folino </i>at para. 25; <i>Jarvis </i>at para. 31; <i>Alicandro </i>at para. 49.  The general rule is not without exception: the term of
    imprisonment may be served conditionally rather than institutionally.  But the
    teachings of <i>Folino</i> are that conditional sentences of imprisonment are
    only appropriate “in the rarest of cases”: <i>Folino</i> at para. 25.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision in <i>Folino </i>exemplifies what the court considered one
    of “the rarest of cases” in which a conditional sentence of imprisonment was
    appropriate. A negligible risk of recidivism.  Acceptance of responsibility. 
    Participation and progress in treatment for management of stress.  A
    devastating impact of proceedings on Folino and his family.  Assaults by other
    inmates while in custody awaiting release. And uncontradicted evidence of a
    very fragile mental and physical state due to the proceedings and of the
    detrimental effect of reincarceration on Folino<i> </i>and his three young
    children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Imposition of a conditional sentence of imprisonment rather than a term
    of institutional imprisonment on conviction of child luring must also be
    consistent with the principles that govern conditional sentences.  The
    conditional sentence must be consistent with the fundamental purpose and
    principles of sentencing described in ss. 718-718.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    Although a conditional sentence of imprisonment can provide significant
    denunciation and deterrence, some circumstances evoke a need for denunciation
    and deterrence that is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable
    way in which to express society’s condemnation of an offender’s conduct or to
    deter similar conduct in the future.  In those cases, incarceration is the
    preferable sanction: <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 61, at para. 127.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was tasked with the responsibility of imposing sentence
    on a first offender convicted on his own admission of guilt of an offence,
    child luring, that presumptively warrants a term of incarceration as the
    appropriate sentencing disposition.  The trial judge was also required to
    impose sentence on the same first offender for another admitted offence,
    possession of child pornography, that required imposition of a term of
    imprisonment as a minimum punishment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made two findings that render her imposition of a
    conditional sentence on the child luring conviction vulnerable on appellate
    review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she found that intermittent service of the mandatory minimum term
    of institutional imprisonment did not adequately service the sentencing
    objectives of deterrence and denunciation on the conviction for possession of
    child pornography.  Continuous service of the sentence was required to
    vindicate denunciation and deterrence, thus to satisfy the fundamental
    principle of proportionality and s. 718.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge did not consider that the circumstances of the
    child luring offence fell within the descriptive, “the rarest of cases”, used in <i>Folino</i>.  Like my colleagues, I take this to be a reference, albeit
    unstated, to the exception made in <i>Folino</i> to the presumptive
    institutional incarceration as the appropriate sentencing disposition in child
    luring cases. My colleagues consider prosecutorial reliance on this phrase as
    demonstrative of an error in principle as a substitution of form for substance,
    packaging for product, label for content.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing took this case out of the general rule that incarceration
    follows conviction of child luring. Nothing in the circumstances of the
    offence. And nothing in the circumstances of the offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The child luring conviction did not stand alone. The respondent was also
    convicted of possession of child pornography, a circumstance that is an aggravating
    factor in determining a sentence for child luring: <i>Jarvis</i> at para. 31. 
    The respondent proposed sexual conduct with two “underage” girls, one of whom
    he enticed to bring along a friend for a “threesome”.  The conduct proposed by
    the respondent, if committed in relation to real interlocutors of equivalent
    age, would have attracted minimum terms of imprisonment and been beyond the
    reach of conditional sentences.  And the respondent gave every indication that
    he was proceeding according to plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was a youthful first offender who admitted his guilt on
    the day his preliminary inquiry was scheduled to begin. He went to school,
    worked part-time, married and had a young child. His acceptance of
    responsibility and attendance at counselling proceeded at a leisurely pace.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s findings did not remove this case from the presumptive
    rule of institutional incarceration.  In my view, the imposition of a
    conditional sentence reflects an error in principle, a misapplication of the
    decision of this court in <i>Folino</i>, an under emphasis on the sentencing
    objectives of denunciation and deterrence, and an overemphasis on
    rehabilitation.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set
    aside the conditional sentence and impose a sentence of imprisonment for 12
    months.</p>
