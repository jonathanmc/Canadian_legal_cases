style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of attempting to obstruct the course of
    justice and breach of recognizance on a particularized indictment alleging that
    he did:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of June 2005,
    at the Town of Newmarket … wilfully did attempt to obstruct the course of
    justice in a judicial proceeding by dissuading Glenn Page, a witness in a
    criminal proceeding from  giving evidence by a threat or other corrupt means,
    contrary to section 139(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>and further that he did</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of June 2005,
    at the Town of Newmarket … being at large on a recognizance entered into before
    a justice and being bound to comply with a condition of that recognizance
    directed by the said justice failed without lawful excuse to comply with that
    condition, to wit: keep the peace and be of good behaviour, contrary to section
    145(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction and submits that the trial judge
    erred in law by misapplying the test for the “corrupt means” element of the
    offence and misapprehended pieces of evidence and in so doing arrived at an
    unreasonable verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Originally the indictment on the obstruct justice charge did not include
    the words “by a threat or other corrupt means”.  At the outset of trial counsel
    for the appellant brought a motion requesting that the indictment be amended to
    provide particulars pursuant to section 587(1)(f) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> –
    to particularize the means by which the appellant was alleged to have
    obstructed the course of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following Glen Page’s evidence-in-chief, the trial judge ordered that the
    indictment be particularized to include the words “by threat or other corrupt
    means”.  The motion was, at the time, unopposed by Crown counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the second day of trial Crown counsel moved pursuant to s. 601 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requesting that the indictment be amended to return it to
    its original language that is, without the words “by threat or other corrupt
    means”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge denied the Crown’s motion in written reasons which
    stated in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The amendment seeks to change the basis of the
    Crown’s case near the conclusion of the cross-examination of its sole witness.
    Thus, if the amendment is granted, the accused and his counsel were misled as
    to what was alleged by the Crown after the sole witness has been cross-examined
    on the particularized count.  It is prejudicial to delete the particulars
    because it changes the case the accused must meet at this late stage of the
    cross-examination.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005 the appellant and one Sean Donovan co-owned a business that
    provided civil engineering services. The complainant, Glenn Page was an
    employee of that business.  In the course of that business relationship two
    events occurred which form the backdrop to this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, on one occasion Page borrowed a truck from the business for his
    personal use during which time it was damaged and required repairs. The truck’s
    warranty had expired and so to avoid having to pay for repairs himself, he
    (Page) provided the serial number from a different truck also owned by the
    business to the repair shop.  In so doing he fraudulently claimed the repairs
    under warranty from a different vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, some construction equipment disappeared from a worksite run by
    the company. The appellant and his business partner Sean Donovan were both
    charged criminally in relation to the disappearance.  Page was subpoenaed as a
    witness to the preliminary inquiry in relation to those charges, scheduled to
    begin June 10, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 3, 2005 the appellant telephoned Mr. Page.  Factual details of
    the conversation were disputed at trial.  Mr. Page testified that the appellant
    called him and they had a friendly conversation. The appellant gave him (Page)
    a “heads up” that Sean Donovan’s lawyer (the appellant and his business partner
    Sean Donovan were jointly charged) was planning to cross-examine him (Page) at
    the preliminary inquiry on the past incident involving the fraudulent repair of
    a company truck. Page testified that he did not want to come to court to be
    asked questions about that fraudulent transaction.  Page said the appellant told
    him not to show up for court.  Page said the appellant told him that his
    evidence was like a chapter in a book and it would slow down the proceedings
    and possibly lead to a mistrial if Page didn’t attend because it would take too
    long to complete the case.  When Page said he had to attend because he had been
    subpoenaed, the appellant said he would need a good reason not to attend such
    as a note from a doctor saying he was injured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified and did not deny he called Page or that he told him
    about the planned cross-examination strategy of his co-accused, Sean Donovan.
    He also agreed he’d told Page that he would need a doctor’s note to miss
    court.  The appellant denied telling Page not to attend court and further
    denied telling Page that by not attending it would delay the case and may cause
    a mistrial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence and found that the
    appellant wilfully attempted to dissuade Page from giving evidence in a
    criminal proceeding by corrupt means during the course of a telephone
    conversation on June 3, 2005.  The trial judge identified the corrupt means as
    the appellant’s suggestion that Page obtain a false doctor’s note stipulating
    that he was injured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He convicted the appellant of attempting to obstruct justice and
    conviction on the breach of recognizance charge flowed from that.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offence of obstructing justice is proscribed in s. 139 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            139(1)               Every one who
    wilfully attempts in any manner to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of
    justice in a judicial proceeding,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       by indemnifying or agreeing to
    indemnify a surety, in any way and either in whole or in part, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       where he is a surety, by accepting or
    agreeing to accept a fee or any form of indemnity whether in whole or in part
    from or in respect of a person who is released or is to be released from
    custody, is guilty of</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)       an indictable offence and is liable
    to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d)       an offence punishable on summary
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            139(2)   Every one who wilfully
    attempts in any manner other than a manner described in subsection (1) to
    obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty of an indictable
    offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            139(3)            Without restricting
    the generality of subsection (2), everyone shall be deemed wilfully to attempt
    to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice who in a judicial
    proceeding, existing or proposed,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       dissuades or attempts to dissuade a
    person by threats, bribes or other corrupt means from giving evidence;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       influences or attempts to influence
    by threats, bribes or other corrupt means a person in his conduct as a juror,
    or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)       accepts or obtains, agrees to accept
    or attempts to obtain a bribe or other corrupt consideration to abstain from
    giving evidence, or to do or to refrain from doing anything as a juror.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s critical findings are set out in paragraphs 23, 24 and
    25 of the appellant’s factum as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>23.       The trial judge then made a series of
    findings of fact, including:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       Mr. Reynolds telephoned Mr. Page on
    June 3, 2005.  The conversation commenced in a normal manner but Mr. Reynolds
    directed the conversation to the upcoming preliminary hearing concerning a
    charge of fraud against him and Mr. Donovan relating to the disappearance of
    the Badger equipment.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)     Mr. Reynolds was not represented by a
    lawyer. Mr. Reynolds told Mr. Page during this telephone conversation that Mr.
    Donovan’s lawyer intended to cross-examine him concerning the fraudulent
    warranty repair of the Badger truck and might suggest that Mr. Page may have
    been involved in the disappearance of the equipment.  Mr. Page would be
    concerned for himself and his friend if the warranty fraud were revealed.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iv)      Mr. Reynolds suggested to Mr. Page
    that he should not attend court (“not show up”) for the upcoming preliminary
    hearing.  The purpose was to delay and lengthen the proceedings, which might
    cause a “mistrial”.  Mr. Reynolds previously provided Mr. Page with an
    incentive not to attend court when he suggested that he had exposure for the
    warranty fraud.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(v)       When Mr. Page asked Mr. Reynolds how
    he might avoid attending the preliminary hearing in accordance with his
    subpoena, Mr. Reynolds suggested to Mr. Page that he could obtain a note from
    his doctor saying he was unable to attend.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24.       Later in the Reasons for Judgment, the
    trial judge stated that he “finds beyond a reasonable doubt” the following:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        Mr. Reynolds told Mr. Page not to
    attend the preliminary hearing of June 10, 2005 in order to delay the
    proceeding Mr. Reynolds’s conduct had a tendency to obstruct the course of
    justice.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       the corrupt means was the suggestion
    to Mr. Page that he obtain a false doctor’s note for not attending court.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)     Mr. Reynolds intended to obstruct the
    course of justice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>25.       The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            I find beyond a reasonable doubt that
    Mr. Reynolds wilfully attempted to dissuade Glen Page from giving evidence in a
    judicial proceeding by corrupt means during the course of a telephone
    conversation with Mr. Page on June 3, 2005.  <i>The corrupt means was the
    suggestion to the witness that he should obtain a doctor’s note stipulating
    that he was injured.  </i>I find Mr. Reynolds guilty of count 1 in the
    indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the Crown is required to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt the allegations set out in the indictment. Where the
    indictment has been particularized, as here, to specify the wrongful act relied
    on, the Crown must prove the facts as set out therein.  Here the indictment was
    particularized to specify the wrongful act as “dissuading Glen Page, a witness
    in a criminal proceeding from giving evidence … by a threat or other corrupt
    means”. This language mirrors that set out in s. 139(3)(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  Hence the Crown had to prove:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">(a)       the
        appellant dissuaded Glen Page from giving evidence, and</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">(b)       that
        he did so by a threat or other corrupt means.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded beyond a reasonable doubt<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> that the appellant told Page not to attend the preliminary hearing of June 10,
    2005, in order to delay the proceeding and that his conduct had the tendency to
    obstruct the course of justice.  That finding is not seriously challenged in
    this court. Had the indictment not been amended and particularized as it was,
    this finding would have been sufficient to support a conviction under section
    139(2).  However, the particularized indictment required that the Crown prove
    not only that Page was dissuaded from giving evidence but that he was dissuaded
    by a threat or other corrupt means.  In this regard the trial judge concluded
    that the corrupt means was the suggestion to Page that he obtain a false
    doctor’s note for not attending court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant first argues that the trial judge’s finding in relation to
    the “false” doctor’s note does not in law amount to a “corrupt means” within
    the meaning of the<i> Criminal Code</i>.  The <span lang=EN-US>“means” must be
    the methodology used to dissuade the witness from giving evidence i.e.) a
    threat or other corrupt means.  On these facts that could only be the
    information that Page would be cross-examined in relation to a prior fraudulent
    act he had committed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further argues that the record does not support the
    finding of a “false” doctor’s note and that in coming to this conclusion the
    trial judge misapprehended the evidence.  The appellant says there was no
    argument by the Crown that there had been the suggestion that Page obtain a
    false doctor’s note.  Page’s evidence on this point at trial was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. KANDOLA:      Q. You made reference earlier
    that in your conversation he suggested that you see a doctor and get a note or
    something;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That’s correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Which conversation did that …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Out of the two that was in the first one.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And how did that come about?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Just because I had a subpoena I would
    need to not show up, you would have to have a legitimate reason because the
    court was asking you to be there and the only way to do that would be to have
    some sort of acknowledgement from a doctor that you were not able to appear.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Did you respond to that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Not – I don’t know how to describe I
    responded.  I just – just carried on from there, and he just said, “that would
    be the way you would have to do it,” ‘cause I had said like how could I – “why
    would I do that,” or, “How could I not appear, I have a subpoena,” and he led
    into that you’d need a – a good reason, a note from a doctor saying you’re
    injured somehow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>and when cross-examined in relation to the doctor’s note
    Page’s evidence was:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Right, ‘cause you were under oath, OK? 
    So that’s why I’m suggesting to you that one of the things Mr. Reynolds said to
    you is, “If you decide not to come you have to have a good reason ‘cause you’re
    under subpoena, you can’t just not show up”, right, that’s how the conversation
    went.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Um, part of it, yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        You said, “How could I do that, how could
    I not come to court when I’m subpoenaed”, and Mr. Reynolds response is, “Well,
    if you’re not going to show up you better have a good reason”, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yeah, I wasn’t asking for a method how, I
    was just referring to like, “How could I do that, I’ve been subpoenaed?”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        How could one do that generally, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yeah, I have to go.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        About the court process, like how does
    that work, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Not how does it work, just how could
    someone not do that, not – I wasn’t asking for a way, I was just saying
    basically I was saying, “I have to go, like I’ve been subpoenaed, I have to go.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        But you did ask that question, “How could
    someone do that?  How could I do that, how could I not show up?”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        How could I not show up was a …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And his response is, “If you don’t show
    up, you better have a good reason”, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And one of the things he said after that
    was, “Like for example, if you were sick you’d need a doctor’s note”, do you
    agree with that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The argument simply put is that the evidence does not amount to a
    suggestion by the appellant to Page to get a false doctor’s note.  The
    discussion was that when a person is under subpoena he or she would need a legitimate
    reason for not showing up in response to a subpoena and by way of example the
    appellant was suggesting if the witness was ill he would require a doctor’s
    note. The Crown did not advance the theory that the suggestion from the
    appellant to Page was that he obtain a false doctor’s note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his submissions to the trial judge in relation to the doctor’s note
    Crown counsel said in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The clearest example of the corrupt means is
    suggesting a doctor’s note.  I would go further and say that the – the – the
    content and the context of the discussion was corrupt but a – a material
    example clear in the evidence, corroborated by both sides, is the area of the
    doctor’s note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obvious question arises whether in any event, even a false doctor’s
    note can, in law, amount to a “means” of dissuading a witness from giving
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 139(3)(a) reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            139(3)  Without restricting the
    generality of subsection (2), every one shall be deemed wilfully to attempt to
    obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice who in a judicial proceeding,
    existing or proposed,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       dissuades or attempts to dissuade a
    person by threats, bribes or other corrupt means from giving evidence …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t the doctor’s note that would cause Page to be concerned, if
    anything, it was the likelihood of being cross-examined by Donovan’s counsel
    about the warranty fraud he had been earlier involved in.  Yet that was not the
    theory advanced by the Crown nor the subject of a finding by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “means” needs to be the reason the person is not testifying; the
    means of persuasion used to dissuade the witness from testifying. On this
    indictment, the Crown is required to prove the means of persuasion was a threat
    or other corrupt means.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that it was required to prove that the appellant
    attempted to dissuade Page from giving evidence by a threat or other corrupt
    means<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issue then is whether the appellant’s suggestion of a false
    doctor’s note satisfied the “corrupt means” element of the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge’s
    finding that the appellant suggested that Page obtain a false doctor’s
    certificate.  During Page’s evidence-in-chief the following exchange took
    place:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:   All right, who – wait a minute.  Suggested
    that you not attend court, and who was confused, or he suggested you were
    confused?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, I – I was confused as to why he was asking me that or – you know,
    how someone would do that. He suggested that I get – see a doctor and get a
    note saying I was sick or something.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view this evidence together with Page’s other evidence of what the
    appellant had said to him and specifically that he not show up in response to
    the subpoena that had been served on him support the reasonable inference that
    what was being suggested was that Page obtain a false doctor’s certificate –
    one that would say he was sick when he in fact was not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The more difficult question is whether such could constitute “other
    corrupt means” of dissuading Page from giving evidence. There was no suggestion
    from Page that the appellant’s phone calls were anything other than a “friendly
    heads-up”.  He agreed the appellant’s tone throughout was friendly and there
    was never anything threatening about it.  The appellant told him not to show up
    because Donovan’s lawyer was going to cross-examine him about the earlier
    warranty fraud which may get him (Page) and his friend Brent who was also
    involved, in trouble.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view it was not the false doctor’s note that would cause Page not
    to show up rather it  was  the  apprehension,  fear  or  concern  that  his  involvement
     in  the  earlier </p>
  <br
clear=all>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>warranty fraud would be brought to light.  It may result
    in him (Page) being charged criminally in relation to it or at the least
    embarrass him and put him in a bad light in front of the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charge required that the Crown prove that the appellant attempted to
    dissuade Page from giving evidence by threat or other corrupt means.  As this
    court said in <i>R. v. S.S.</i>, [2002] O.J.<i> </i>No. 678 at paragraph 4:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The offence of attempt to obstruct justice can be
    committed in many ways.  Here, the Crown alleged that the obstruction lay in
    the causing of the witnesses to make false statements.  As pled, the charge
    required that the Crown prove both that the statements were false and that the
    appellant knew they were false. We cannot agree that this allegation is
    surplusage. It describes the means by which the offence was committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those words are apt to this case.  As pled, the Crown was required to
    prove that the appellant attempted to dissuade Page from giving evidence by
    threat or other corrupt means.  I agree with observations of the trial judge in
    his December 14, 2007 ruling on the Crown’s motion to further amend the
    indictment by deleting the particulars ordered by the court in relation to the
    obstruction of justice count in the indictment on the earlier motion of the
    defence where he noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The particularized count contained essential
    averments of nature of the offence, the date of the offence, the identity of
    the witness and the manner in which the Crown alleged the accused committed the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence. The particularized count was not surplusage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in <i>R. v. A.D. </i>(2007), 222 C.C.C.
    (3d) 217, considered the surplusage rule in relation to a charge under section
    139 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The facts of that case are not dissimilar.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November, 2002 the appellant, A.D., was told by her then
    five-year-old granddaughter that she had been sexually assaulted by her father,
    the appellant’s son. According to the testimony of the granddaughter and her
    brother, who was present when the granddaughter made the disclosure, the
    appellant told them “don’t tell anyone or Dad will go to jail”.  Later when the
    children’s mother, who was estranged from the children’s father, called to
    speak to the children, her daughter was crying and the mother could not
    understand her.  When she spoke to her son, and asked what was going on he told
    his mother that he’d been directed by A.D., the appellant not to tell.  Later
    when the children returned home the mother learned of the allegation, contacted
    police and the father was charged and eventually pled guilty on April 30,
    2004.  The appellant, AD, had been interviewed by police November 10, 2002, but
    was not charged until February 21, 2004 with the offence of attempting to
    obstruct justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The indictment against the accused read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THAT SHE, the said A.D., on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> Day of November, 2002 at or near Oakpoint, in the Province of Manitoba, did
    unlawfully and wilfully attempt to dissuade [J.D.], and [B.D.] by threats from
    giving evidence in a judicial proceedings to wit: the <i>Queen versus [W.D.]</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.D. argued that the indictment was flawed:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">1.         as
        of November 2, 2002 no judicial proceeding had been initiated against her son,
        and</p>
      <p class="headingNUMBER">2.         the
        indictment did not specify the manner in which the obstruction of justice was
        said to have occurred.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant A.D. further argued that the trial judge erred when she
    indicated that the specifics contained in the indictment which was based on s.
    139(3) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>were mere surplusage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In ruling against the accused the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… I have ruled that the lack of evidence as to the
    giving of evidence in a judicial proceeding and any attempt to obstruct justice
    in that respect, would arise under subsection (3) of section 139 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> which allows the Crown to rely on that in proof, the court then,
    deeming proof of the offence.  I want to make it clear that I am not satisfied
    that that kind of evidence, in terms of by threat, attempting to dissuade the
    children from giving evidence in a judicial proceeding against their father has
    been established. The Crown has not sought to have me draw any deeming
    conclusion, based on that lack of evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So what I am left with is determining under s.
    139(2) whether the Crown has established all of the essential elements of the
    offence beyond a reasonable doubt …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its reasons the Court of Appeal noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge accepted the Crown’s argument that
    the wording in the indictment that paralleled s. 139(3) was mere surplusage,
    and did not constitute an essential element of the offence that had to be
    proved.  The judge noted that s. 139(3) operated to deem certain types of
    conduct as falling within the broader language of s. 139(3); however, she found
    that “the substantive offence” was contained in s. 139(2).  She further found
    that “[t]he language of the indictment contains the general provision of
    section 139(2) in this case, as well as some of the wording of section 139(3).”
    The judge concluded that the appellant would not be prejudiced by the
    application of the surplusage rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court then went on to review the surplusage rule and concluded in
    paragraph 26 and following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on this review of the surplusage rule, I am of
    the view that the judge erred in relying upon it in the circumstances of this
    case. What should have transpired, based on the evidence, is that the Crown
    should have formally sought, and in my view, would have been granted an
    amendment to the indictment to reflect the true state of affairs. The accused
    was not being caught by surprise but the indictment, as framed, did not fully
    reflect the evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            In summary, therefore, it is clear from
    the trial judge’s finding that the evidence in this case did not correspond
    with the wording of the charge in the indictment.  While it may possibly be
    argued that the current wording of the indictment was sufficient to charge the
    appellant under s. 139(2), it would have been preferable if the indictment had
    been amended. In fact, the trial judge implicitly severed or amended the
    indictment to reflect the broader wording of s.&nbsp;139(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the conclusions of the trial judge differ in this case, the
    principles expressed in A.D. are nevertheless apt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons earlier expressed I am of the view that the trial judge
    erred when he concluded that the corrupt means was the suggestion to Page that
    he obtain a false doctor’s note.  His conclusion, however, that the appellant
    told Page not to attend the preliminary hearing on June 10, 2005 in order to
    delay the proceedings and that his conduct had a tendency to obstruct the
    course of justice was fully justified on the record before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown requests that if this court were to conclude that the “corrupt
    means” element was not established, that the court amend the indictment
    pursuant to its power in s. 683(1)(g) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and remove
    the particulars “by threat or other corrupt means” that  were added by the
    trial judge.  And further as set out in paragraph 20 of her factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Though appellate courts
    take a cautious approach to exercising the amending power, in the unique
    circumstances of this case, there is no prejudice to the appellant as the
    Crown’s theory of liability remains unchanged.  The appellant attempted to
    obstruct justice by contacting a witness under subpoena and telling him not to
    attend court. The appellant told Mr. Page that he would (<i>sic</i>)
    cross-examined about a previous fraudulent incident and would be identified as
    a possible perpetrator of the crime that was the subject of the proceedings. 
    The appellant said that Mr. Page might “get into trouble” as a result.  The
    appellant also suggested Mr. Page obtain a false doctor’s note to escape any
    consequence for failing to attend court as required.  In these circumstances,
    the essential elements of the offence of obstruct justice are satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant resists the Crown’s request to amend the indictment and
    argues that the request constitutes a collateral attack on the trial judge’s
    ruling wherein he refused the Crown’s motion to amend the indictment by
    deleting the particulars after the second day of evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the Crown seeks in this court the same relief that was refused by
    the trial judge, the request cannot be considered a “collateral” attack of that
    ruling – if anything it is a direct attack.  There is no procedure under the <i>Criminal
    Rules</i> for a cross-appeal as there is in the civil rules.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s first position is that the trial judgment be affirmed in all
    respects.  If, however, this court is of the view that the “corrupt means”
    aspect has not been made out, then in that event seeks an amendment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Irwin </i>(1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 316, this court held that
    s. 683(1)(g) permitted an amendment on appeal where the amendment cured differences
    between the charge laid and the evidence led at trial.  This power however,
    could only be exercised if an accused was not misled or prejudiced in his
    defence or appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>A.D.</i>, the court cited this court’s decision in <i>Irwin </i>and
    stated at paragraph 31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus it would appear that whether or not an
    amendment should be ordered by this court is governed primarily by the
    prejudice that might flow to an accused if such an amendment were made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The prejudice alleged in this case is that, based
    on the wording of the charge, cross-examination was focused in a particular
    fashion.  As well, the accused notes in her factum that “certain aspects of the
    evidence of the child witnesses became significantly less important to
    challenge or offset when the charge or charges are worded in a certain fashion
    as in the instant case”.  The accused argues this prejudice could only be
    overcome by ordering a new trial on a charge laid under s. 139(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The argument made against amendment and the alleged prejudice to the
    accused in <i>A.D. </i>are not unlike the arguments made in this case.  Here
    the appellant argues that his cross-examination of the witnesses was geared to
    defeat the particulars.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>A.D. </i> the Crown argued, in response to the appellant’s
    argument in relation to prejudice:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown argues that the accused was not
    prejudiced, as section 139(3) is merely a deeming provision, it did not afford
    the accused a complete defence to the charge of obstructing justice. The
    accused would still have been liable to conviction for obstruction of justice
    under s. 139(2), even if the deeming provision (s. 139(3)) was not engaged.  As
    such the Crown submits that the accused has not actually suffered any
    prejudice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            As previously noted, the trial judge
    clearly found that s. 139(3) was inapplicable, but did not formally amend the
    charge in the indictment to reflect this finding.  Instead, she found that the
    wording of the charge that paralleled s. 139(3) was merely surplusage, and that
    the indictment was sufficient to ground the appellant’s conviction under s.
    139(2).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view the accused was well aware of the
    transaction or events giving rise to the charge, she was not “caught by
    surprise”. The low threshold set by s. 581(2)(c) must be borne in mind. 
    (citation omitted)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given that s. 139(3) is extricably limited to and
    is only a subset of s. 139(2), the result of a new trial would invariably be
    the same as the trial already held.  As such I believe this is an appropriate
    case to formalize the amendment implicit in the trial judge’s findings, which I
    now do, and thus, I dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The only difference between this case and <i>A.D.</i> is that the
    amendment sought in this court was specifically sought and refused in the court
    below. The only question that remains is whether in such circumstances this
    court should refuse to amend the indictment and acquit the accused or order a
    new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the completion of the evidence the Crown moved before the trial judge
    to further amend the indictment by deleting the particulars earlier added on
    the appellant’s motion which, at the time, the Crown did not oppose.  The trial
    judge dismissed the Crown’s motion and in his reasons noted that the
    particulars were not mere surplusage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s defence was directed at defeating the particulars alleged
    against him.  His cross-examination of witnesses was directed at the

    liability against him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view it would be prejudicial to the appellant to amend the
    indictment in the manner sought by the Crown at this late stage.  It would in
    effect give the Crown the ability to change its theory of the case at the
    appellate level to accord with the evidence when the theory on which it
    prosecuted the case was not made out at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, this court is left with little alternative but to

    offence.  In my opinion, he did not.  The Crown succeeded in proving the charge
    of obstruct justice, as particularized in the Indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Indictment alleged that the appellant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of June 2005, at the Town of Newmarket … wilfully did attempt to obstruct
    the course of justice in a judicial proceeding <i>by dissuading</i> Glenn Page, <i>a witness </i>in a criminal proceeding <i>from giving evidence by a threat
    or other corrupt means</i>, contrary to section 139(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> are the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>139(2)              Every one who
    wilfully attempts in any manner other than a manner described in subsection (1)<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty of an indictable
    offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>139(3)            
    Without restricting the generality of subsection (2), everyone shall be deemed
    wilfully to attempt to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice who in
    a judicial proceeding, existing or proposed,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)     Dissuades or
    attempts to dissuade a person by threats, bribes or other corrupt means from
    giving evidence; …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   I accept
    that, having particularized the offence to charge dissuasion “by a threat or
    other corrupt means”, the Crown must prove the elements of the Indictment as
    particularized, namely that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appellant dissuaded Glenn Page from giving evidence; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>he did so
    by a threat or other corrupt means.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with my colleague that the trial judge was entitled to find
    on the evidence, as he did, that the first of these elements was made out: the
    appellant told Mr. Page not to attend the appellant’s preliminary hearing in
    order to delay that proceeding; this conduct had the tendency to obstruct
    justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where I part ways with my colleague is with her conclusion that by
    suggesting Mr. Page accomplish this objective by deceiving the court through the
    presentation of a false doctor’s certificate, the appellant was not
    “dissuading” Mr. Page “from giving evidence by a threat or other corrupt
    means.”   In my respectful view, he was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his skilful argument on behalf of the appellant, Mr. DiLuca drew a distinction
    – which my colleague accepts – between <i>the method of persuasion</i> (which
    is what must constitute the “corrupt means”) and <i>the means of implementing</i> Mr. Page’s desire not to testify.  On this view of the elements of the <i>actus
    reus</i> of the offence as charged, the appellant’s method of persuasion was
    providing the incentive not to testify.  This was accomplished by holding out
    the potential that Mr. Page would be embarrassed (or worse) when cross-examined
    by counsel for the appellant about his fraudulent truck repair claim.  The
    false doctor’s note, says Mr. DiLuca, was simply “a logistical detail” offered
    as a means of implementing the failure to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not see it that way.  The distinction between the method of
    persuasion and the suggested means of carrying out the desired goal, which is
    the object of the persuasion, is too subtle for me to accept in this context. 
    The <i>actus reus</i> of the offence cannot be so finely parsed if the “corrupt
    means” language in subsection 139(3)(a) is to be given any meaningful effect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Briefly put, the appellant’s act of dissuasion consisted of saying this
    to Mr. Page: “You are going to be exposed to potential embarrassment, if not
    criminal liability, if you testify at my preliminary hearing, and you can get
    out of this dilemma, and avoid your subpoena, by presenting a false doctor’s
    certificate to the court.”  This is an improper, dishonest, method of
    dissuasion – akin to a bribe or threat – and one that is inherently corrupt
    because it involves deceiving the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the particularized Indictment, and the provisions of
    subsection 139(3)(a), the method of persuasion – or, more accurately,
    dissuasion – must be viewed as a whole.  Suggesting a facile, albeit deceitful,
    way of accomplishing the desired objective is just as much a part of the
    “persuasion package” as providing the incentive to carry out the desired
    objective in the first place.  Both form part of the same chain of events
    designed to convince Mr. Page not to testify and thus effect the sought-after
    result.  The suggestion of providing a false doctor’s note was not simply a
    logistical detail; it was an integral part of the overall persuasive package.
    Its purpose was to delay and obstruct the course of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To corrupt is “to induce to act dishonestly”: <i>The Shorter Oxford
    Dictionary on Historical Principles</i>, Third Edition, Clarendon Press,
    Oxford.  That is precisely the means the appellant was employing to dissuade
    Mr. Page not to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was therefore on sound ground, in my view, when he
    concluded that the appellant’s suggestion to Mr. Page that he avoid attending
    the preliminary hearing by deceiving the court through a false doctor’s
    certificate constituted dissuasion by “corrupt means” as contemplated in
    subsection 139(3)(a) of the <i>Code</i>, and convicted the appellant.  The
    Crown had proved the charge of obstruct justice as particularized in the
    Indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
