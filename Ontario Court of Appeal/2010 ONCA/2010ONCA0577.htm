  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apaid Noel was shot and seriously wounded outside an Ottawa nightclub on
    February 19, 1998.  He died a month later on March 18, 1998.  The appellants
    were arrested within about two weeks of the shooting.  In June 2000, after a
    lengthy trial, both were convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to
    life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 18 years.  Almost five
    years later, in April 2005, this court ordered a new trial:  <i>R. v. Sarrazin</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 485 (C.A.).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The re-trial proceeded in the late summer of 2006.  In November 2006,
    after a second lengthy trial, the appellants were once again convicted of
    second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for
    parole for 18 years.  These appeals proceeded on March 31, 2010, almost three
    and a half years after the convictions on the re-trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants have been in custody for over 12 years since their arrests
    in late February and early March 1998.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the first trial, the appellants, who did not testify, argued that the
    Crown had failed to establish that they were the persons who had participated
    in the shooting of Mr. Noel.  The jury rejected that contention.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first appeal, the appellants raised several grounds of appeal. 
    This court allowed their appeals primarily on the basis that the trial judge had
    failed to properly apply <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144 in holding
    that certain statements made by Mr. Noel were admissible under the principled
    exception to the hearsay rule.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the second trial, the appellants again argued that the Crown had
    failed to prove that they were the individuals who had participated in Mr.
    Noels shooting.  In addition, the defence, through cross-examination of one of
    the Crowns medical experts, elicited evidence that Mr. Noels death may not
    have been caused by the shooting, but instead caused by the consumption of
    cocaine shortly before his death.  Causation was not an issue at the first
    trial.  Finally, the appellants argued that even if the jury found against them
    on the questions of identity and causation, the appellants should only be convicted
    of manslaughter on the basis that the gun discharged accidentally in the course
    of a struggle.  The jury rejected all of the defence contentions and once again
    convicted the appellants of second degree murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise two issues on their conviction appeals.  First,
    they submit that while evidence that the appellants and Mr. Noel were members
    of rival street gangs was admissible, the trial judge erred in admitting
    extensive evidence about the manner in which those gangs operated, their
    criminal activities, and the culture of violence that permeated both gangs.  The
    appellants also argue that the trial judges limiting instructions with respect
    to the gang evidence were inadequate.  Second, the appellants submit that the
    trial judge failed to instruct the jury that it could convict the appellants of
    attempted murder if it had a reasonable doubt as to the cause of Mr. Noels
    death.  The appellants submit that the trial judges instruction to the jury that
    it must acquit if it had a reasonable doubt on the issue of causation was wrong
    in law and was prejudicial to the appellants. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the conviction appeals, the appellants appeal the parole
    ineligibility period of 18 years.  They accept that an increase in the parole ineligibility
    period from the statutory ten year minimum was warranted, but submit that an
    ineligibility period of 18 years is manifestly excessive.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court did not call on the Crown to address the trial judges rulings
    and instructions with respect to the gang evidence<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> or the fitness of the sentences imposed.   On the one remaining ground of
    appeal, the court is unanimously of the view that the trial judge erred in law
    in failing to leave a conviction for attempted murder as a possible verdict.  My
    colleague, Moldaver J.A., is satisfied that the error resulted in no
    substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and would dismiss the appeal.  In
    my view, the curative proviso cannot overcome the legal error and there must be
    a new trial. </p>
  <h2> II.       THE EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Noel was gunned down at point blank range with a sawed-off shotgun
    while standing outside of a nightclub on a public street in Ottawa.  He was
    shot twice, once in the arm and once in the abdomen.  Mr. Noel was rushed to
    the hospital and underwent surgery.  The gunshot wound to his abdomen caused serious
    life-threatening injuries, particularly to his liver.  Skilful surgical
    intervention and medical care saved Mr. Noels life, at least for a short time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Mr. Noels post-operative progress was somewhat uneven, by
    March 13, 1998, he was doing well enough to be released from the hospital.  Dr.
    Freeman, his surgeon, expected that Mr. Noel would make a full recovery.  Mr.
    Noel died five days later as a result of a pulmonary thromboembolism, that is,
    a blood clot.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moldaver J.A. has thoroughly reviewed the evidence relating to the cause
    of Mr. Noels fatal embolism.  I cannot improve on that summary.  It is
    sufficient for present purposes to indicate that the weight of the evidence strongly
    favoured the opinion that the fatal embolism was a product of the injuries
    caused by the gunshot wound to the abdomen and the subsequent surgeries
    necessitated by that wound.  There was, however, forensic evidence that Mr.
    Noel had consumed cocaine shortly before his death, and expert evidence that it
    was possible that his consumption of cocaine, and not the gunshot wound and
    subsequent surgeries, had precipitated the fatal embolism.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence relating to the events that culminated in Mr. Noels death
    came primarily from his brother, who was with him that evening.  In his
    testimony, Mr. Noel's brother described a verbal confrontation outside of the
    nightclub involving Mr. Noel on one side, and the appellants and others on the
    other side.  Mr. Noels brother testified that the appellants said, Youre
    going to die tonight and then left the area outside of the nightclub.  They
    returned about five minutes later.  Unbeknownst to Mr. Noels brother, and
    presumably to Mr. Noel, the appellant, Mr. Sarrazin, had armed himself with a
    loaded sawed-off shotgun.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon their return to the nightclub, the appellants renewed their verbal
    threats against Mr. Noel.  Mr. Jean taunted Mr. Noel and attempted to distract
    him.  Mr. Sarrazin stepped between Mr. Jean and Mr. Noel, and pointed the
    shotgun at Mr. Noel.  When Mr. Noel reached out for the gun, Mr. Sarrazin
    fired, hitting Mr. Noel in the arm.  Mr. Noel fell to the ground.  Mr. Noels brother
    testified that as Mr. Noel lay on the ground, Mr. Jean and another person yelled
    at Mr. Sarrazin to kill Mr. Noel.  Mr. Sarrazin pointed the shotgun at Mr. Noel
    and discharged the second barrel, striking Mr. Noel in the abdomen.  A struggle
    ensued between Mr. Noels brother and the appellants.  The appellants fled the
    scene and Mr. Noels brother was left with the sawed-off shotgun.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence vigorously challenged the credibility of Mr. Noel's brother
    and the reliability of his evidence.  The defence claimed that Mr. Noel and his
    brother had brought the shotgun to the nightclub and precipitated the
    altercation during which Mr. Noel was shot.  Neither appellant testified.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the eyewitness evidence of Mr. Noels brother, there was
    testimony from other witnesses placing the appellants at the scene.  The Crown
    also relied on what was referred to as gang evidence to establish that the
    appellants had a motive to kill Mr. Noel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants were members of one Montréal Haitian street gang, and Mr.
    Noel was a member of a rival Montréal Haitian street gang.  There was a history
    of bad blood between these two gangs.  The Crown led evidence as to the manner
    in which these gangs operated, including their strong propensity for acts of
    violence against each other.  That violence often occurred in public places. 
    The Crown adduced evidence that the appellants and Mr. Noel were heavily
    involved in gang activity, which included the use of firearms and other violent
    acts, and that Mr. Sarrazin was involved in the drug trade.  The Crown was also
    allowed to lead evidence of one expert (the evidence of a second expert was excluded)
    outlining the manner in which the gangs operated and the significance of
    tattoos and other gang-related symbols.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The gang evidence was obviously potentially prejudicial to the
    appellants right to a fair trial.  The evidence was also central to the jurys
    understanding and assessment of the allegations advanced by the Crown.  The
    trial judge was obliged to address both aspects of the evidence.  He was alive
    to the potential prejudice and excluded some of the evidence tendered by the
    Crown either because it could not be properly challenged on cross-examination
    or because it was not necessary to a proper understanding of the Crowns
    allegation with respect to the motive for the murder.  As indicated above, I
    see no error in the trial judges rulings on the admissibility of the evidence. 
    The trial judge also told the jury, both when the gang evidence was adduced
    and in his closing instructions, that the gang evidence was admissible exclusively
    on the question of motive.  He emphatically cautioned the jury against
    inferring guilt based upon the appellants criminal activities and gang
    association.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge thoroughly and carefully instructed the jury on the
    issues relating to the identification of the appellants as the persons who
    participated in the shooting of Mr. Noel.  He properly explained the concepts
    of aiding and abetting, and the <i>mens rea</i> for murder required by s.
    229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  No complaint is made with respect to any
    of these instructions.  The trial judges instructions on the issue of motive, specifically
    the use that the jury could make of the gang evidence, were also beyond
    reproach.  The jurys verdicts, placed in the context of the positions advanced
    by the parties, indicate that the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Sarrazin shot Mr. Noel with the intent necessary for the crime of murder,
    and that Mr. Jean aided and abetted Mr. Sarrazin with the <i>mens rea</i> necessary
    to make him a party to that murder.  </p>
  <h2>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE FAILURE TO INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT A FINDING OF GUILT ON ATTEMPTED
    MURDER WAS A POSSIBLE VERDICT</h2>
  <h3><span style='font-style:

style='font-style:normal'>The trial proceedings</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a murder charge, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the acts of the accused were a significant contributing cause of the victims
    death:  see <i>R. v. Nette</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488 at para. 72.  As summarized
    in the reasons of Moldaver J.A., there was strong evidence that the serious
    injuries caused by the gunshot wound to the abdomen and the subsequent
    surgeries necessitated by that wound were at least a significant contributing
    cause, if not the sole cause, of the fatal blood clot.  However, both Dr.
    Freeman, the surgeon, and Dr. Johnston, the pathologist who performed the
    autopsy, agreed that Mr. Noels death was unexpected.  Dr. Johnston also
    acknowledged on cross-examination that it was &quot;a possibility&quot; but not
    likely that the blood clot was caused by Mr. Noels cocaine ingestion shortly
    before his death, and that there was no causal connection between the gunshot
    wound and the subsequent surgeries, and the blood clot.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the concessions made by Dr. Johnston in his
    cross-examination, there was no evidence to support the contention that Mr.
    Noels cocaine ingestion had anything to do with his death.  Defence counsel
    suggested to Dr. Johnston that there would be defence expert medical evidence
    to support the contention that cocaine ingestion had caused Mr. Noels death;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During pre-charge discussions at the end of the evidence, counsel and
    the trial judge all agreed that causation was in play, meaning that, on the totality
    of the evidence, there was a realistic basis upon which a jury could have a
    reasonable doubt as to whether Mr. Noels death was caused by the gunshot wound
    and the subsequent surgeries.  Counsel did not, however, agree as to the
    potential consequences of any such reasonable doubt.  Defence counsel argued
    that the jury should be told that if it had a reasonable doubt on causation,
    but was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Sarrazin had shot Mr. Noel
    with the intention of killing him, it could convict both appellants of
    attempted murder.  Counsel submitted that an instruction on the offence of
    attempted murder in keeping with the principles in <i>R. v. Ancio</i>, [1984] 1
    S.C.R. 225 should be given to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel at trial initially agreed that an instruction on the
    offence of attempted murder was appropriate.  However, after further

    acquit the appellants if it had a reasonable doubt on the question of
    causation.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the pre-charge discussions, the trial judge expressed some doubt
    as to whether an accused could, as a matter of law, be convicted of attempted
    murder on a count alleging murder.  He referred to the relevant <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provisions (ss. 660- 662) and <i>R. v. Poole</i>, [1997] B.C.J. No.
    957 (B.C.C.A.).  The trial judge told counsel that, despite his uncertainty, he
    was prepared to instruct the jury on the offence of attempted murder if all counsel
    agreed that he should do so.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[25]<span

    Arbour J., writing for the majority in <i>Nette</i>, at para. 47, indicated without
    analysis and in <i>obiter dicta</i> that where causation was not proven, a
    proper verdict might be attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stewart, Crown counsel, with his usual candour, accepts that his submission
    that attempted murder is not an available verdict is somewhat counterintuitive
    and is fairly described as a technical argument.  The argument rests on a
    reading of ss. 660 and 662 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 660 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where the complete commission of an offence charged
    is not proved but the evidence establishes an attempt to commit the offence,
    the accused may be convicted of the attempt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This section, read on its own, could not be plainer.  It puts an accused
    on notice that he or she stands to be convicted of attempting to commit the
    offence with which he or she is charged, if the full offence is not proved but an
    attempt to commit that offence is proved.  Nothing in s. 660 suggests that it
    does not apply to a murder charge.  Section 660, standing alone, leaves no room
    for the Crowns argument that attempted murder is not an available verdict on a
    murder charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 662, however, arguably muddies the interpretative waters.  The
    relevant parts of that section read:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>662.(1)  A count in an indictment is divisible and <u>where
    the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating
    it or as charged in the count, includes the commission of another offence,</u> whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the accused may be
    convicted</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)  <u>of an offence so included that is proved</u>,
    notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)  <u>of an attempt to commit an offence so
    included</u>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)  For greater certainty and without limiting the
    generality of subsection (1), <u>where a count charges first degree murder and
    the evidence does not prove first degree murder but proves second degree murder
    or an attempt to commit second degree murder, the jury may find the accused not
    guilty of first degree murder but guilty of second degree murder or an attempt
    to commit second degree murder, as the case may be.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3)  Subject to subsection (4), where a count
    charges murder and the evidence proves manslaughter or infanticide but does not
    prove murder, the jury may find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of
    manslaughter or infanticide, <u>but shall not on that count find the accused
    guilty of any other offence.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4)  Where a count charges the murder of a child or
    infanticide and the evidence proves the commission of an offence under section
    243 but does not prove murder or infanticide, the jury may find the accused not
    guilty of murder or infanticide, as the case may be, but guilty of an offence
    under section 243 [concealing the body of a child].  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 662(1) describes in generic terms what are commonly referred to
    as lesser and included offences.  That section puts accused persons on notice
    that they could be convicted of any offences that fall within the language of s.
    662(1), or an attempt to commit any of those offences, even though those
    offences and attempts are not expressly set out in the indictment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While s. 662(1) speaks in general terms that apply to all offences
    charged in an indictment, ss. 662(2)-(6) identify certain specific offences and
    declare that persons charged with those offences are in jeopardy of being
    convicted of the offences specifically identified in the subsections.  For
    example, s. 662(5) provides that a person charged with an offence involving criminal
    negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle is liable to be convicted of
    dangerous driving, if criminal negligence is not made out but dangerous driving
    is proved.  Accused persons are liable to be convicted of the included offence
    of dangerous driving by virtue of the specific language of s. 662(5) even
    though dangerous driving may not be a lesser and included offence within the
    general language of s. 662(1).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 662(2), (3) and (4) describe offences that are included in a murder
    charge.  Section 662(2) declares that second degree murder and an attempt to

    murder.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    Sections 662(3) and (4) identify lesser offences that are also declared to be included
    in a murder charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel places considerable reliance on s. 662(2), which
    specifically provides that attempted second degree murder is an included
    offence in a charge of first degree murder.  He argues that s. 662(2) indicates
    that where Parliament intended that attempted murder should be a possible
    verdict on a murder charge, it has expressly said so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This submission reads too much into the section.  The section is intended
    to make it clear that second degree murder is a possible verdict on a first
    degree murder charge.  The reference in s. 662(2) to the possibility of a conviction
    for attempted second degree murder simply tracks the language of s. 662(1),
    which provides that where an accused is liable to be convicted of a lesser and
    included offence, he or she may also be convicted of an attempt to commit that
    lesser and included offence.  The words of s. 662(2) that make a conviction for
    attempted second degree murder possible simply make the provision conform with
    the general provision in s. 662(1) as it relates to potential liability for an
    attempt to commit a lesser and included offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with Mr. Campbell, co-counsel for Mr. Jean, that the inclusion
    of attempted second degree murder as a possible verdict on a first degree
    murder charge undermines the Crowns argument.  As Mr. Campbell observed, if
    the Crowns argument is correct, s. 662(2) creates the anomalous result that an
    accused charged with first degree murder may be convicted of attempted murder
    but that an accused charged with second degree murder cannot be so convicted.  Crown
    counsel has not suggested any justification for this distinction.<a

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel also relies on s. 662(3).  That section provides that a jury
    may convict a person charged with murder of manslaughter or infanticide but
    shall not on [the murder count] find the accused guilty of any other offence. 
    Crown counsel submits that these closing words of s. 662(3) preclude a conviction
    for attempted murder on a murder charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 662(3) is part of s. 662 and must be read in that context.  I
    think s. 662(3) serves to limit the general language of s. 662(1) by providing
    that only manslaughter or infanticide are available lesser and included
    offences.  Thus, for example, an accused cannot be convicted of assault causing
    bodily harm on a murder charge even though the charge of assault causing bodily
    harm might have been an included offence in the murder charge under the general
    language of s. 662(1):  see <i>R. v. Chichak</i> (1978), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 489
    (Alta. Sup. Ct. (App. Div.)).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the language of s. 662 addresses an accuseds potential
    liability for attempting to commit the murder with which that accused is charged. 
    Section 660 speaks directly to that potential liability.  Nothing in s. 662
    limits or qualifies the broad language of s. 660.  Although both sections
    address the same issue  possible verdicts  they speak to different aspects of
    that issue.  Section 660 directly addresses the accuseds potential liability for
    an attempt to commit the offence with which the accused is charged.  Section
    662 speaks to liability for offences that are lesser and included in the
    offence with which the accused is charged either by virtue of the general
    language of s. 662(1) or the specific provisions of ss. 662(2)-(6).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsels interpretation of ss. 660 and 662 is not without
    support.  No less of an authority than Justice H. E. Taschereau, in his seminal
    commentary on Canadas first <i>Criminal Code</i>, the<i> Criminal Code</i>,<i> 1892</i>, S.C. 55-56 Vic., c. 29, observed that s. 711, the predecessor to s.
    660, does not apply to murder.  In support of that observation, he referred
    to s. 713, the predecessor to s. 662:  see H. E. Taschereau, <i>The Criminal
    Code of Canada</i>, (Toronto, Ont.: Carswell, 1980).<a href="#_ftn8"

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel also relies on three appellate authorities.  I will deal
    with them in chronological order.  The first, <i>Chichak</i>, did not involve
    potential liability for attempted murder.  The question in <i>Chichak</i> was
    whether an accused who was charged with murder could be convicted of assault
    causing bodily harm.  The court held that on the language of s. 589(3) [now s.
    662(3)], an accused charged with murder could not be convicted of a lesser
    offence other than manslaughter or infanticide.  I need not take issue with the <i>ratio</i> in <i>Chichak</i>, which does not assist the Crown on the issue to
    be decided on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R. v. Duncan</i> (1984), 57 A.R. 362 (Alta. C.A.), the second case
    relied on by the Crown, is factually on point.  The accused was acquitted of
    murder on the basis that the trial judge had a doubt as to whether the victim
    had died from the stab wounds inflicted by the accused or from a pre-existing
    heart disease.  On a Crown appeal from the acquittal, the court held, relying
    on the language of s. 589(3) [now s. 662(3)], that a finding of guilt on the
    charge of attempted murder was not an available verdict on a murder charge. 
    The court made no reference to s. 587, the predecessor to s. 660.  Absent any reference
    to, much less analysis of, s. 660, I do not find the reasoning in <i>Duncan</i> to be persuasive on this point.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Poole</i>, the third case relied on by the Crown, was also a case
    where cause of death was in issue at trial.  In <i>Poole</i>, the accused and a
    third party, acting independently of each other, fired the same handgun at the
    victim during an altercation and the victims subsequent flight from the scene. 
    The shot fired by the third party struck and killed the victim.  The trial
    judge instructed the jury that the accused, whose shot had missed the victim, could
    only be convicted of attempted murder.  The jury returned a verdict of not
    guilty of murder but guilty of attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the Crown conceded that the
    trial judge had misdirected the jury as to the <i>mens rea</i> required for
    attempted murder.  The Crown argued, however, that attempted murder was an
    available verdict and that there should be a new trial on that charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Macfarlane J.A., writing for the court, rejected the Crowns submission
    for two reasons.  First, he concluded that on the evidence, and on the Crown's
    theory at trial, the transaction referred to in the murder charge was limited
    to the shot that caused the victims death.  On this view, the shot fired by
    the accused constituted a separate transaction.  Macfarlane J.A. held that an
    accused could not be convicted of an offence that arose out of a different
    transaction than the transaction giving rise to the allegation in the
    indictment.  This principle is not controversial, has been accepted in this
    court, and has no relevance to the outcome of this appeal:  see <i>R. v. Talbot</i> (2007), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 415 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 90.  In this case, the
    appellants potential liability for attempted murder clearly arises from the
    same transaction that gave rise to the murder charges.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second reason Macfarlane J.A. rejected the Crowns submission is
    directly germane to this appeal.  After setting out the relevant provisions of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, including ss. 660 and 662, Macfarlane J.A. referred
    to <i>Ancio</i> for the proposition that attempted murder requires an intention
    to kill, whereas the <i>mens rea</i> for murder required by s. 229(a)(ii) is less
    than an actual intent to kill.  He said at paras. 43-44: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The offences of
    second degree murder and attempted murder are fundamentally different.  Murder
    may be committed upon proof of a lesser intent than is required to support a
    charge of attempted murder.  <br>
    <br>
    Conceptually, attempted murder would not appear to be a lesser included offence
    of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stewart placed heavy reliance on this aspect of the reasoning in <i>Poole.  </i>As I understand his argument, because attempted murder requires proof of an
    intention to kill, whereas murder may be established either by proof of an
    intention to kill or proof of an intention to cause bodily harm knowing that it
    is likely to cause death and being reckless as to whether death ensues,
    attempted murder is not an included offence in the crime of murder.  According
    to Crown counsel, the difference in the <i>mens rea</i> components of attempted
    murder and murder makes the two crimes fundamentally different, such that
    attempted murder cannot be characterized as a lesser and included offence in
    the charge of murder.  It follows, according to this argument, that because
    attempted murder is not a lesser and included offence, it cannot be an
    available verdict under s. 660.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>mens rea</i> required for attempted murder is more limited than
    the <i>mens rea</i> that can support a conviction for murder.  In that sense,
    the two crimes are different.  This distinction is not, however, peculiar to
    the crime of murder.  All attempts are described in s. 24 and require proof of
    an intention to commit an offence.  The <i>mens rea</i> required for the
    corresponding completed offences will be found in the statutory provisions that
    create the offences and judicial interpretations of the relevant language. 
    While the matter does not appear to have been decided by the Supreme Court of
    Canada, there is an argument that attempts require proof of an actual intention
    to commit the offence, even if the completed offence requires only proof of
    recklessness or perhaps some lower level of <i>mens rea</i>:  see D. Stuart<i>,</i> <i>Canadian Criminal Law</i>, 5th ed. (Scarborough, Ont.: Carswell, 2007) at pp.
    662-666; <i>R. v. Janeteas</i> (2003), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) at para.
    30; E. Meehan and J. Currie, <i>The Law of Criminal Attempt</i>, at pp. 56  92.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I do not see that the difference in the <i>mens rea</i> requirements between attempted murder and murder has any relevance to the
    applicability of s. 660.   The Crowns argument assumes that s. 660 applies only
    to attempts that also qualify as lesser and included offences within the
    language used in s. 662(1).  Many cases have considered the meaning of the complicated
    language in s. 662(1) when determining whether a particular offence is a lesser
    and included offence of the charged offence:  see, for example, <i>R. v. G.R., </i>[2005]
    2 S.C.R. 371.  That complicated language is not found in s. 660.  Section 660
    provides a free-standing statutory basis upon which attempts to commit the
    offence charged are available verdicts if the offence charged is not proved.  Attempts
    are included offences in the sense that they are available verdicts under s.
    660.  They are not, however, subject to s. 662(1) and need not meet the
    criteria for a lesser and included offence under that section.  In my view, it
    is irrelevant to the operation of s. 660 whether an attempt to commit an
    offence qualifies as a lesser and included offence under the language of s.
    662(1).<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above, I would not follow <i>Poole</i>.  I do
    not think that the analysis of the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for attempted
    murder in <i>Ancio</i> has any bearing on whether s. 660 provides that a person
    charged with murder may be convicted of attempted murder if murder is not
    proved. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stewart also advances arguments not made in <i>Poole</i> or the
    other authorities on which he relies.  He submits that although the language of
    s. 660 may appear to be unqualified, there are certain offences to which s. 660
    clearly cannot apply.  For example, he points out that a person charged with
    conspiracy cannot be convicted under s. 660 of attempted conspiracy.  This
    argument is advanced to counter the suggestion that s. 660 is of general
    application to all charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that a person charged with conspiracy cannot be convicted
    of attempted conspiracy: see <i>R. v. Déry</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 669.   The unavailability
    of a conviction for attempt, however, has nothing to do with s. 660 or any
    other pleading provision in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  <i>Déry</i> holds that
    an attempt to conspire is not a crime.  As it is not a crime, a conviction for
    attempted conspiracy is not a possible verdict.  To acknowledge that s. 660
    does not contemplate a conviction for attempted conspiracy on an indictment
    charging conspiracy is simply to acknowledge that s. 660 does not create
    crimes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stewart also seeks to support the submission that the general
    language of s. 660 does not encompass attempted murder by asserting that
    attempted murder is treated differently than other attempts in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  He refers to s. 463, which sets out the general scheme for the
    punishment of criminal attempts, and compares it to s. 239, which creates a separate
    and significantly harsher sentencing scheme for attempted murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that there is a meaningful difference in how the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>treats attempted murder and other attempts.  Like all attempts, the
    requisite elements of the offence of attempted murder are found in s. 24 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Attempted murder, like other attempts, requires proof of
    an intent to commit an offence (s. 24(1)) and an act that goes beyond mere
    preparation (s. 24(2)):  see <i>R. v. Deutsch</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 2.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 239 is a penalty provision only:  see <i>R. v. Gordon</i> (2009), 94 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.) at para. 57.  The penalty provided for in s. 239
    reflects Parliaments determination that attempted murder is sufficiently
    serious to warrant a greater penalty than is normally attached to an attempt to
    commit a crime.  Parliament has made the same determination with respect to the
    crime of being an accessory after the fact to murder: s. 240 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite Mr. Stewarts able submissions, I am satisfied that, as a matter
    of statutory interpretation, s. 660 applies to a charge of murder.  Nothing in
    s. 662 detracts from the language of s. 660.  Read together, ss. 660 and 662
    (along with s. 661) put an accused on notice of the full extent of his or her
    potential liability on any particular charge.  They also allow the trier of
    fact to determine that liability in a single proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I base my conclusion that s. 660 applies to murder charges on
    the language of the relevant sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, my
    interpretation of s. 660 is further supported by practical and policy
    considerations.  There is nothing problematic from a practical standpoint about
    allowing the jury to consider an accuseds possible liability on a charge of
    attempted murder in the same proceeding in which it considers a murder charge. 
    The different intents required for the offence of murder and attempted murder would
    have to be explained to the jury.  However, this added complexity pales beside
    the level of complexity found in some instructions that are routinely given to
    juries.  I am confident that a jury could properly address the different
    intents required for the crimes of murder and attempted murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown does not suggest that there are any practical impediments to
    the determination of allegations of murder and attempted murder at the same
    trial.  The Crown submits, however, that the two allegations can be considered in
    the same trial only where the Crown chooses to include a separate charge of
    attempted murder, as it is entitled to do under s. 589 as long as the two
    allegations arise out of the same transaction.  Indeed, if the Crown had not
    withdrawn Count 2 in the indictment at the conclusion of the evidence, this
    jury would have had to consider Mr. Sarrazins liability for an offence that
    required that attempted murder be proved. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The position advanced by the Crown also carries with it significant
    negative policy ramifications.  On the Crowns position, these appellants could
    not have been convicted of attempted murder at this trial.  Had they been
    acquitted on the murder charge, the Crown could have proceeded at a subsequent
    trial on a charge of attempted murder.  Two separate trials to decide the ultimate
    culpability, if any, of the appellants in the shooting of Mr. Noel would
    unnecessarily consume limited judicial resources, prolong the criminal process
    and pose the very real risk of inconsistent findings of fact in the two
    proceedings.  The Crown might also take diametrically opposite positions on
    causation at the two trials, thereby potentially diminishing the repute of the
    administration of justice.  The community as a whole and the participants in a criminal
    proceeding, be they accused, witness, juror, or investigator, are best served
    by a process that allows all issues to be resolved in a single trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='background:white'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crowns contention that the jury could not consider the possibility
    of a conviction for attempted murder also carries a real risk of potential
    prejudice to an accused in the position of the appellants.  As indicated above,
    had the jury acquitted the appellants, the Crown could have proceeded at a
    subsequent trial on a charge of attempted murder.  At that trial, the Crown
    would once again try to prove that the appellants were criminally culpable in
    the shooting of Mr. Noel and that they had intended to kill him.  The Crowns
    position on these issues would be the same as that advanced at the first
    trial.  On the second trial, however, the Crown would presumably accept that it
    could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellants actions had
    caused Mr. Noels death.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='background:white'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the later trial, the appellants could not advance an issue estoppel
    claim based on their acquittals at the first trial as it would be impossible to
    isolate the basis upon which the jury had acquitted: see <i>R. v. Mahalingan,</i> [2008] 3 S.C.R. 316, <i>per</i> McLachlin C.J., at para. 54.  Consequently, even
    if the first jury had acquitted because it had a doubt as to whether the
    appellants had participated in the shooting, the appellants could be retried on
    the attempted murder charge and the Crown would have a second opportunity to
    prove that the appellants had participated in the shooting.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='background:white'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, s. 660 applies to murder charges.  Section 660 puts an
    accused charged with murder on notice that he or she is in jeopardy of being
    convicted of attempted murder if the Crown fails to prove the completed offence. 
    I would think that in most murder cases there will be no air of reality to the
    possibility of a conviction for attempted murder as causation will not be in
    dispute.  In those cases, it will be unnecessary to instruct the jury on the
    accuseds potential liability for attempted murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='background:white'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is one of those relatively unusual homicide cases in which there was
    a legitimate causation issue.  All parties at trial agreed that causation was in
    play.  There was a realistic possibility that the jury could have a doubt as
    to whether the appellants had caused Mr. Noels death.  I cannot agree with the
    submission made by Crown counsel on appeal, but not at trial, that although
    causation was an issue, [t]he defence of intervening cause of death...had no
    air of reality.  The defence was not required to prove an intervening cause of
    death.  The defence was only required to point to evidence that could raise a
    doubt as to whether the appellants actions had caused Mr. Noels death.  The
    evidence that Mr. Noels cocaine ingestion shortly before his death was a
    possible cause of death provided an evidentiary basis for that reasonable doubt. 
    If the jury had a doubt based on that evidence, I do not see how a verdict of
    not guilty of murder but guilty of attempted murder was not a realistic
    possibility.</p>
  <h2>IV.      THE APPLICATION OF THE CURATIVE PROVISO </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is an error in law to fail to instruct the jury on the law applicable
    to an included offence where, on the totality of the evidence, a verdict of not
    guilty on the full charge but guilty of the included offence is a realistic
    possibility: <i>R. v. Hughes</i>, [1942] S.C.R. 517 at pp. 523-24; <i>R. v.
    George</i>, [1960] S.C.R. 871; <i>R. v. Longson</i> (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 421
    at p. 425 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. De Champlain</i> (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 281 at p.
    283 (Que. C.A.); <i>R. v. Jackson</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at p. 431
    (Ont. C.A.), affd on this point, <i>R. v. Davy </i>(1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.)
    at p. 398.  In my view, the principle established in these cases has equal
    application where a trial judge fails to instruct a jury on potential liability
    for an attempt where, on the evidence, there is an air of reality to the claim
    that an accused is not guilty of the full offence, but is guilty of an attempt to
    commit the offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the appellant establishes an error in law, such as a failure to give
    a jury instruction that should have been given, the appellate court will set
    aside the appellants conviction unless the Crown can establish that the legal
    error occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice:  s.
    683(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>; <i>R. v. Illes</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R.
    134 at para. 21.  The Crown bears the onus of satisfying the appellate court
    that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been
    different had the legal error not been committed.  In other words, the Crown
    must show that the verdict would necessarily have been the same without the error. 
    If the Crown meets this burden, the error is said to be harmless and the
    conviction is upheld:  see <i>R. v. Colpitts</i>, [1965] S.C.R. 739, <i>per</i> Spence J., at p. 755; <i>R. v. Jolivet</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751 at para. 46; <i>R.
    v. Van</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716 at paras. 34-36.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In deciding whether the Crown has met its burden, the appellate court does
    not engage in a weighing of the evidence or an independent assessment of the
    ultimate merits of the case.  The appellate court must limit its inquiry to a
    determination of whether a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would
    necessarily have come to the same conclusion had the error not been made. 
    Professor Mewett explained the appellate function in this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But the jury is not free to come to arbitrary or
    unreasonable conclusions, and all that a court can decide is that, within the
    limits of what is reasonable, no jury would have acquitted, even absent the
    mistake.  Ruling on what is or is not reasonably supported by the evidence is
    not a factual determination but a legal determination.  It no more usurps the
    function of the jury than does deciding to withdraw an issue from the jury in
    the absence of any evidence to support it.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the Crown clearly carries a heavy burden to demonstrate the
    applicability of the curative proviso, the existence of the proviso is
    testimony to Parliaments determination that not all legal errors should vitiate
    convictions and necessitate new trials.  As Binnie J. explained in <i>Jolivet</i> at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Ordering a new trial raises significant issues for
    the administration of justice and the proper allocation of resources.  Where
    the evidence against an accused is powerful and there is no realistic
    possibility that a new trial would produce a different verdict, it is
    manifestly in the public interest to avoid the cost and delay of further
    proceedings.  Parliament has so provided.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recent Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence holds that the curative
    proviso is properly applied either where the evidence against an accused is
    overwhelming or where it can be safely said that the legal error had no impact
    on the verdict:  <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823 at paras. 28-31; <i>Van</i> at paras. 34-35.  In the first category of cases, the court determines, after a
    review of the evidence led at trial, that the Crowns case establishing the
    guilt of the accused is so overwhelming that no verdict other than a conviction
    was reasonably possible.  No matter the seriousness of the legal error, the
    accused has effectively lost nothing as a conviction was the only reasonable
    verdict and is therefore properly viewed as inevitable:  <i>R. v. P.L.S.</i>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909 at p. 916; <i>Khan</i> at para. 31; <i>R. v. Mahoney</i>, [1982]
    1 S.C.R. 834 at pp. 854-55, <i>per</i> McIntyre J.; A.W. Mewett, No
    Substantial Miscarriage of Justice at pp. 100-101.  Like my colleague,
    Moldaver J.A., I do not think the evidence in this case is so overwhelming that
    it could be said that a finding of guilt on the murder charge was the only reasonably
    available verdict had the jury been properly instructed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second category of cases where the proviso has been applied examines
    the effect of the legal error on the verdict by placing that error in the
    context of the trial.  As described by Arbour J. in <i>Khan</i> at para. 30:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In all those cases, the appellate courts were
    convinced that the error could have had no effect on the verdict.  <u>Because
    of the nature of the errors and of the issues with respect to which they were
    made, it was possible to trace their effect on the verdict and ensure that they
    made no difference.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In tracing the effect of an error on the verdict, appellate courts have
    relied on different features of the trial process, including the significance
    of the issue in respect of which the error was made, the positions taken by
    counsel at trial, and any insights afforded into the jury deliberations by the
    trial record: see, for example, <i>Illes</i> at paras. 22-23; <i>Van</i> at
    paras. 38-44; <i>R. v. Ellard</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 19 at paras. 44-48.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tracing exercise described in <i>Khan</i>, which seeks to determine
    the effect of the legal error, is necessarily somewhat speculative.  Any doubts
    as to the impact of the error must be resolved against the Crown, which carries
    the burden of demonstrating that the verdict would necessarily have been the
    same:  <i>R. v. Brooks</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 237, <i>per</i> Binnie J.,
    concurring, at para. 136; <i>Khan</i> at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In tracing the effect of the error on the verdict, an appellate court
    can consider factual findings implicit in a jurys verdict as long as the
    appellate court is satisfied that those findings were not tainted by the legal
    error:  <i>R. v. Haughton</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516.  For example, in deciding whether
    the curative proviso could be applied to an error in an instruction on
    self-defence, an appellate court could consider that the jury, properly
    instructed on the elements of planning and deliberation, had returned a verdict
    of guilty of first degree murder.  Implicit in that verdict is a finding that
    the accused had planned and deliberated the murder before it occurred.  If the
    appellate court was satisfied that the finding of planning and deliberation
    could not have been affected by the misdirection on self-defence, that finding
    of planning and deliberation could negate the possibility of a successful
    self-defence claim and justify the application of the curative proviso to the
    error in the self-defence instruction:  see <i>R. v. Pilon</i> (2009), 243
    C.C.C. (3d) 109 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 76.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the jury returned convictions on the murder charge, having
    been properly instructed on the causation issue and having been told that it
    could convict of murder only if it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the appellants had caused Mr. Noels death.  It is implicit in the verdicts
    that the jury made a finding of causation against the appellants.  Can the
    Crown rely on that finding to argue that the non-direction on possible
    liability for attempted murder occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage
    of justice?  Or, to put the issue somewhat differently, can it be said that the
    jury, having returned murder verdicts after being properly instructed on that
    charge, would never have reached the question of attempt, thereby making the
    failure to instruct the jury on attempted murder a harmless error?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a matter of pure logic, the jurys verdicts negate the possibility
    that the non-direction as to the appellants potential liability for attempted
    murder had any impact on the outcome of the trial.  The jury convicted the
    appellants of murder.  Had the jury been instructed on the offence of attempted
    murder, it would also have been told that it should consider liability for
    attempted murder only if it had a reasonable doubt on the question of
    causation.  Given the verdicts, the jury would never have reached the question
    of liability for attempt.  To put the same point somewhat differently, this
    jury was told it could only convict of murder if it was satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellants had caused Mr. Noels death.  The murder
    convictions indicate that the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on
    the causation issue.  That finding is inconsistent with liability for attempted
    murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is authority for the proposition that an appeal court can reason
    backward from the verdict and rely on a conviction on the full charge to excuse
    any misdirection or non-direction in respect of potential liability for
    included offences: see <i>R. v. Holcomb</i> (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 417 at pp. 419-20

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Jackson</i>, this court rejected the submission that a conviction
    on the charge of murder, after a proper instruction on the murder charge, rendered
    harmless the misdirections on potential liability for the included offence of
    manslaughter. The two accused, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Davy, had been charged with
    murder.  The trial judge told the jury that manslaughter was an available verdict,
    but misdirected the jury as to the legal principles applicable to a finding of
    liability for manslaughter.  In refusing to apply the curative proviso, this
    court said at p. 431:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Furthermore, in assessing the potential impact of
    the failure to direct on included offences, an appellate court <u>should not
    assume that a jurys fact-finding process involves a mechanistic analysis of
    the evidence without regard to the verdict which flows from the jurys findings
    of fact.</u> In a case of clear culpability, a jury might be well reluctant to
    make findings which result in an acquittal, but may regard those same findings
    as more palatable if they result in some form of liability.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only Mr. Davy appealed.  In <i>Davy</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada
    also refused to apply the curative proviso to the misdirections on the law of
    manslaughter.  McLachlin J., writing for the court, noted that the Crown argued
    that, as the jury was properly instructed on the elements of murder, its
    verdict on that charge overcame any deficiencies in the instruction on the
    included offence of manslaughter.  She said at pp. 397-98:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is also true that the jury found Davy guilty of
    murder, nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeal that one cannot be
    satisfied the verdict is just, given the failure of the trial judge to set out
    the basis for convicting Davy of manslaughter under s. 21(1) and (2) and the
    absence of any instruction that a party may be guilty of manslaughter even
    though the perpetrator is guilty of murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLachlin J., at p. 398, referred with approval to the observation of
    Lord Tucker in <i>Bullard v. The Queen</i>, [1957] A.C. 635 at 644:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Every man on trial for murder has the right to have
    the issue of manslaughter left to the jury if there is any evidence upon which
    such a verdict can be given.  <u>To deprive him of this right must of necessity
    constitute a grave miscarriage of justice and it is idle to speculate what
    verdict the jury would have reached.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLachlin J. then put her conclusion in the terms of the curative
    proviso at p. 398:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am not satisfied that it is clear that a jury,
    properly instructed, would necessarily have returned a verdict of second degree
    murder against Davy.  <u>He was entitled to have the verdict of manslaughter
    clearly put to the jury.  We cannot be certain that if this had been done, and
    notwithstanding the correct instruction on murder, that the verdict might not
    have been different.  This is consequently, not a proper case for the

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[80]<span

    in <i>Gilbert.</i> In that case, the jury was told that it could either convict
    of murder or acquit.  On appeal, the court held that a conviction for
    manslaughter was an available verdict on the evidence.  The majority further
    held that, despite the full and accurate instruction on the charge of murder,
    the jurys verdict on that charge did not render harmless the trial judge's
    failure to instruct on the included offence of manslaughter.  Chief Justice
    Gleeson and Gummow J. said at para. 16:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>These statements are inconsistent with the notion
    that an appellate court must assume, on the part of a jury, a mechanistic
    approach to the task of fact-finding, divorced from a consideration of the
    consequences.  Indeed, juries are ordinarily asked to return a general
    verdict.  <u>They make their findings of fact in the context of instructions as
    to the consequences of such findings, and for the purpose of returning a
    verdict which expresses those consequences.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    that the jurys verdict on the murder charge could be relied on to render a
    failure to instruct on manslaughter, harmless.  He said at paras. 96 and 101:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This is to recognise the reality <u>that a jury room
    might not be a place of undeviating intellectual and logical rigour.  It is not

    the House of Lords in <i>R. v. Coutts,</i> [2007] 1 Cr. App. R. 61 (H.L.).  In <i>Coutts,</i> the accused was charged with a particularly sordid murder and advanced the
    defence of accident. The trial judge instructed the jury that it could convict
    of murder or acquit.  Manslaughter was not left as a possible verdict.  Defence
    counsel apparently agreed manslaughter should not be left.  The Court of Appeal
    held that in the circumstances, it would have been unfair to the defence to
    instruct the jury on the included offence of manslaughter, and dismissed the
    accuseds appeal:  <i>R. v. Coutts</i>, [2005] 1 Cr. App. R. 517 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The House of Lords found that manslaughter was an available verdict on
    the evidence.  It further held that the failure to instruct the jury on the
    included offence of manslaughter constituted reversible error.  In coming to
    that conclusion, the court specifically overruled its earlier judgment in <i>R.
    v. Maxwell</i> (1991), 91 Cr. App. R. 61 (H.L.) at p. 68, which had held that
    an appellate court could rely on a conviction on a main charge to render
    non-direction on an included offence harmless, unless the appellate court was
    satisfied that the conviction on the main charge reflected the jurys
    reluctance to see the accused get clean away.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the path taken in <i>Davy</i> and in <i>Gilbert</i>, the Law
    Lords in <i>Coutts</i> declined to speculate as to why the jury had convicted
    on the full charge and what the impact of an instruction on the included
    offence of manslaughter might have been.  Instead, the court focussed on the
    jurys right to consider all verdicts that were reasonably available on the
    evidence.  Lord Bingham indicated at para. 12:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The interests of justice are not served if a
    defendant who has committed a lesser offence is either convicted of a greater
    offence, exposing him to greater punishment than his crime deserves, or
    acquitted altogether, enabling him to escape the measure of punishment which
    his crime deserves.  <u>The objective must be that defendants are neither
    over-convicted nor under-convicted, nor acquitted when they have committed a
    lesser offence of the type charged.  The human instrument relied on to achieve
    this objective in cases of serious crime is of course the jury.  But to achieve
    it in some cases the jury must be alerted to the options open to it.</u> 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Bingham went on to hold, at para. 23, that an instruction on an
    included offence should be given where there is clearly sufficient evidence to
    support that verdict.  In rejecting the contention that the jurys verdict on
    the full offence was a complete answer to any complaint with respect to
    non-direction on the included offence, Lord Bingham observed at para. 25:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court of Appeal rightly recognised the high
    sense of public duty which juries customarily bring to their task.  I would not
    wish to belittle that in any way.  <u>But one does not belittle it to decline
    (as the High Court of Australia has done) to attribute to juries an adherence
    to principle and an obliviousness to consequences which is scarcely attainable.</u> 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Rodger, in concurring reasons, echoed the language of the majority
    in <i>Gilbert</i> and the sentiment underlying <i>Davy</i> when he explained,
    at para. 89:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Counsel for the Crown] says that the additional
    choice is irrelevant since the jury convicted the appellant of murder and so
    they would never have reached the question of manslaughter, which only arose if
    they were not prepared to convict of murder.  <u>But that is to make an unreal
    assumption that, at all stages of their deliberations, the jury would keep the
    various issues in separate boxes, to be considered in a prescribed order.  The
    reality is that, in the course of their deliberations, a jury might well look
    at the overall picture, even if they eventually had to separate out the issues
    of murder, manslaughter and accident.  So, introducing the possibility of
    convicting of manslaughter could have changed the way the jury went about
    considering their verdict.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Davy</i>, and the cases from Australia and England that have followed <i>Davy</i>, establish that the Crown, when tracing the effect of the failure
    to properly instruct the jury on liability for an included offence, cannot
    automatically rely on factual findings implicit in the jurys verdict on the
    main charge.  Instead, the Crown must demonstrate, pursuant to its burden under
    the curative proviso, that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict
    on the main charge was influenced by the misdirection or non-direction with
    respect to potential liability for an included offence.  On this analysis, the
    failure to afford a jury an opportunity to consider returning a verdict on an
    included offence, where that verdict is reasonably available, will in most
    circumstances constitute reversible error unless the Crown can show that it had
    an overwhelming case on the main charge.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"

    While <i>Davy</i> and the other authorities all involve errors in respect of
    the included offence of manslaughter, I think the same analysis applies in this
    case to the appellants potential liability on the charge of attempted murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I come now to <i>Haughton</i>, the authority primarily relied on by my
    colleague, Moldaver J.A., in support of his conclusion that the curative
    proviso can be applied in this case.  <i>Haughton</i> has much in common with <i>Davy</i>. 
    In both cases, the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the main charge
    of murder, but misdirected the jury on the law applicable to the included
    offence of manslaughter.  In both cases, the possibility of a conviction on the
    lesser and included offence of manslaughter was left with the jury and, in both
    cases, the jury convicted of murder.  In <i>Davy</i>, as noted above, the court
    rejected the Crowns contention that the jurys conviction on the murder charge
    rendered any misdirection on manslaughter harmless.  In <i>Haughton</i>, the
    court looked to the conviction on the main charge to support the application of
    the curative proviso to a misdirection on manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not regard <i>Haughton</i> as a jurisprudentially significant
    case.  It is a one-paragraph oral judgment in which the legal error to which
    the proviso is applied is not even identified.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[12]</span></span></span></a> 
    I read <i>Haughton</i> as an application of the curative proviso that is
    consistent with the jurisprudence both before and after <i>Haughton</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I understand the reasons in <i>Haughton</i>, Sopinka J., for the
    court, was satisfied for two reasons that the factual findings implicit in the
    murder conviction were not undermined by the misdirection on manslaughter. 
    First, because the jury was left with the possible verdict of guilty of
    manslaughter, it could not be said that the conviction on the murder charge was
    potentially the product of the jurys reluctance to see the accused escape
    liability entirely.  Second, the finding implicit in the murder conviction that
    the appellant had the requisite subjective foresight of death required for
    murder could not have been affected by an erroneous instruction with respect to
    the lesser <i>mens rea</i> required for manslaughter.  <i>Haughton</i> does not
    turn exclusively on the fact that manslaughter was left as a possible verdict,
    but also looks at the potential impact of the specific legal error made by the
    trial judge on the <i>mens rea</i> finding implicit in the jurys verdict of
    guilty of murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think that <i>Haughton</i> pronounces that, in every case where
    an included offence is left with a jury and the jury convicts on the main
    charge, the appellate court may take the findings of fact implicit in that
    verdict into account in deciding whether a legal error in the instruction on
    potential liability for an included offence resulted in no substantial wrong or
    miscarriage of justice.  To read <i>Haughton</i> that broadly would be to
    render legal errors in respect of instructions on included offences irrelevant
    if the jury convicted on the main offence.  It would also mean that <i>Davy</i> was implicitly overruled by <i>Haughton</i>.  <i>Davy </i>was decided only 10
    months before <i>Haughton</i>.  All seven members of the unanimous court in <i>Haughton</i> were part of the unanimous nine-person court in <i>Davy</i>.  There is no
    mention of <i>Davy </i>in <i>Haughton</i>.  I conclude that <i>Haughton</i> was
    not intended to in any way detract from the authority of <i>Davy</i>.  I see no
    inconsistency in the two judgments.  Both address the curative proviso by
    asking whether the Crown can demonstrate that the legal error had no effect on
    the verdict.  In the circumstances of <i>Davy</i>, the court was not prepared
    to accept the findings of fact implicit in the jurys verdict in deciding
    whether to apply the curative proviso.  In the different circumstances of <i>Haughton</i>,
    the court was prepared to accept those findings for the purposes of the curative
    proviso analysis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In holding that the failure to instruct the jury on potential liability
    for the offence of attempted murder occasioned no substantial wrong, Moldaver
    J.A. stresses that the jury was instructed that the appellants could be
    convicted of the included offence of manslaughter.  The jury was told that
    manslaughter was a possible verdict if the appellants caused Mr. Noels death,
    but the Crown failed to prove the <i>mens rea</i> required for murder. 
    Moldaver J.A. observes that the instruction on the included offence of
    manslaughter meant that this jury was not faced with the stark choice of convicting
    the appellants of murder or acquitting them outright.  Consequently, the
    finding of fact in respect of causation implicit in the jurys verdicts cannot
    have been the product of the jurys determination to avoid setting the
    appellants free entirely, but must have been a true reflection of their
    assessment of the relevant evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot agree that, since the jury was instructed to convict the
    appellants of manslaughter if it had a doubt regarding intent, the Crown has
    demonstrated that this court can safely rely on the causation finding implicit
    in the jurys verdicts of guilty of murder.  The manslaughter instruction was
    only relevant to the jurys deliberations if the jury was satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellants had caused Mr. Noels death.  The
    manslaughter instruction was directed at the appellants mental state and left
    it open to the jury to convict the appellants of manslaughter if the Crown had proved
    causation beyond a reasonable doubt but had not proved the <i>mens rea</i> required
    for murder.  I do not see how an instruction as to manslaughter that becomes
    relevant only after a finding of causation and which focuses on the appellants
    mental state can cure a misdirection on the consequences of the jurys finding
    with respect to causation.  Nothing in the instruction linked the possibility
    of manslaughter to the jurys causation inquiry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My concern, and I think the primary concern of the courts in <i>Gilbert</i> and <i>Coutts</i>, is not that the jury would deliberately disregard the trial
    judges instructions and search out some middle ground verdict to ensure that an
    unsympathetic accused was punished for something even though he may not have
    been guilty of anything in the eyes of the law.  My concern is that a jurys
    fact-finding on a specific issue such as causation could be subconsciously
    influenced by what it is told about the legal consequences of that
    fact-finding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manslaughter instructions directed at a possible doubt regarding the
    mental state required for murder do not allay my concern that the jurys
    finding of fact on the distinct question of causation may have been influenced
    by an instruction that a reasonable doubt regarding causation should lead to
    the appellants outright acquittal.  This is not a case like <i>Haughton </i>where
    the possibility of a manslaughter conviction arose out of the same factual
    issue - the accused's mental state - as did the legal error.  In that
    situation, I find it much easier to infer that the jury's finding against an
    accused was not the product of the jury's unwillingness to let the accused
    escape entirely.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In coming to my conclusion, I do not suggest that the jury was in fact
    influenced by what it was told about the consequences of its fact-finding on
    the causation issue.  I mean only to say that there is sufficient uncertainty
    as to whether the jurys fact-finding on the question of causation was tainted
    by the non-direction on attempted murder to cause me to conclude that the Crown
    cannot rely on the implicit finding of causation in the jurys verdict in seeking
    to demonstrate that the non-direction caused no substantial wrong or
    miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above, I do not regard this case as one in which
    the Crown can rely on findings of fact implicit in the verdict to demonstrate that
    a legal error occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The
    verdict does not assist the Crown in tracing the effect of the error.  The
    curative proviso analysis should be undertaken without regard to any findings
    of fact implicit in the verdicts returned by the jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Moldaver J.A. that causation was a secondary issue at
    trial.  I also agree that the evidence on the causation question strongly
    favoured the Crowns position.  That said, I again agree with Moldaver J.A. that
    this is not a case where the curative proviso can be applied on the basis that
    the Crowns case against the appellants was overwhelming.  I note that this is
    the sole argument advanced by Mr. Stewart in support of his contention that the
    proviso should be applied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My analysis of the possible application of the curative proviso comes
    down to this.  On all of the medical evidence, Mr. Noels death was entirely
    unexpected.  From a medical standpoint, the jury could conclude that his death
    was a puzzle and its cause far from obvious.  It was open to the jury to prefer
    the opinion of the pathologist, Dr. Johnston, who had the benefit of his
    observations during the post-mortem and the subsequent pathology reports, over
    the opinion of the surgeon, Dr. Freeman, who was not familiar with the evidence
    gathered post-mortem.  On Dr. Johnstons evidence, Mr. Noels cocaine ingestion
    was a possible, although not a probable, cause of death.  The trial judge
    correctly told the jury that it could find the appellants liable for Mr. Noels
    death only if the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellants
    had caused Mr. Noels death.  Dr. Johnstons opinion arguably stood directly in
    the way of the Crowns meeting that burden.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given Dr.
    Johnstons evidence, I cannot be satisfied that the failure to properly
    instruct the jury on the legal consequences of its giving effect to Dr.
    Johnstons opinion caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. 
    During the pre-charge discussions as to whether the offence of attempted murder
    should be left with the jury, the trial judge observed that an instruction on
    potential liability for attempted murder would inure to the benefit of the
    appellants and that the appellants would be prejudiced should he decide not to
    give that direction.  Crown counsel at trial agreed with the trial judges
    observation.  I think they were right in their assessment of the impact of the
    failure to instruct on potential liability for attempted murder.  There was a
    realistic possibility that prejudice would flow to the appellants from that
    non-direction. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also
    cannot agree that the Crowns position on the application of the proviso is
    improved because the causation issue was thoroughly explored by counsel at
    trial and was, except for the error discussed above, the subject of a careful
    and fair instruction by the trial judge.  The treatment of the issue of
    causation by counsel and the trial judge demonstrates that, while it was a
    secondary issue, it was still very much a live issue at trial.  That same
    treatment makes the failure to properly instruct the jury as to the legal
    consequences of its findings on causation more significant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would
    not apply the curative proviso.  </p>
  <h2>V.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think
    the appeal must be allowed and the verdicts set aside.  Given that the jury was
    fully and properly instructed on all issues other than causation, one might
    think that the re-trial could be limited to the question of causation. 
    Unfortunately, the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> do not
    permit this court to place any restrictions on the new trial: see <i>R. v.
    Thomas</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 535 at para. 28.  Consequently, there must be a
    third trial at which all of the relevant legal and factual issues may be
    re-litigated.  I would order a new trial for both appellants on the charge of
    second degree murder. </p>

  <h2>THE CURATIVE PROVISO</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have
    read the detailed and scholarly reasons of my colleague Doherty J.A. and I
    agree with his analysis and conclusions on the substantive issues raised by the
    appellants. Respectfully, however, I am unable to agree with my colleague on
    the application of the curative proviso. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of
    our mutual conclusion that the trial judge erred in law in failing to instruct
    the jury on the offence of attempted murder, the application of the curative
    proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires the
    court to consider whether a jury properly instructed could, acting reasonably,
    have come to a different conclusion absent the error. See <i>R. v. Haughton</i>,
    [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516 per Sopinka J.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I mention <i>Haughton</i> because, as will be seen, <i>Haughton</i> speaks to the application of the
    proviso in cases where an included offence (or in this case a lesser offence)
    is not left with the jury and the jury convicts of a more serious offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recent cases have expanded on the general principle enunciated in <i>Haughton</i>.
    Two types of situations have now been identified in which the proviso will
    generally be applied: (1) where the evidence pointing to the guilt of the
    accused is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict; and
    (2) where the error of law is trivial or, if more serious, can be said to have
    had no effect on the verdict and caused <br clear=all>
    no prejudice to the accused. See for example, <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.
    823 at paras. 29&#8209;31 and <i>R. v. Trochym</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239 at
    para. 81.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his
    able argument for the Crown, Mr. Stewart submitted that the proviso could
    safely be applied here because the evidence of causation  that the gunshot
    injuries sustained by Apaid Noel caused or substantially contributed to the
    formation of the blood clot that resulted in his death  was so overwhelming
    that no properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could have come to any
    different conclusion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I am unable to accept that submission. The evidence called
    at trial  and particularly that of Dr. Brian Johnston, the pathologist who
    performed the autopsy on Apaid Noel  does not permit that conclusion. As will
    be discussed further, Dr.&nbsp;Johnstons evidence was that he could not
    discount the possibility that the blood clot that caused Apaids death was
    unrelated to the gunshot injuries he suffered, but was instead the result of an
    unknown quantity of cocaine he ingested a short time before his death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    face of that evidence, much as I think that Dr. Johnston was being
    ultra-cautious in his reluctance to completely rule out the ingestion of
    cocaine as being the sole cause of the clot, I cannot say that the Crown has
    met its onerous burden of showing that the evidence of causation is so
    overwhelming that a new trial would be an exercise in futility. However, I do
    take Dr. Johnstons evidence of the remoteness of the cocaine-alone
    possibility into account in concluding that the harmless error branch of the
    proviso can be applied to sustain the convictions. To that end, I propose to
    review the evidence pertinent to the causation issue.</p>

    In <i>R. v. Sarrazin </i>(2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 485 (C.A.), the only mention of
    causation appears at para. 2, where Blair J.A. simply notes that after being
    shot in the early morning hours of February 19, 1998, Apaid Noel died 26 days
    later of a pulmonary embolism suffered after treatment and release from
    hospital <i>but nonetheless caused by the shooting</i> (emphasis added).  It
    seems that in the timeframe between the first appeal in 2004 and the second
    trial in 2006, the medical profession gained greater insight into the risks of
    blood clotting associated with the use of cocaine. Dr.&nbsp;Johnston
    acknowledged this at the re-trial in cross-examination by Ms. Mulligan, counsel
    for Mr.&nbsp;Sarrazin:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        And just to be fair to you, the last time
      we discussed this back in 2000, the reason I started with the suggestion to you
      that medical knowledge continues to advance, the last time we were here, you
      were unaware of the fact that cocaine could cause the kind of hypercoagulability
      [propensity for blood clotting], right?</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        Thats correct.</p>

  <p class=ParaNO0>This new-found knowledge opened the door for the defence to

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The causation issue is not open-ended. It begins with certain undisputed

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    early morning hours of February 19, 1998, Apaid Noel, age 19, was shot twice at
    close range with a .12 gauge sawed-off shotgun: once in the arm and once in the
    abdomen. The gunshot wound to Apaids arm was serious but non-life-threatening.
    The wound to his abdomen was both serious and life-threatening.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apaid was
    taken to the Ottawa General Hospital where Dr. Joel Freeman, a distinguished
    surgeon, operated on his abdominal wounds. Apaids liver had been softened and
    separated by the shotgun blast and Dr. Freeman removed as much foreign material
     pellets and wadding  as he safely could before closing the wound site. In
    his view, the remaining foreign material could be left inside the liver without
    undue risk.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to
    the shooting, Apaid was fit and otherwise healthy. In the first few days after
    his surgery, he did well. However, his progress stalled and on March 5,
    Dr.&nbsp;Freeman performed a second abdominal surgery in which he removed scar
    tissue blocking Apaids intestine. While doing so, Dr. Freeman examined the
    liver repair and found it to be perfect. On March 13, Apaid was released from
    the hospital. Prior to his release, he had been taking a blood thinner to
    prevent the formation of clots. Dr. Freeman stopped this medication on March 10
    and on March 13, the date of Apaids discharge, he regarded Apaid as having no
    risk of clotting. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A mere
    five days later, however, Apaid died from a massive blood clot that blocked the
    flow of blood to his lungs. According to Dr. Johnston, the fatal clot formed in
    Apaids veins, travelled to his heart, entered his pulmonary artery and
    completely blocked the two branches of that artery that supply fresh blood to
    the lungs. According to members of Apaids family who were at his side when he
    died, death came quickly. Apaid clutched his chest and lost consciousness
    almost immediately.  Dr. Johnston confirmed that when blood is unable to reach
    the lungs, death will ensue rapidly, sometimes preceded by an inability to
    breathe and lapses into unconsciousness.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blood
    samples taken from Apaid at the time of the autopsy revealed trace amounts of
    cocaine in his cardiac blood. According to Dr. Johnston, such traces will
    disappear from the cardiac blood within 30 to 45 minutes of consumption. Hence,
    Apaid would have ingested some amount of cocaine  how much Dr. Johnston could
    not say  very shortly before he died.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Johnston detected no signs that Apaid was a regular cocaine user.  In
    particular, he saw no needle marks on Apaids body, his arteries showed no
    indication of hardening, and there were no cocaine metabolites in his blood.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Freeman, who testified at trial, regarded death from a blood clot in a patient
    such as Apaid to be totally unexpected and a freak occurrence. Apaid was
    young, he had been healing well and he was ambulatory. The case was
    sufficiently puzzling to Dr.&nbsp;Freeman that he presented it to the
    hospitals morbidity conference.  None of the physicians in attendance had
    heard of anything comparable.</p>
  <h2>            <i>(iii)     Contentious Issues Related to Causation</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The debate
    between the Crown and defence at trial centred primarily on the reason or
    reasons why the clot had formed. Sub-issues included when the clot had formed
    and where in Apaids body it had originated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Freeman was adamant that the blood clot that killed Apaid would not have
    occurred had Apaid not been shot and required surgery:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        Right. In your opinion, what led to the
      formation of the clot, the pulmonary embolism, that killed Apaid Noel?</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        What led  his initial  if he hadnt
      have had an operation, he wouldnt have formed it. Is that .</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        Thank you. And youve told us why
      operations and multiple operations lead to forming clots, if he had not been
      shot and then had to have the operation and so forth, if hed not been shot
      would he have died of his pulmonary embolism?</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        No.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Freeman was certain that the clot was linked to the surgeries and the gunshot
    wounds. In his opinion, the clot likely formed in Apaids pelvis or femoral
    veins while he was hospitalized, probably between his first and second
    operations. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Johnston did not share Dr. Freemans opinion about the timing or location of
    the clot formation. His post-mortem examination revealed that the clot was
    fresh. In his view, it had formed no later than 48 hours before Apaids death
    and probably sooner, perhaps within 24 hours. Moreover, Dr. Johnston saw no
    evidence of clotting in the pelvis or femoral veins and nothing from which he
    could infer that a clot may have passed through those veins.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Dr. Johnston, wherever the clot formed in Apaids body, it did so in his
    veins, not in his arteries. Upon sectioning the liver (a procedure Dr. Freeman
    would not have been privy to), Dr. Johnston found what appeared to be
    relatively fresh clotting around foreign material that was lodged in Apaids
    liver, specifically wadding and pellets that Dr.&nbsp;Freeman had decided not
    to remove in the first operation. Dr. Johnston offered the following
    explanation for the clotting around the foreign material:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[O]n the inside of the liver, theres still some
    red stuff around this foreign material, and that stands to reason because the
    body has to somehow wall off the foreign material, and as part of the healing
    process, the body will start developing small blood vessels, and these are very
    fragile thin wall or blood vessels which might continue to leak and bleed. So,
    there is to be some bleeding expected as part of a long-term healing process. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Eventually, if things go properly, all of the
    foreign material should be walled off by scar tissue, but that may take months
    or even a year or so. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        And is clotting, then, part of that
      ongoing healing process?</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        Thats correct.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    end, Dr. Johnston formed the opinion that the clot that killed Apaid must have
    formed in the small branches of the hepatic vein located in the liver. His
    reasons for coming to this conclusion were three-fold:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="ParaNO0">(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He saw no external manifestations of blood clots in the veins of
      Apaids legs or arms.</p>
    <p class="ParaNO0">(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The area of injury in Apaids liver was the only place where he saw
      blood clots.</p>
    <p class="ParaNO0">(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On microscopic examination, the smaller branches of the hepatic vein
      appeared to be dilated, without any inflammation, and the hepatic vein itself was
      very dilated  which might indicate that a blood clot passed through it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, Dr. Johnston deduced that the site of the blood clot had to be
    the liver:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[B]ecause we dont have a demonstrable source of
    the origin of the blood clot except in the area of injury in the liver, I
    concluded that the blood clot undoubtedly came from the liver and not from
    somewhere else. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination by Ms. Mulligan, Dr. Johnston was asked about the role of
    platelets in the healing process. He responded that platelets are tiny elements
    in the blood that migrate to areas of injury to try and prevent bleeding.
    They stick together and promote clotting, which prevents bleeding, and thus
    loss of blood, in areas that are injured and that require blood to repair damaged
    tissues.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Johnston agreed in cross-examination that blood clots can form in people who
    are not injured or healing, for example, in individuals who produce too many
    platelets. He further acknowledged that cocaine ingestion can cause
    hypercoagulability, a term used to describe a propensity in someone to
    develop blood clots. Cocaine, he agreed, even in small doses, can cause blood
    platelets to become excited or the blood to hypercoagulate and
    hypercoagulability causes platelets to stick together, which causes clots to
    form.  While Dr. Johnston did not know how common it was for blood clots to
    form as a result of cocaine ingestion, he thought it would not be very common,
    but it certainly can happen.  He then conceded that, although he considered it
    unlikely, it was possible that the clot that killed Apaid may have had no
    relationship to his injuries or surgeries:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        Okay. So, given that we had a young man
      here with a clot, the source of which you could not determine definitively,
      youre not really able to rule out cocaine as having caused the clot to form,
      right?</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        <i>I guess that is true, yes</i>.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        Because, although  its a little
      difficult in Mr. Noels case because hes had these injuries, hes had surgery,
      and then a month later hes deceased. It would be clearer if hed had these
      injuries, had surgery, and a month later he walked out and was hit by a bus.
      Wed be able to say, you know, theres no relationship.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        Correct.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        Here it is possible that his ingestion of
      cocaine is just like getting hit by that bus. The clot may have no relationship
      to any of the surgery or any of the injuries.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        <i>Its possible. I wouldnt think itd
      be likely, but its possible</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a later
    point in her cross-examination, Ms. Mulligan asked Dr. Johnston if he knew a
    Dr. Markestein.  Dr. Johnston acknowledged that he did and that
    Dr.&nbsp;Markestein was a respected pathologist. She then put a question to Dr.
    Johnston in which she purported to summarize what Dr. Markestein would say
    about the clot if asked, namely: that death was most likely caused by the
    ingestion of cocaine resulting in hypercoagulability, which caused the clot.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[15]</span></span></span></a> 
    Crown counsel objected to this question. Discussion occurred in the absence of
    the jury and upon the jurys return, Ms. Mulligan reframed the question and
    engaged in the following exchange with Dr. Johnston:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        Okay, Im going to try it a different
      way. Im going to put it sort of in a hypothetical way. Hypothetically, looking
      at the evidence that you had at the time of the autopsy, the medical reports,
      everything that you had in front of you, can you categorically disagree with my
      suggestion that the clot did not emanate from the legs, its very unlikely that
      it emanated from the liver, and that the most likely cause was the ingestion of
      cocaine causing hypercoagulability of the blood?</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        Okay. <i>Cocaine was always a possibility</i>.
      The reason why  and I still think that the injury to the liver, which caused a
      blood clot to be propagated, is the most likely source of the thromboembolism 
      is that, yes, <i>cocaine causes a hypercoagulable state, or any problem with
        that, the effects of cocaine tend to be mostly on the smooth muscle of
        arteries, which causes spasm and damage to the inner lining, and a lot of blood
        clots are formed as the result of cocaine mostly in arteries</i>. Thats not to
      say they cant arise in veins; they certainly can.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">So, <i>even though I agree with the possibility, I
      still think the liver injury is the most likely source of the clot rather than
      it being an effect of cocaine. For other reasons, in that I did not see
      evidence of blood clots in other organs, in other small blood vessels
      throughout all the organs of the body that I sampled during the time of autopsy</i>.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote"><i>Can you have it in one particular area and cause
      a vein to thrombose and the blood clot to go up into the lungs and cause
      pulmonary embolism as a result of cocaine? Yes. But if were talking about a
      generalized hypercoagulable state, I would expect to see manifestations in
      other organs, and not to say they have to be. I would expect to see that</i>.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">So, <i>although cocaine remains in the realm of
      possibility  and I dont discount that  I think, again, the most likely
      source is the injured liver, and thats what I will maintain and continue to
      express as my opinion</i>.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        All right. Even though, doctor, youve
      agreed that you cant say with any degree of certainty that, in fact, the
      thrombosis  sorry, thromboembolism came from the liver.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        Thats right.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">Q.        So, you would agree that it is an issue
      in this particular case as to whether cocaine or the injury to the liver was
      the, I suppose the cause of the clot, youd agree its an issue about which
      reasonable pathologists could disagree.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">A.        Correct.</p>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote">[Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum,
    Dr. Johnston remained of the view that the clot that killed Apaid formed in his
    liver and resulted from trauma associated with the gunshot injuries. Although
    he could not discount the possibility that the clot may have formed
    independently by reason of cocaine ingestion, he considered this unlikely
    because clotting from cocaine typically occurs in the arteries, not the veins,
    and because hypercoagulability caused by cocaine is usually generalized, such
    that if it existed, clotting elsewhere in Apaids body should have been seen,
    but was not.</p>
  <h2>            <i>(iv)      Options Available to the Jury on Causation</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury
    had available to it the following options on the issue of causation. On the
    defence side of the ledger, the appellants had to be acquitted if the jury
    believed or had a reasonable doubt that within 30 to 45 minutes of ingesting an
    unknown quantity of cocaine, Apaid died from a massive veinous clot that formed
    in an area of his body unrelated to the areas where he had been shot and
    independent of the gunshot injuries he had sustained.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the
    Crowns side of the ledger, in order to find causation, the jury had to be
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the gunshot injuries caused or
    substantially contributed to the formation of the clot that killed Apaid. 
    There were two ways in which the jury could arrive at that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the
    jury could accept the opinions of Dr. Johnston and Dr. Freeman that the gunshot
    injuries had a direct bearing on the formation of the fatal clot.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the jury could find that the cocaine which Apaid ingested increased his
    platelet count and in turn, promoted clotting in those areas of the liver where
    Dr.&nbsp;Johnston believed the clot had formed. The fact that the cocaine may
    have exacerbated the formation of clotting in the liver was, in my view, an
    inference that the jury could legitimately draw from the evidence, even though
    Dr. Johnston was not specifically asked to address the matter.</p>
  <h2>II.        The Error was Harmless</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    I should not be taken as suggesting that a failure to leave a lesser available

    such an error will necessitate a new trial. Here, however, I believe that the
    failure to leave attempted murder with the jury was harmless in its effect
    because of five factors that are particular to this case. Taken together, they
    satisfy me that the proviso can safely be applied. They are as follows:</span></p>

      need to consider it with care.</span></p>

      which the jury was pursuing its task and the attention it was paying to the
      smallest detail.</span></p>

    case for the Crown may not have been overwhelming, the evidence favouring the
    Crowns position on causation readily surpassed the evidence favouring the

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    central to understanding the potential harm created by the trial judges

    principle is that the curative proviso will generally not be available in cases
    where an included offence (or in this case, a lesser offence) is not left with
    the jury and the jury convicts of a more serious offence. Ironically, this
    principle comes from <i>R. v. Haughton, </i>a case in which the issue did not
    arise. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    degree murder in connection with the death of a store owner who was bludgeoned
    to death in the course of a robbery. Counsel at trial agreed that whoever
    killed the store owner was guilty of murder and the Crown maintained that
    Haughton acted alone. Haughton testified and acknowledged his participation in
    the robbery, but claimed that an associate, whom he identified as Freddy, was
    responsible for killing the store owner. Haughton admittedly knew that Freddy
    had armed himself with a steel bar for purposes of overcoming any resistance
    they might encounter in the robbery. However, he denied knowing that Freddy
    would commit murder as a possible consequence of the robbery. The trial judge
    instructed the jury on murder, as well as the included offence of manslaughter,

    manslaughter as a party under s.&nbsp;21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. 
    Nonetheless, he was satisfied that the curative proviso could safely be applied
    to uphold Haughtons conviction for murder. In his view, the evidence that

    overwhelming. At p. 628, after reviewing the whole of the evidence, including
    Haughtons evidence, Doherty J.A. observed: the conclusion that the appellant

      have come to a different conclusion absent the error. In applying this test the
      findings of the jury in the case under appeal may be a factor in determining
      what the hypothetical reasonable jury would have done, provided those findings
      are not tainted by the error. <i>In cases in which an included offence is not
        left with the jury, a conviction by the jury of the more serious offence cannot
        generally be relied on by reason of the fact that it may very well be a
        reaction against a complete acquittal. There is an apprehension that the jury
        convicted because they had no other alternative than acquittal and acquittal
        was unpalatable. In this case, the jury had an alternative: they could have
        convicted of manslaughter</i>. It cannot be said that it did not do so by reason
      of the failure to charge them by reference to the objective standard of
      liability with respect to manslaughter. In convicting of murder the jury must
      have found that the appellant had subjective foresight of death. It is
      impossible to hold that they came to this conclusion because they were unable
      to conclude that the appellant had subjective foresight of bodily harm.

    judges error in failing to leave objective foresight of bodily harm as a basis
    upon which Haughton could be found guilty of manslaughter, was harmless in
    light of the jurys verdict of murder. As he explained, it was apparent from
    the verdict that the jury did not reject manslaughter because it was unable to
    conclude that Haughton had subjective foresight of bodily harm.  Rather, by
    its verdict, it was evident that the jury was satisfied that Haughton had
    subjective foresight of death.  Hence, the failure to properly instruct the
    jury on the objective basis by which Haughton could be found guilty of
    manslaughter, while erroneous, was harmless in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span lang=EN-US>Haughton</span></i><span lang=EN-US> is
    important to the issue at hand in two respects. First, it defines the approach
    that must be taken in deciding whether the harmless error branch of the
    curative proviso can be invoked in any given case.  In short, it eschews a
    cookie-cutter approach and calls for a contextual and purposive analysis. 
    Second, in line with that approach, it draws a distinction between cases where
    an included offence is not left with the jury and the jury convicts of a more
    serious offence (not <i>Haughton</i>) and cases where the jury is instructed on
    an included offence but the instruction is tainted by legal error (<i>Haughton</i>). </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The distinction that <i>Haughton </i>draws
    between those two scenarios and the different considerations that apply in
    deciding whether the curative proviso can be invoked is central to the problem
    at hand  can the harmless error branch of the proviso be applied here, where
    the jury did not receive instruction on the offence of attempted murder?  In
    deciding that issue, the focus must be on the concern identified by Sopinka J.
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[A] conviction by the jury of the
    more serious offence  may very well be a reaction against a complete
    acquittal. There is an apprehension that the jury convicted because they had no
    other alternative than acquittal <i>and acquittal was unpalatable.</i> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The notion that a jury might arrive at a verdict
    not because it considers it to be a true verdict based on the evidence but
    because the only other available verdict is one that it finds unpalatable,
    initially strikes me as being at odds with established jurisprudence from the
    Supreme Court in which the court has consistently expressed its faith and trust
    in the jury system and its firm belief that juries can be trusted to perform
    their duties in accordance with the law. See for example, <i>R. v. Corbett</i>,
    [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670 and <i>R. v. Pan; R. v. Sawyer, </i>[2001] 2 S.C.R. 344.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But on closer analysis, I do not read <i>Haughton</i> as suggesting that jurors cannot be trusted to obey the law in difficult cases
    involving hard choices. On the contrary, <i>Haughton</i> takes a practical look
    at how people reason through problems and recognizes that the reasoning process
    can be influenced, consciously or subconsciously, by the end result.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accepting that to be the case and acknowledging
    that the jury in the instant case may have balked at the prospect of letting
    the appellants go free, the fact remains that the jury was not faced with a
    stark choice. Manslaughter was left to the jury as a viable third option 
    and it was viable in every sense of the word.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the choice of manslaughter addressed the <i>Haughton</i> concern. The jury had a palatable option that relieved against the
    unpalatable prospect of letting the appellants go free. Again, strictly from
    the standpoint of <i>Haughton</i>, it can hardly be suggested (and no one does)
    that the jury would have viewed a verdict of manslaughter as a less than
    palatable substitute for a verdict of attempted murder. While there might be
    cases where the third option could itself be viewed as unpalatable,
    particularly when measured against the offence for which the jury did not
    receive an instruction, this is not one. Manslaughter and attempted murder are close
    cousins. They are both serious and they both attract possible life sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the parties and the trial judge accepted
    that intent was a live issue and manslaughter was accordingly left to the jury
    as a viable verdict. No complaint is taken with the trial judges instructions
    on manslaughter, which were both thorough and objective. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, manslaughter was not just a viable
    verdict in theory. It was a viable verdict in fact, depending on the jurys
    view of the evidence.  The appellants take issue with the notion that leaving
    manslaughter with the jury effectively alleviated the <i>Haughton</i> problem.
    In his able argument, Mr.&nbsp;Campbell submitted that in light of the strength
    of the Crowns case on the issue of intent, which he characterized as overwhelming,
    it would have been very difficult for a principled jury to return a verdict of
    manslaughter. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While Mr. Campbells concern may be valid, it
    only holds sway if the evidence is viewed in its most favourable light for the
    Crown, a matter to which I will return shortly. However, I should not be taken
    as accepting that the <i>Haughton</i> problem can never be overcome in cases
    where the more palatable middle-of-the-road verdict may be difficult to justify
    on the facts. To be consistent, once it is accepted that the reasoning process
    may be influenced by the end result  in this case, a jury troubled by the
    prospect of letting the appellants go free  it would be illogical to suggest
    that the same result&#8209;oriented reasoning would not occur with respect to
    conviction  in this case, a jury troubled by the prospect that causation may
    not have been proven, but nonetheless convicting the appellants of the more
    serious crime of murder because manslaughter may not have fit well on the
    facts. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But I need not finally resolve that debate in
    this case. As indicated, Mr.&nbsp;Campbells argument that the Crowns case on
    intent was overwhelming only holds true if the evidence is viewed in its most
    favourable light for the Crown. But that does a major disservice to the approach
    taken by Ms. Mulligan at trial, in which she marshalled the evidence of a
    number of witnesses, accepted by the Crown to be credible and reliable, in an
    effort to show, or at least raise a reasonable doubt, that the shotgun blasts
    that injured Apaid occurred in the midst of a physical struggle between Apaid
    and his brother, Aschley, on the one hand, and their assailants on the other. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Without going into detail, suffice it to say
    that Ms. Mulligan spent the better part of 25 pages of her closing address
    (just 5 short of the number she spent on causation) weaving together a credible
    scenario in which the gun was either produced by Aschley and went off
    accidently in the course of a struggle, or it was produced by one of the
    assailants and went off accidently in a struggle.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That being so, it hardly lies with the
    appellants to suggest at this stage that the scenario presented by Ms. Mulligan
    was fanciful and not worthy of the jurys consideration  or more pointedly,
    that no self-respecting jury could have returned a verdict of manslaughter.</span></p>
  <h2>            <i>(ii)       The Charge to the Jury </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The charge to the jury on causation was anything
    but perfunctory. It was detailed and objective, and it treated the issue of
    causation as a serious matter worthy of the jurys careful attention.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge devoted the better part of 30
    pages of his charge to the issue of causation. He provided the jury with clear
    instructions on the governing legal principles, he reviewed the pertinent
    evidence in considerable detail, and he provided the jury with a succinct
    overview of the parties position. He reminded the jury on several occasions
    that the onus rested on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    shooting of Mr. Noel was a significant contributing cause of the death and
    that if the jury entertained a reasonable doubt on this issue, they must
    acquit.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In short, the trial judges instructions on
    causation were a model of clarity and fairness and there was no attempt on his
    part to influence the jury, subtly or otherwise, to resolve this issue in
    favour of the Crown. The jury was equipped with all of the tools it needed to
    give the matter the careful consideration it deserved.  I have every reason to
    believe that the jury did just that in the course of its extensive
    deliberations, which resulted in the conclusion that the Crown had met its onus
    on the charge of murder. Were it to be assumed that any of the jurors were
    troubled by the issue of causation, but considered it unpalatable to let the
    appellants go free, I would have expected a compromise verdict, <i>i.e</i>.,
    manslaughter, or alternatively, a hung jury. I find it unreasonable, if not
    unfathomable, to think that a jury in those circumstances would render a
    verdict of murder, which would not only have been unresponsive to the concern,
    but a dramatic betrayal of it. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And that, in essence, is where my colleague and
    I part company. At the end of the day, the issue that divides us is the
    integrity of the murder convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I understand my colleague, he takes the
    position that the convictions for murder tell us nothing about whether the jury
    might have reached a different conclusion on causation had the jury been
    instructed on the offence of attempted murder. I, on the other hand, believe
    that the murder convictions tell us all we need to know to conclude that the
    appellants were not prejudiced by the failure to leave the offence of attempted
    murder with the jury and the verdicts would necessarily have been the same had
    the jury been so instructed.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ironically, insofar as the integrity of the verdicts
    is concerned, I believe that the appellants position would be much stronger if
    the jury had convicted them of manslaughter. At least then, they could argue
    that manslaughter was a compromise verdict reached to avoid an unpalatable
    result and that they should rightfully have been convicted of attempted murder
    instead  a hollow victory to be sure, but one which might realistically (or
    more realistically) be put forward as a basis for challenging the integrity of
    the manslaughter verdicts had they been so convicted. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the focus is placed on the integrity of the
    verdicts, as I believe it should be, the case on which my colleague places
    considerable stock, <i>R. v. Davy</i> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), is
    readily understandable and one with which I wholeheartedly agree. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its essence, <i>Davy</i> is a case where the
    integrity of the murder conviction could not be guaranteed because the jury had
    not been instructed on the way or ways by which Davy might be found guilty of
    manslaughter and his co-accused Jackson guilty of murder. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unlike the case at hand, <i>Davy</i> is not a
    case where the palatability of a potential verdict may have played a role in
    the jurys decision. The issue of concern on appeal, both in this court and the
    Supreme Court, was the degree of Davys culpability. Nowhere in his
    instructions did the trial judge expressly tell the jury that it could find
    Jackson guilty of murder and Davy guilty of manslaughter. Indeed, in the
    various scenarios which the trial judge outlined to the jury, none of the possible
    verdicts for Davy was manslaughter. On the contrary, the trial judge stated:
    It may be unlikely in this case that Davy would be guilty of manslaughter.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To repeat, in those circumstances, where the
    offence of manslaughter was not properly left for the jurys consideration
    insofar as Davy was concerned, one could hardly look to the murder conviction
    as a basis for overcoming the error. The error is what put the integrity of
    that verdict in doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But that is not this case. And while my
    colleague is correct to note my focus on <i>Haughton</i>, it is not so much
    because <i>Haughton</i> is the case that I rely on in support of my conclusion
    that the proviso can be applied, as my colleague suggests, but rather that <i>Haughton</i> explains the rationale/practical considerations underlying the principle that a
    new trial will generally be required when an included offence has not been left
    to the jury and the jury is left with a stark choice. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To be clear, in response to my colleagues
    comments at para. 91, I do not for a moment suggest that the court in <i>Haughton</i> intended to implicitly overrule <i>Davy</i>.  Nor do I suggest that <i>Haughton</i> stands for the broad proposition that in every case where an included offence
    is left with the jury and the jury convicts on the main charge, the appellate
    court may take the findings of fact implicit in that verdict into account in
    deciding whether a legal error in the instruction on potential liability for an
    included offence resulted in no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
    Rather, I see the decision in <i>Haughton</i> as supporting the more narrow
    proposition that the fact-finding on the issue of causation implicit in the
    jurys verdict of murder can be relied on in a case like the present one, where
    the jury was properly instructed on the issue of causation and also properly
    instructed on the included offence of manslaughter. As I said at para. 156
    above:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Doubleindent-quote"><span lang=EN-US>Were it to be assumed that any of

  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are
    two other brief matters from my colleagues reasons that I feel obliged to
    address.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, my
    colleague refers on two occasions to the exchanges between the trial judge and
    counsel and the trial judges comment that a failure to leave attempted murder
    would be fatal to any conviction should it turn out that such an instruction
    was required. To the extent that my colleague relies on those exchanges to
    support his conclusion, I would respectfully respond by observing that while
    the views of counsel and the trial judge are certainly worthy of consideration,
    they do not answer the question that we must answer in our appellate role,
    namely, whether the proviso can safely be applied. And if this is a case where
    it can be safely applied, it matters not what the trial judge or trial counsel
    may have thought. (See <i>R. v. Prokofiew</i> (2010), 100 O.R. (3d) 401 at
    para. 41 (Ont. C.A.)).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So too
    with the position taken by the Crown in its factum before us concerning the
    applicability of the proviso i.e., that the case for the Crown on causation was
    overwhelming  a submission that my colleague and I cannot accept. The basis
    upon which I respectfully believe the proviso can and should be applied was put
    to counsel in argument and the matter was fully canvassed. If the proviso was
    available on that basis, then it is up to the court to apply it, irrespective
    of the position taken by the Crown. (See <i>R. v. Pickton</i>, [2010] S.C.C. 32
    per Charron J. at para. 27).</p>
  <h2> CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not pretend that manslaughter was a perfect
    substitute for attempted murder. To be precise, I cannot gainsay the
    possibility that the jury may have looked at the causation issue through a
    slightly different lens had it been instructed on the offence of attempted
    murder. To that extent, this was not a perfect trial. For the reasons stated
    however, I am satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice here and no
    wrong of sufficient import to warrant yet a third trial, assuming the case can still
    be put together, some twelve years after the event.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Identity was the primary issue at both the first
    and second trials. Causation was a secondary issue at the second trial. It took
    shaky hold during Dr. Johnstons cross-examination.  And while Dr. Johnstons
    evidence passed the anything is possible mark, it did so by very little.  No
    defence evidence was called on the subject and the Crown was not permitted to
    call two further experts, including Dr. Michael Pollanen, Chief Pathologist of
    Ontario.  In the end, a carefully instructed, conscientious jury found that the
    Crown had met its burden of proving causation. Taking that into account, along
    with the fact that the jury had  but obviously rejected  the option of
    finding the appellants guilty of manslaughter if outright acquittals were
    considered unpalatable, I am satisfied that the failure to leave attempted
    murder as a possible verdict amounted to harmless error. In short, I am
    satisfied that the verdicts would inevitably have been the same had the jury
    been instructed on the offence of attempted murder.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeals from

    murder, the former being punishable by death and the latter by life
    imprisonment.  The explanatory notes state that the provision was intended to make
    it clear that non-capital murder was an included offence in the obviously more
    serious charge of capital murder: Bill C-92, <i>An Act to amend the Criminal
    Code (Capital Murder)</i>, 4th Sess., 24th Parl., 1960-61, cl. 7.</p>

    there is no such offence.  The offence is attempted murder <i>simpliciter</i>:

    not a possible verdict if there is a reasonable doubt on causation.  The model
    charge instructs the jury to acquit if it has a reasonable doubt on the
    question of causation.</p>

    the criteria set out in s. 662(1).  I need not address that argument.</p>

    H.M. Advocate</i>, 2009 SCCR 518 (Scot. H.C.), the court applied the <i>Coutts</i> analysis but held that the failure to instruct on the included offence of
    attempted murder was a harmless error.  In that case, the accused was charged
    with murder.  Causation was in issue.  The jury was not told about potential
    liability for attempted murder, but was instructed that it could return a
    verdict on certain included assault charges.  The High Court reasoned that any
    doubt on causation would have resulted in a verdict on one of the lesser
    assault-related offences on which the jury was properly instructed, and that
    the failure to instruct on attempted murder did not, therefore, affect the
    validity of the murder conviction.</p>

    under s. 21(2), as well as liability as an aider and abetter: (1992), 11 O.R.
    (2d) 621 (C.A.).  Given the subsequent pronouncement of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Davy</i> with respect to potential liability for manslaughter
    under s. 21(2), it is doubtful that the trial judge in <i>Haughton</i> made any
    error in respect of s. 21(2).  This would leave only the error arising out of
    the aiding and abetting provisions.</p>

    With respect, this is perhaps an area that the Supreme Court of Canada may wish
    to re-visit in view of the present-day complexity of the criminal law, the
    ever-increasing length of criminal trials, the practical difficulties involved
    in re-trying cases many years after the event, the added burden that lengthy
    re-trials place on an already overburdened justice system, the right of victims
    to closure, the interests of finality and the publics overall confidence in
    the administration of justice. Perhaps in light of these modern-day realities,
    a more holistic approach to the application of the proviso would be preferable
    to the existing pigeon-hole model so that the proviso could be applied where
    an appellate court is satisfied that the evidence of guilt is very strong,
    although not quite overwhelming, <i>and</i> the legal error or errors, though
    not insignificant, are highly unlikely to have affected the result.</p>

    v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 499 (S.C.C.)] which may have been viewed
    differently following the Supreme Courts subsequent decision in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 161.</p>

    Following Dr. Johnstons testimony, Crown counsel advised the trial judge that
    he wished to call Dr. Pollanen, Chief Pathologist of Ontario, and Dr. Rodger, a
    haematologist, to confirm that trauma due to gunshots and subsequent surgeries
    were at the origin of the fatal pulmonary embolism, not cocaine ingestion. The
    trial judge denied the Crowns request but stated that he was prepared to
    revisit the matter after hearing from Dr. Markestein. Nothing further came of
    this as Dr. Markestein was not called to testify.</p>
