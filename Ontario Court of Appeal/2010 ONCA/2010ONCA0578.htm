  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 17, 2010, the panel heard two motions in this pending appeal. 
    The first was a motion by the mother, S.J.L., to review and set aside the stay
    of the trial judgment ordered by Epstein J.A.  The second was a motion by the
    child, J.B., for leave to intervene as an added party to the appeal brought by
    his father, S.G.B.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following argument, the parties discussed settlement and asked that we
    not release our decision on the motions while those discussions were ongoing. 
    We agreed to the parties’ request.  We did, however, fix a date for the hearing
    of the appeal in the event the matter was not settled.  That date is Wednesday,
    September 29, 2010.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties, apparently, have been unable to settle this matter.  They
    have therefore asked us to deliver our decision.  What follows is our decision
    on the two motions and our brief reasons.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The mother and father separated in 1998.  They
    have two boys, L.B., who is 19, and J.B., who is 16 and the subject of the
    litigation between the parents.  L.B, the older boy, has lived with the father
    since 2004; J.B. has lived with his father since 2006.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    children and their financial matters for a decade.  The trial that gives rise
    to the appeal before this court took place before Mesbur J. over four days in
    May 2010.  The principal issue at trial was the custody of the younger boy,
    J.B.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The mother sought an order transferring custody
    of J.B. from the father to her.  She claimed that the father had orchestrated a
    deliberate and abusive campaign to alienate the two boys from her.  She
    contended that the father had sought to undermine and destroy her relationship
    with her sons.  She asked that she be allowed to take J.B. for intensive
    therapy at Family Bridges: a Workshop for Troubled and Alienated Parent-Child Relationships. 
    As the trial judge noted, whether the mother ought to be authorized to take
    J.B. to this Workshop informed the entire litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In lengthy and thorough reasons, the trial judge
    accepted the mother’s position.  She affirmed what previous adjudicators had
    found: the father had deliberately and severely alienated the two boys from
    their mother.  The trial judge recognized that L.B. is over the age of
    majority.  But she held that J.B., who has special needs and is in school full time,
    remains a child of the marriage and thus subject to a custody order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s order concerning J.B. is far-reaching. 
    She ordered that custody of J.B. be transferred to the mother and that any
    contact or communication between J.B. and his father (and others) be prohibited
    for three months, after which time she would entertain a motion to terminate or
    vary the non-contact order.  To ensure compliance with this non-contact order,
    she gave the mother discretion to confiscate and prevent J.B.’s use of cell
    phones, pagers, Blackberries, and computers.  Importantly, the trial judge
    ordered that the mother be authorized to obtain any treatment she considered
    necessary for J.B.’s best interests, including participation in the Workshop.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge released her order and reasons
    on June 30, 2010.  The father immediately filed a notice of appeal, and sought
    a stay of the trial judge’s order.  On July 2, Watt J.A. dismissed the father’s
    stay motion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, four days later, J.B., who was not a
    party at trial, brought his own stay motion (through counsel).  On July 7,
    Epstein J.A. granted a stay pending appeal.  The mother now asks us to review
    and set aside this stay.  She argues that it was obtained by lies and fraud,
    and ought not to be permitted to stand.  She undertakes, as a condition of setting
    aside the stay, not to take J.B. to the Workshop pending the disposition of the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not think it is necessary to discuss in
    any detail the arguments for and against setting aside the stay.  In our view,
    the balance of convenience favours maintaining the stay until the appeal is
    heard.  In practical terms a “stay” or the status quo has been in effect for
    two months.  The time between now and the hearing of the appeal is short.  The
    order under appeal, as we have said, is far-reaching.  The mother’s
    undertaking, though well-intentioned, does not advance her position because, as
    the trial judge said, this case is about trying to repair the relationship
    between mother and son, and the Workshop may be the only hope for doing so. 
    Transferring custody of J.B. to the mother while denying access to the Workshop
    or other intensive therapy may not be in J.B.’s best interests.  On the other
    hand, we recognize that, on the trial judge’s findings, permitting the father’s
    continued custody of J.B. is also not in the child’s best interests.  Still,
    considering that the appeal is but three weeks away, we think the prudent
    course is to dismiss the motion for review.  The stay ordered by Epstein J.A.
    will remain in effect pending the hearing of the appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>J.B. seeks leave to intervene as an added party
    on the appeal.  The mother opposes the motion.  A motion of this kind is highly
    unusual in a custody dispute.  Typically, if the child is to be heard, an
    application would be made for the appointment of the Children’s Lawyer to
    represent the child.  That was not done here, and we can only presume that the
    reason was tactical.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A motion for leave to intervene as an added
    party is governed by r. 13.01(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>A person who is not a party to a proceeding may move for leave to
    intervene as an added party if the person claims,</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Double-indent-subquote"><span
lang=EN-US>(a)</span><span lang=EN-US>       an interest in the subject matter
        of the proceeding;</span></p>
      <p class="Double-indent-subquote"><span
lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span lang=EN-US>       that the person may be adversely
        affected by a judgment in the proceeding; or</span></p>
      <p class="Double-indent-subquote"><span
lang=EN-US>(c)</span><span lang=EN-US>       that there exists between the
        person and one or more of the parties to the proceeding a question of law or
        fact in common with one or more of the questions in issue in the proceeding.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.B. satisfies all three elements of r. 13.01(1), any one of which would
    be sufficient.  He obviously has an interest in the subject matter of the
    proceeding: his custody.  He may be adversely affected by the judgment of the
    trial judge or of this court in the sense that he may object to the terms of
    his custody and may not obey one or more of those terms.  Finally, the
    questions of fact and law in the proceeding are common to his parents and to
    him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, even if one or more of the elements of r. 13.01(1) is made out,
    the court still has discretion to refuse to make the intervention order. 
    Ordinarily, in a custody case we would think an order permitting a child who is
    the subject of the dispute to be added as a party would rarely be made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But this is not an ordinary case.  In our view, granting the intervention
    motion is justified for two reasons.  First, J.B. is now 16 years of age.  Even
    accepting the expert evidence at trial that he has the emotional maturity of a
    13 year-old, he is an intelligent young man and has reached the age where his
    voice is entitled to be heard by this court.  Moreover, the trial judge’s order
    has the potential to dramatically change J.B.’s life.  In the light of that
    potential, he ought to be able to participate in the proceeding that will
    determine with whom and under what terms he lives, independently of either the
    alienating or alienated parent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge’s order raises important and difficult issues. 
    We think it would benefit the panel to hear J.B.’s perspective on these issues
    through the submissions of his own counsel.  We therefore grant the motion to
    intervene, but on terms, which we discuss below. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(5)<span

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rule 13.01(2) permits the court to order terms
    that will prevent the intervention from unduly delaying the rights of the
    parties to the appeal.  Terms are appropriate here because this appeal ought to
    be heard and resolved as soon as possible.  Therefore, to ensure that the
    hearing of the appeal is not delayed, our order granting leave to J.B. to
    intervene as an added party shall be on the following two terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)
           J.B. must accept the trial record as it stands.  He shall not be
    permitted to seek to file fresh evidence on the appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)
          J.B. shall not be permitted to advance the constitutional arguments
    raised at paras. 43 to 45 of his factum on the motions.  These issues were not
    raised at trial. Moreover, as this is private litigation not engaging a state
    actor, these issues seem to us on a preliminary assessment to have little or no
    merit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
