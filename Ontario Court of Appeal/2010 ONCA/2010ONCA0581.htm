  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for the first degree murder of Lisa
    Posluns, who was brutally murdered on November 2, 2002 in a building in
    Yorkville where she had an office. Four months later, the appellant, who had
    previously worked as a janitor at the building, was charged with her murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issue at trial was the identity of the killer. On this issue,
    the DNA evidence was overwhelming. It took two forms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the semen found on Ms. Poslun’s jeans could not be excluded as
    having come from the appellant, and the probability of it coming from someone
    else was 1 in 670 billion. In addition, the saliva found on Ms. Poslun’s
    underwear could not be excluded as coming from the appellant, and the
    probability of it coming from someone else was 1 in 65,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, when he was arrested, the appellant was in possession of a
    knife, knife sheath and handcuffs. DNA profiles were generated from the knife
    sheath and handcuffs. They matched with Ms. Posluns, with there being virtually
    no chance of it being anyone else.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The DNA evidence forms the first ground of appeal. The genesis of this
    evidence was the appellant’s DNA which was on file at the Centre of Forensic
    Sciences as a result of a police investigation of three charges of sexual
    assault, one of which resulted in the appellant’s conviction for sexual assault
    with a weapon in 1995. The appellant does not dispute that the DNA sample was
    seized as incident to a lawful arrest. At trial, the trial judge made a ruling
    that the police use of the 1995 DNA evidence, obtained from the appellant’s
    underwear, did not violate his <i>Charter</i> s. 8 rights to be secure against
    unreasonable search and seizure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial judge’s ruling. Once the appellant was convicted
    of sexual assault with a weapon (indeed he pleaded guilty) his privacy with
    respect to identifying information was significantly diminished. As Charron J.
    said in <i>R. v. Jackpine</i> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.), at para.
    43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The appellant’s] identity as a multiple sex
    offender has become a matter of state interest and he has lost any reasonable
    expectation of privacy in the <i>identifying information</i> derived from DNA
    sampling in the same way as he has lost any expectation of privacy in his
    fingerprints, photograph or any other identifying measure taken under the
    authority of the <i>Identification of Criminals Act</i>. [Emphasis in
    original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A similar point was made by Feldman J.A. of this court, with respect to
    fingerprint evidence obtained in relation to a previous offence, in <i>R. v. Dore </i>(2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at para. 50:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Once fingerprints have been taken from an
    individual, it is only the informational component of the fingerprint about
    which a person can retain any expectation of privacy. When a person continues
    to be subject to the charge for which the person was arrested, or has been
    convicted of the charge, then the original basis for obtaining the information
    disclosed by fingerprints set out by La Forest J. in <i>Beare and Higgins</i> continues and therefore justifies the retention and use of that information on
    an ongoing basis for law enforcement purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the previous information was obtained, via the
    common law, as an incident to lawful arrest whereas in <i>Dore</i> it was
    obtained via a statute. We can see no significance in this difference; in both
    contexts the information has been lawfully obtained and retained by the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, at a policy level, we agree with what Ewaschuk J. said in his
    ruling, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where the accused’s DNA is lawfully obtained, I
    find no policy justification in foreclosing the right of the police to use the
    accused’s DNA for comparison purposes in subsequent unrelated investigations,
    particularly where the offence in respect of which the DNA was lawfully seized
    resulted in a conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, we would not give effect to the first ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s second ground of appeal relates to the trial judge’s
    charge to the jury on the issue of reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge charged the jury that reasonable doubt only applies to
    the essential matters so that individual items of evidence, including the DNA
    findings, need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As non-essential facts,
    he invited them to find these on a balance of probabilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on <i>R. v. Quidley</i> (2008) 232 C.C.C. (3d) 255 (Ont. C.A.),
    the appellant argues that, given the prominence of the DNA evidence in proof of
    identity, the instruction effectively relieved the prosecution of proving the
    appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, <i>Quidley</i> is distinguishable. In that case this court
    found reversible error where the trial judge instructed the jury that the
    evidence of voice identification and translation accuracy need be proved on a
    balance of probabilities. The trial judge did not tell the jury that they must
    consider that evidence, together with all of the other evidence, in determining
    whether the evidence raised a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt. This
    court found a very serious likelihood that the jury would be confused and would
    misapprehend the correct standard of proof. However, on that record, the
    evidence was effectively the only evidence of identity and the court considered
    it to be almost the same as essential elements. In this case, on the other
    hand, there was a significant body of evidence relevant to the issue of
    identity, quite apart from the DNA evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge quite properly explained that proof to a
    certainty was not required; he was entitled to comment upon the evidence; and
    he properly advised the jury to consider all the evidence cumulatively to
    determine whether the case was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, taking the charge as a whole, the jury would not have
    misapprehended the correct standard of proof or convicted the accused on a
    lower standard. The trial judge made very clear that the identity of the
    murderer was an essential matter that the Crown had to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt. We do not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
