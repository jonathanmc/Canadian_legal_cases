  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial before Fragomeni J., the appellant was convicted of
    possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, possession of a firearm without a
    licence, possession of counterfeit money, possession of stolen property having
    a value exceeding $5000 (stolen paint), and two counts of possession of stolen
    property having a value not exceeding $5000 (stolen mops, stolen Christmas
    trees). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police seized the items forming the subject matter of the charges while
    executing a search warrant authorizing a search of the appellant’s home. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issues at trial were: i) the validity of the search warrant,
    and ii) if the search warrant was invalid, the admissibility under s. 24(2) of
    the <i>Charter</i> of evidence of the items seized when the search warrant was
    executed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ruled that the search warrant was invalid and that the
    warrantless search of the appellant’s home was a breach of the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. However,
    after applying the framework from <i>R. v. Collins, </i>[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, for
    assessing whether evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the trial judge declined to exclude the evidence of the items seized. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequent to the trial judge’s ruling, the Supreme Court of Canada
    released its decision in <i>R. v. Grant</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, modifying the <i>Collins</i> analytical framework for exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) of
    the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in failing to
    exclude the evidence of the items seized during the execution of the search
    warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>

    search the appellant's residence at 12 Huntspoint Drive, Brampton based on an

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span

    trailer load of Behr base paint. However, because of concerns about the
    identity of the confidential informant, for the purposes of the appellant’s
    application to quash the search warrant, Crown counsel at trial redacted, as he
    was required to do, significant portions of the information provided by the

    written on its side parked in the driveway of 18 Huntspoint Road, Brampton,
    which was the residence of Sukhninder Dhillon and Balwant Dhillon. The red van moved
    from the driveway at 18 Huntspoint Road to the driveway at 12 Huntspoint Road,
    Brampton, and the driver of the van entered the home at 12 Huntspoint Road without
    knocking. A motor vehicle office search revealed that the appellant owned the
    red van. A Land Registry Office search revealed that the appellant owned the
    home at 12 Huntspoint Road, Brampton.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Detective Constable Jackson, the surveillance evidence
    indicated that on October 22, 2007, Sukhninder Dhillon travelled from his home
    at 18 Huntspoint Road, Brampton to a commercial plaza in Brampton in a white
    cube van. At the plaza, Sukhninder Dhillon turned the van over to two unknown
    males who went to a residence at 16 Borneo Cr., Brampton, where they unloaded a
    large number of 3.86 litre cans of paint from the rear of the cube van into the
    garage of the residence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two unknown males then picked up Sukhninder Dhillon in the white
    cube van at another commercial plaza and the “van then briefly returned to [the
    appellant’s home at] 12 Huntspoint Road before then returning once again to 16
    Borneo Cr. in Brampton”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, on October 24, 2007, police followed Sukhninder Dhillon to 2
    Cadetta Road,       Brampton, where the tractor trailer had been recovered. He
    was later observed travelling in and out of commercial parking lots housing
    unattended tractor trailers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, on October 25, 2007, “surveillance officers discovered the
    garage door [at the appellant’s home at 12 Huntspoint Road, Brampton] wide open
    and were able to observe a large number of both 4 Litre and 5 gallon containers
    of paint stacked in the garage.” Surveillance officers later followed
    Sukhninder Dhillon to an address immediately beside 200 Advance Blvd., Brampton,
    where the original tractor-trailer theft occurred. After a short time,
    Sukhninder Dhillon was picked up by another vehicle, which was then followed “going
    into numerous trucking yards housing unattended tractor trailers.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the conclusion section of the Information to Obtain, Detective Constable
    Jackson expressed the view that the surveillance evidence linked the appellant
    to the stolen paint. He said he “firmly believe[d]” that Sukhninder Dhillon,
    Balwant Dhillon and the appellant were in possession of stolen paint and that
    it was stored at the appellant’s residence. In addition, he said,
    “[o]bservations have established that Sukhninder DHILLON accesses this paint
    from the residence at 12 Huntspoint Road in Brampton and delivers it to buyers
    as evidenced when a quantity was taken from the garage at 12 Huntspoint Road
    and delivered to 16 Borneo Cr in Brampton.”</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police obtained the search warrant and executed it on November 15,
    2007. Although the warrant authorized police to search for containers of stolen
    paint, for related bills of lading and shipping documents and for four black 9
    mm handguns and ammunition, the only offence alleged in the search warrant was
    possession of stolen paint.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police seized the following items during the search of the appellant's
    home:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Green and black bags containing approximately $371,670 of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a grey plastic bag containing a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>cargo from four separate tractor-trailers thefts in Brampton and

    Christmas trees and mops.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The items seized were found in many locations throughout the appellant's
    home including: the garage, the basement, the family room, the laundry room and
    four bedrooms.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            iii)       The Evidence led by the Appellant
    on his <i>Charter</i> Applications</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his <i>Charter</i> applications to quash the search
    warrant and to exclude the evidence obtained when the search warrant was
    executed, the appellant relied on the redacted Information to Obtain,
    transcripts of the preliminary inquiry and the oral evidence of Detective
    Constable Jackson led on the <i>voir dire</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both at the preliminary inquiry and on the <i>voir dire</i>, Detective
    Constable Jackson acknowledged that his statement in the Information to Obtain
    to the effect that surveillance officers observed “a large number of both 4 Litre
    and 5 gallon containers of paint stacked in the garage” of the appellant's
    residence located at 12 Huntspoint Road, Brampton, contained errors. Detective
    Constable Jackson relied on e-mail summaries of the surveillance officers’
    observations to prepare the Information to Obtain. He acknowledged that the
    e-mail summaries did not include references to either “a large number of”
    containers of paint or to “4 litre” containers of paint being in the garage. At
    the preliminary inquiry, he agreed that the e-mail summaries did not refer to
    any quantity of five gallon containers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Constable Jackson testified that the erroneous references were
    “mistakes” on his part, and that he had no intention of misleading the Justice
    of the Peace who issued the warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant initially suggested during the <i>voir dire</i> that he would be relying on a Special Services Report (a typed summary of the
    surveillance officers’ observations) to amplify the record before the reviewing
    judge, he abandoned this request when the trial Crown suggested that the
    reviewing judge would have to consider the whole of the Special Services Report
    to put any inaccuracies revealed by that report into their proper context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the e-mail summaries of the surveillance officers’ observations
    that Detective Constable Jackson used to prepare the search warrant and the
    Special Services Report indicated that Sukhninder Dhillon was present in the
    white cube van at the appellant's residence at 12 Huntspoint Road, Brampton, on
    October 22, 2007 before travelling to his home at 18 Huntspoint Road, Brampton
    and then to the commercial plaza where he turned the white cube van over to two
    unknown males. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, although this source material was before the trial judge, and although
    the trial Crown initially relied on the source material in his submissions,
    ultimately, the appellant did not rely on the source material to amplify the record
    before the trial judge. Further, the trial Crown acknowledged that if the
    appellant was not relying on the source material, he was not entitled to do so
    either, because doing so would amount to “do[ing] an end run around the prior
    judicial authorization requirement”.</p>

    informant relating to the four handguns was not detailed and that the detail that
    was provided was not compelling. In this regard, he said, “information about
    where someone resides, and what type of car they drive … is not compelling.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge noted that there was no indication of when the
    handguns were observed, of the source of the confidential informant's information
    or of the basis of the confidential informant’s belief that the handguns were
    still in the appellant’s home. In addition, there was “insufficient information
    about the reliability of the confidential informant, and the basis for any
    reliability.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in the light of the three weeks that elapsed between the date
    on which the police obtained the confidential informant’s information and the
    date on which they obtained the search warrant, the trial judge said, “it is
    difficult to accept the officer’s conclusion that the items … would be located
    in the premises.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span

    In particular, Detective Constable Jackson’s erroneous references to “a large
    number” of paint containers and to “4 litre” paint containers could both have
    been important for the purposes of tying the paint observed in the appellant's

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span

    warrant was obtained. In the end, the trial judge concluded that the search
    warrant had to be quashed and that the appellant had established a breach of
    his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.</p>

    noted that the evidence was essential to the Crown's case and that it was
    “reliable and real” evidence with “high” probative value. He concluded, “[t]he
    exclusion of a loaded gun and ammunition, $371,670 in Canadian counterfeit
    currency, and a significant amount of stolen paint would ... bring the

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Grant</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada modified the <i>Collins</i> analytical framework for the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When faced with an application for exclusion under
    s. 24(2), a court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence
    on society's confidence in the justice system having regard to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i>-infringing
    state conduct (admission may send a message the justice system condones serious
    state misconduct),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) the impact of the breach on the <i>Charter</i>-protected
    interests of the accused (admission may send the message that individual rights
    count for little), and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) society's interest in the adjudication of the
    case on its merits.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court's role on a s. 24(2) application is to
    balance the assessment under each of these lines of inquiry to determine
    whether, considering all of the circumstances, admission of the evidence would
    bring the administration of justice into disrepute. These concerns, while not
    precisely tracking the categories of considerations set out in <i>Collins</i>,
    capture the factors relevant to the s. 24(2) determination as enunciated in <i>Collins</i> and subsequent jurisprudence: <i>Grant</i> at para. 71.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Grant</i> was delivered
    subsequent to the trial judge's ruling, the appellant is entitled to rely on
    the <i>Grant</i> framework on appeal: see <i>R. v. Blake</i> 2010 ONCA 1 at
    para. 2. As was the case in <i>Blake</i>, the decision in <i>Grant</i> was
    under reserve when the trial judge in this case made his ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the <i>Grant</i> framework, the appellant contends that
    the trial judge erred in his s. 24(2) analysis by under-emphasizing the
    seriousness of the police conduct, by failing to consider the impact of the
    breach on the <i>Charter</i>-protected interests of the appellant and by
    overemphasizing the seriousness of the offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of this case, I would accept the appellant's submissions.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            1.) The Seriousness of the Breach</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Grant</i>, the majority explained at para. 72 that the first line
    of inquiry under the s. 24(2) analysis “requires a court to assess whether the
    admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute by sending a message to the public that the courts ... effectively
    condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate
    themselves from the fruits of that the unlawful conduct.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority went on to explain that on a s. 24(2) application, the
    court “must consider the seriousness of the violation, viewed in terms of the
    gravity of the offending conduct by state authorities whom the rule of law
    requires to uphold the rights guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i>”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>State conduct resulting in <i>Charter</i> violations
    varies in seriousness. At one end of the spectrum, admission of evidence
    obtained through inadvertent or minor violations of the <i>Charter</i> may
    minimally undermine public confidence in the rule of law. At the other end of
    the spectrum, admitting evidence obtained through a wilful or reckless
    disregard of <i>Charter</i> rights will inevitably have a negative effect on
    the public confidence in the rule of law, and risk bringing the administration
    of justice into disrepute: <i>Grant</i> at paras. 73-74.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge accepted Detective Constable Jackson's evidence
    that he did not intend to mislead the issuing Justice of the Peace, the trial
    judge concluded that the officer's carelessness had that effect. Absent the
    officer’s misleading statements, the Information to Obtain failed to establish
    a sufficient link between the appellant and the stolen paint to support the
    issuance of a search warrant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At least in its factum, the Crown argued that the trial judge erred in
    failing to find that the search warrant could have been issued. I disagree. The
    fact that surveillance officers saw the appellant’s truck in Sukhninder
    Dhillon’s driveway on one occasion, that they observed the white cube van at
    the appellant's residence briefly on another occasion and that they saw an
    unknown quantity of five gallon paint containers in the appellant's garage did not establish a sufficient link between the appellant and the stolen paint
    to support the issuance of a warrant to search the appellant's home. These
    observations did not support the conclusions Detective Constable Jackson
    expressed in the search warrant. The redacted Information to Obtain disclosed
  no other basis for issuing the search warrant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for declining to exclude the evidence of the seized
    items, the trial judge appeared to diminish the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breach, at least to some extent, by emphasizing that the affiant officer's
    conduct was not flagrant, deliberate or egregious. However, while perhaps not
    flagrant, deliberate or egregious, the affiant officer’s erroneous statement
    that surveillance officers observed a large quantity of paint containers in the
    appellant's garage lacked any reasonable explanation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The affiant officer attributed his mistakes to the fact that he was
    rushing to complete the paperwork for the search warrant. His reference in the
    Information to Obtain to surveillance officers observing four litre containers
    of paint in the appellant's garage might reasonably have been the result of
    rushing, oversight and confusion. However, lack of time is hardly an excuse for
    inserting an important detail about quantity that had the effect of linking the
    appellant to the stolen paint when that detail did not form any part of the
    source material on which the officer was relying. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, the level of police carelessness can only be
    characterized as significant. Although not at the extreme end of the spectrum
    of state misconduct, significant carelessness on the part of the police that
    leads to the issuance of an invalid search warrant must nonetheless be placed
    on the serious side of that spectrum. </p>

      Interests of the Accused</span></h4>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the second <i>Grant</i> factor, the trial judge failed to consider
    at all the impact of the breach on the <i>Charter</i>-protected interests of
    the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the <i>Collins</i> framework, the impact of a breach was a matter
    that was often considered when assessing the seriousness of the
    state-infringing conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, in this case, in addressing the seriousness of the
    breach, the trial judge described the police conduct as “relat[ing] to a flawed
    ITO.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the fact that the police made efforts comply with the <i>Charter</i> by applying for a search warrant was no doubt a relevant factor in assessing
    the seriousness of the breach, the trial judge erred by failing to turn his
    mind to the important fact that the invalid warrant authorized a search of a dwelling
    house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that a dwelling house attracts a high expectation
    of privacy and that an illegal search of a person's home constitutes a
    significant breach of the person's right to be free from unreasonable search
    and seizure: <i>R. v. Silveira</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 450 (S.C.C.) at para.
    148.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, at para. 78 of <i>Grant</i>, the majority stated, “[a]n
    unreasonable search that intrudes on an area in which the individual reasonably
    enjoys a high expectation of privacy... is more serious than one that does not”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the intrusive illegal search of the appellant's home is a
    factor that points strongly to exclusion of the evidence of the seized items.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            3.) Society's Interest in the Adjudication of
    the Case on its Merits</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the third <i>Grant</i> factor, the trial judge concluded that
    the combination of the seriousness of the charges, the reliability and
    significant probative value of the seized items and their centrality in proving
    the Crown's case militated in favour of admitting the evidence of the seized
    items. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, at para. 84 of <i>Grant</i>, the majority expressed the view
    that the seriousness of the charge(s) is a matter has the potential to cut both
    ways and thus downplayed the importance of the seriousness of the offence as a
    relevant factor in the s. 24(2) analysis:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, while the seriousness of the alleged
    offence may be a valid consideration, it has the potential to cut both ways.
    Failure to effectively prosecute a serious charge due to excluded evidence may
    have an immediate impact on how people view the justice system. Yet, as
    discussed, it is the long-term repute of the justice system that is s. 24(2)’s
    focus ... The short-term public clamour for a conviction in a particular case
    must not deafen the s. 24(2) judge to the longer-term repute of the
    administration of justice. Moreover, while the public has a heightened interest
    in seeing a determination on the merits where the offence charged is serious,
    it also has a vital interest in having a justice system that is above reproach,
    particularly were the penal stakes for the accused are high. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the police were able to obtain a warrant to conduct an
    intrusive search of the appellant’s home solely because of significant carelessness
    in preparing the Information to Obtain. This is conduct from which the court
    should be concerned about dissociating itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I agree that the reliability and high probative value of the
    seized items and their centrality to the prosecution’s case are important
    factors pointing to admissibility, in my opinion, they do not outweigh the significant
    harm to the long-term repute of the administration of justice that would be
    occasioned by the admission of the evidence of the items seized in executing
    the search warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in my opinion, the Crown is not entitled to rely on the fact
    that additional information contained in the source material might have
    supported the issuance of the warrant had Detective Constable Jackson made
    reference to it to attempt to attenuate the seriousness of the breach for the
    purpose of the s. 24(2) analysis. Crown counsel at trial agreed that if the
    appellant did not amplify the record on his application to quash the search
    warrant by making reference to the source material, the Crown was not entitled
    to do so, because permitting the Crown to do so would circumvent the judicial
    authorization process. I see no basis for holding that the Crown was entitled
    to amplify the record for the purposes of the s. 24(2) application. In any
    event, the trial Crown did not apply to amplify the record for the purposes of
    the s. 24(2) application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Crown argued that this was a gun case, not a paint case;
    and that if the Information to Obtain fell short in terms of justifying a
    warrant to search for guns, it did not fall short by much. In particular, the
    Crown claimed that the general reliability of the confidential informant was
    demonstrated by the accuracy of the information provided by the confidential
    informant linking Sukhninder Dhillon to the tractor trailer theft. In assessing
    whether the search warrant could have been issued, the trial judge failed to
    take account of this factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even accepting that the trial judge erred in the manner alleged, I would
    not accept this argument. Contrary to the Crown’s argument, the Information to
    Obtain was not targeted at firearms offences. Detective Constable Jackson said
    he believed a search would reveal evidence of the offence of possession of
    stolen property – he did not say he believed a search would reveal evidence of
    a firearms offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, as the trial judge noted, the Information to Obtain
    provided no particulars concerning the source of the confidential informant’s
    belief that there were guns in the appellant’s house; no particulars concerning
    when the guns were observed; and no particulars concerning the basis for the
    confidential informant’s belief that the guns were still in the house.
    Moreover, there was a three week gap between the date on which the confidential
    informant provided information about the guns to the police and the date on
    which the police applied for the search warrant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a case like <i>R. v. Hines,</i> 2009 ONCA 703, in which this
    court said at para 2, “[a]ssuming, however, that the information to obtain the
    warrant was deficient, it missed the mark by very little.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the evidence of the seized items should have been

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal. As the Crown
    adduced no evidence at trial other than the evidence led on the <i>voir dire</i> and applied on the trial, I would set aside the convictions and substitute
    acquittals. </p>
