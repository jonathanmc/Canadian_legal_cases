  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Michael Bissonnette was convicted of
    robbery. The respondent Cory Michaud was convicted of robbery and assaulting a
    peace officer. The robbery took place after the respondents chased a 15-year old
    boy down a public street, cornered him in a back yard of a residential home,
    choked and punched him, and stole his cell phone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An individual who witnessed the robbery from an
    adjacent home followed the respondents and, with the assistance of two others,
    caught and held the respondents until the police arrived. During the arrest,
    Cory Michaud began swinging his arms in an attempt to break free and attempted
    to head butt the arresting officer. Although the head butt missed hitting the
    officer, he nevertheless suffered a broken hand while effecting the arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the sentence hearing, the Crown submission was that
    custodial sentences of nine and 12 months for Bissonnette and Michaud
    respectively should be imposed. Both men had criminal records, including
    previous convictions for break and enter, though the records themselves were
    fairly dated. They also had previous convictions for failure to abide by court
    orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Bissonnette suggested a 9-12 month
    conditional sentence and counsel for Michaud asked for a 12 month conditional
    sentence. In his submission, Bissonette’s counsel specifically referred to
    house arrest as a term of a conditional sentence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Your Honour, if you are prepared to consider a
    conditional sentence, what I would ask you to consider in addition to the
    proposed terms that are set out at page eight of the report. Obviously, all of
    the statutory terms that there be <i>a
    provision for house arrest</i> and that the exceptions to that would be for
    employment, medical emergencies, and I’d ask you to consider one four hour
    period per week to attend the necessities of life.... [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Michaud did not explicitly refer to house
    arrest in his submission. However, he did say that a conditional sentence “has
    teeth”, is “a jail sentence, albeit in the community” that “is going to have a
    deterrent value”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed conditional sentences of nine
    and 12 months on Bissonnette and Michaud respectively. He did not impose as a
    term of the sentences any form of house arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the trial judge had finished delivering his
    reasons for sentence, Crown counsel raised the absence of a house arrest term:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Your Honour, I’m not sure if I heard a house arrest
    component and whether or not there should be an exception, obviously, given the
    nature of the conditional sentence, I have no opposition to some exception
    period, but there should be one and I would ask the door-knock provision also
    apply, obviously if there is going to be a house arrest component.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge responded in this fashion: “I’ve also
    considered the request by counsel relating to house arrest and it’s not a
    condition that I’ll make in this particular situation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals the sentences on the basis that the
    trial judge erred by not including a house arrest component in the conditional
    sentences he imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant’s position. In the leading
    case on conditional sentences, <i>R. v.
    Proulx</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 61 at paras. 36 and 103 Lamer C.J.C. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, conditional sentences should generally
    include punitive conditions that are restrictive of the offender’s liberty.
    Conditions such as house arrest or strict curfews should be the norm, not the
    exception.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, the conditions should have a punitive
    aspect. Indeed, the need for punitive conditions is the reason why a
    probationary sentence was rejected and a sentence of imprisonment of less than
    two years imposed. As stated above, conditions such as house arrest should be
    the norm, not the exception. This means that the offender should be confined to
    his or her home except when working, attending school, or fulfilling other
    conditions of his or her sentence, e.g. community service, meeting with the
    supervisor, or participating in treatment programs. Of course, there will need
    to be exceptions for medical emergencies, religious observance, and the like.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>See also: <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1999] O. J. No. 2694 at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge offered no reason for departing from
    the norm prescribed in <i>Proulx</i>. Nor
    can we see such a reason. Both respondents were convicted of a serious offence—robbery.
    Michaud was also convicted of assaulting a police officer. Both respondents had
    previous criminal records. The person they robbed was a vulnerable 15-year old
    boy who was chased, cornered and attacked by two grown men. A victim impact
    statement revealed that since the incident the boy has stayed home a lot, does
    not go out after dark, even with friends, and “constantly looked over my shoulder
    feeling nervous all the time and trusting no one.” A police officer suffered a
    broken hand while trying to take control of Michaud. Finally, apart from the
    standard statutory conditions, the only restriction imposed by the trial judge
    on the respondents’ liberty was an order to stay 100 metres away from the
    victim and two other individuals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken together, these facts establish that, even
    against the backdrop of the substantial deference that is owed to a sentencing
    judge, the sentences imposed on the respondents were unfit. There should have
    been a house arrest or strict curfew component in the conditional sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The appellant seeks
    an extension of the sentences and the imposition of a strict curfew for the
    remainder of the sentences. We are not inclined to increase the sentences
    because both respondents have served most of their sentences and, the Crown
    informs us, have done so successfully. We would order that for the remainder of
    their sentences, the respondent Bissonnette live at 611 11<sup>th</sup> Street
    East, Cornwall and the respondent Michaud live at 650 Hamilton Crescent,
    Cornwall. In addition, both respondents must remain in their residences between
    8 p.m. and 6 a.m. except for medical emergencies, employment, and otherwise
    with the written permission of the conditional sentence supervisor.</p>
