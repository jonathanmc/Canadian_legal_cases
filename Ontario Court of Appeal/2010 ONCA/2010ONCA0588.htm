  <p><b>Juriansz J.A.:</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a Crown appeal from a trial before a judge of
    the Superior Court of Justice sitting without a jury.  The respondent was charged with weapons
    offences, alleging he possessed a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition, and that he
    did so while under a weapons prohibition and while on probation with conditions
    not to possess weapons.  The police found
    the shotgun and ammunition in the respondent’s room in a rooming house during
    the execution of a search warrant in the course of a murder investigation.  Another resident of the rooming house was charged
    with and has been convicted of the murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial essentially consisted of an application
    brought by the respondent on the basis that his right to be secure from
    unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 8 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> was infringed.  The application was heard and the evidence
    was excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter.  </i>Upon that ruling the Crown called no
    evidence and the respondent was found not guilty of all charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would find that the
    trial judge misapprehended parts of the evidence, and failed to properly
    consider some of the evidence.  On a
    proper review of all the evidence, I would allow the appeal and set aside the acquittals
    and order a new trial.  In my view, there
    were sufficient grounds upon which the issuing justice of the peace could have
    granted the search warrant.  Consequently
    the search and seizure were constitutional and the shotgun and ammunition were
    admissible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Submissions were made at the trial and on appeal about
    the expectation of privacy that a person has in a rooming house.  In my view, nothing in this appeal turns on
    the degree of the respondent’s expectation of privacy.  The evidence seized was found in the
    exclusive space of the respondent within a rooming house, and his expectation
    of privacy there from state intrusion was as high as that of a resident of a
    single dwelling unit.  There is also
    nothing that turns, in my view, on the fact that a single warrant was sought
    with respect to the entire rooming house with more than one tenant.  The places for which search warrants are
    sought are often complex and frequently involve more than one person’s
    interests.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 14, 2006, the body of a female was discovered
    on the grounds of a townhouse complex located on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    John Garland Boulevard in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  It was later determined that the cause of
    death was multiple stab wounds to the neck, and scissors were found implanted
    in her upper body.  The deceased was
    clothed from the waist up and her legs were bound by a section of telephone
    cord.  The body was found inside a large
    black garbage bag, inside a large black bag, described variously as a gym,
    hockey, duffel or sports bag.  This bag
    was first noticed on the grounds of the complex by residents four days earlier,
    on July 10. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two other garbage bags were also found with the large
    black sports bag.  In the other two
    garbage bags were found a number of significant items, including:</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police conducted searches of their computer
    databases in relation to the address
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    246
    John Garland Boulevard #77, which is one of the
    townhouses in the complex where the body was found.  Among the information retrieved was a
    reference to an outstanding set of charges against William <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell,
    which included three charges of aggravated sexual assault, assault causing
    bodily harm, assault with a weapon, assault, and threatening death.  The police also obtained a synopsis of the
    allegations relating to these outstanding charges.  The police information also listed William <span
class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell as residing at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    246 John Garland Boulevard #77
    (“townhouse #77”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Out of concern for any other occupants who may have
    been in danger or in need of any medical attention the police decided to enter
    townhouse #77.  The Emergency Task Force
    entered the townhouse and extracted three people, <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell,
    the respondent and the respondent’s girlfriend.  Once the ETF cleared the building, it was sealed and guarded by the
    police, who prevented anyone from entering.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police tentatively confirmed the identity of the
    deceased with her family using a description of distinctive tattoos which were
    found on the body, and later definitively with dental records.  It was also confirmed by the police that the
    deceased was last seen at work on July 8 and that she failed to return for her
    shift on July 9<span style='font-family:"Times New (W1)","serif";"Times New Roman"'>, just prior to the sports bag</span> first being noticed by
    residents of the townhouse complex on July 10.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police interviewed <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell,
    the respondent, and his girlfriend, as well as the owner/landlord of townhouse
    #77.  It was then confirmed that the
    deceased, <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell, the respondent and one
    Gregory Ryder were all residents of townhouse #77 which was a rooming house.  Ryder was also interviewed by the police
    shortly thereafter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From these interviews police learned more specifics
    about the living arrangements within the townhouse.  The landlord in particular indicated that the
    four individuals were renting furnished rooms and each tenant had a lock on his
    or her door.  He indicated that there is
    a shared bathroom on the second floor and a shared kitchen on the main floor.
    This appears to have been an oversimplification, because in fact there is also a
    living room and a dining room on the first floor and a kitchen and a bathroom
    in the basement. The landlord indicated that the deceased, <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell,
    and Ryder had their rooms on the second floor, and the respondent had a room in
    the basement.  The respondent had to go
    through the first floor to get to his room in the basement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent indicated to the police that he had
    moved into townhouse #77 in mid-June, only a few weeks prior to the deceased’s
    disappearance.  During his interview with
    the police, <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell indicated that the respondent
    used black bags and luggage when he moved into the townhouse – that he had two
    or three bags that were all black.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police applied for a warrant to search townhouse
    #77, and as required by s.&nbsp;487 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, one of the investigating officers swore <span class=GramE>an
    Information</span> to Obtain Search Warrant (ITO).  The ITO in this case consisted of the
    prescribed <i>Criminal Code</i> Form 1,
    dated July 19, 2006, which references three appendices (A, B, and C) consisting
    of 53 pages in total, which in turn refer to further appendices D, E, F, G, H,
    I, and J, consisting of another 125 pages.  On the basis of this ITO, a justice of the peace issued a search
    warrant, and the police conducted a search of townhouse #77 including the
    respondent’s room in the basement.  During
    that search, the police located a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition in the
    respondent’s room, which were the basis of the charges the he faced.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Proceedings at Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent re-elected to be tried by a judge
    without a jury in the Superior Court of Justice, and pled not guilty to all
    charges.  Prior to the Crown calling any
    evidence, the respondent brought an application to exclude the evidence of the
    shotgun and ammunition seized by the police from his room.  The basis of the application was that the ITO
    prepared in the course of the murder investigation was overly broad and
    insufficient as it related to the respondent’s room, that the search of his
    room infringed his s. 8 right to be secure from unreasonable search or seizure,
    and that the evidence should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application record, containing a copy of the ITO,
    was filed as an exhibit, as was a diagram of the townhouse complex, a floor
    plan of all three levels of townhouse #77, and a transcription of the respondent’s
    interview with the police.  There was no <i>viva voce</i> evidence adduced by the
    applicant or the Crown.  After hearing
    submissions from the respondent’s counsel and the Crown, the trial judge
    granted the application and excluded the evidence of the shotgun and
    ammunition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon receiving that ruling, the Crown elected to call
    no evidence, and the respondent was found not guilty of all the charges he
    faced.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='line-height:200%'>Ruling by the Trial Court</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge framed the issue to be determined as
    whether the affiant of the ITO established reasonable grounds to believe that
    there was evidence to be found in the place to be searched, which in the case
    of the respondent was his room.  The
    trial judge also indicated that, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]<span class=GramE>he</span> task of the
    reviewing justice is more limited than that of the authorizing justice.  The reviewing justice must determine whether
    the authorizing justice could have granted the warrant on the basis of the
    record presented to him or her as amplified on review ... [T]he question is
    simply whether there was at least some evidence that might reasonably be
    believed on the basis of which the authorization could have been issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found four main problems with the ITO
    in this case, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The backgrounds of the three male residents, the
    respondent, <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell, and Ryder were unfairly
    “melded” to suggest any one of them could have been involved with the murder.  Because the murder likely had a sexual nature
    to it, only <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell’s criminal background was
    relevant to the offence for which the warrant was being sought.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    familiarity and knowledge of all the tenants about each other’s comings and
    goings and dealings was exaggerated.  At
    most, the connection between the tenants, beyond their shared address, was the
    opportunity to have participated in the offence, but opportunity does not
    amount to the grounds necessary for a warrant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    “possibility” indicated in the ITO that the residents’ rooms could be insecure,
    thus allowing the offence and disposal of the body to be committed in any of

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Review of Ruling on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Grant</i> (1999), <span class=ssl21><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>132 C.C.C. (3d) 531</span></span> (Ont.

    )), this court clearly set the
    standard of review that an appellate court should utilize in an appeal of a
    review of the issuance of a warrant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he usual deference
    is owed to the findings of the trial judge in her assessment of the record “as
    amplified on the review” and her disposition of the s. 8 application.  In the absence of an error of law, a
    misapprehension of the evidence or a failure to consider relevant evidence,
    this court should not interfere with the trial judge's conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge framed the issue and her task
    correctly.  However, upon review of her
    ruling and the trial record, I would conclude she failed to consider relevant
    evidence, and misapprehended evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the trial judge explicitly and in my view
    improperly focussed on a relatively brief portion of the ITO in her reasons,
    namely a two and a half page section at the end of Appendix C, entitled
    “Grounds to Believe That Things are at the Place to be <span class=GramE>Searched</span>”.  It is important to note that this section
    appears near the end of a fifty page narrative in the ITO, which as a whole
    describes the series of events and investigative steps taken in this murder
    investigation to that point.  If
    anything, the section might best be described as a summary of some of the
    salient grounds.  The Form 1 in this case,
    the document required by s. 487 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, clearly directs the reader to Appendix C for the grounds on which the
    affiant believes items will be found at the place to be searched.  The Form does not highlight any particular
    part of Appendix C. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, a narrow focus on the summary section
    is inconsistent with the legal requirement that the issuing justice of the
    peace act judicially, which would include diligently and independently
    reviewing the entire ITO and considering all of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An apt example of the problem inherent in the trial
    judge’s focus on the summary section of Appendix C is her concern about the
    following statement in that section.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Each of the above males is known to the police for
    various criminal offences (although not associated) where there is a history of
    sexual assaults and domestic violence.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The trial judge found that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By making this very broad and arguably misleading
    assertion, the Affiant melds the three tenants together to suggest, somewhat
    disingenuously, that any one of them could have been involved in the murder.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>However, immediately after this statement in Appendix C, the
    ITO clearly states in parentheses, “Refer to Appendix’s [sic] I, E, AND F for
    complete details.”  Appendix F sets out
    the detailed police records of the respondent’s criminal record of assaults, as
    well as all other police contacts with him.  These records indicated that he had a significant history of violence,
    including violence against women.  He had
    convictions for assault, assault causing bodily harm, and obstructing a police
    officer.  The ITO sets out the
    respondent’s criminal background clearly and distinctly from that of the other
    two tenants.  Moreover, within the
    lengthy narrative in Appendix C are clear and separate references to when the
    police conducted the searches of their databases with respect to each of the
    respondent and the other two tenants, the records they found, as well as
    references to the respective appendices where the records themselves can be
    found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apparent the trial judge considered the above
    statement disingenuous because she read it as implying that all the tenants had
    a reputation for sexual assaults.  The
    trial judge found this objectionable, evidently on the presumption that the
    murder was committed in the course of a sexual assault.  The circumstances, including the fact that the
    victim’s lower body was not clothed and her legs were bound, gave the trial
    judge good reason to believe that.  However,
    there was no conclusive evidence that that was so.  The references to the autopsy performed were
    simply about cause of death and the scissors found implanted in the upper body.  No specific evidence of a sexual assault was
    indicated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the trial judge relied on <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Debot</span></i>, [1989]
    2 S.C.R. 1140, in deciding that it was only <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell,
    who was facing serious sexual assault charges, whose reputation was relevant to
    the search.  In my view she applied the
    principle in <span class=SpellE><i>Debot</i></span> – that reputation evidence as part of the purported grounds to conduct a search
    must be related to the ostensible reasons for the search – too narrowly.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Debot</i></span>, Wilson J. provided, at para. 58, as a negative
    example of this principle that a background for driving offences would have
    little relevance to drug trafficking.  In
    contrast, the respondent’s background for violence directed towards women is related
    to the reason for this search warrant, the investigation into the violent death
    of a woman.  It is worth noting that of
    the tenants of the <span class=GramE>townhouse,</span> only the respondent had
    been convicted of offences involving violence against women.  In referring to the respondent’s record as “an
    unrelated criminal record”, the trial judge erred in disregarding evidence that
    was in fact relevant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another example of the problem inherent in focussing
    too narrowly on one part of the ITO is the trial judge’s explanation of why she
    did not consider relevant the information that the respondent had used black
    bags and luggage when he moved into the townhouse.  She simply stated that this information was
    not pursued with the respondent in his interview and was not reiterated in the
    summary section.  The fact the police did
    not emphasize this information, is not an adequate reason for discounting it.
    Discounting it does not accord with the relative importance and numerous
    references throughout the ITO to the black bag in which the body was found. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The black bag, which is clearly highly relevant to the
    investigation as it was used to dispose of the body, was described variously as
    a gym, hockey, <span class=GramE>duffel</span> and sports bag.  It was listed in the property section of the
    occurrence report for this investigation, which was included as Appendix J, as
    “Sports Equipment – Additional Description: 2 straps and zipper, Make: Hockey bag,
    Model: Sport, Primary Colour: Black …” Also, it was related to items listed in
    Appendix A, a list of the items to be searched for in the dwelling.  Among many other things in Appendix A, “any
    sport bag or similar with Brand name ‘Sport’” and “any receipts for such a
    Sport bag” were listed as items to be searched for in the dwelling.  The reference in the ITO to the respondent
    moving in with black bags and luggage is the only reference to anyone having
    had a black bag.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that the trial judge focused too narrowly
    on one part of the ITO, to the apparent exclusion of other parts of the ITO, I
    find there to have been a failure to consider relevant evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another area in which the trial judge fell into error
    was in her ruling, albeit in the context of her s. 24(2) analysis, where she said,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I recognize that precise drafting is not a
    precondition for a valid warrant.  However,
    in my view, given the experience of the Affiant expressed in the ITO, and the <b><i>pervasive
    lack of transparency</i></b> about the living arrangements and the criminal
    histories of the various tenants, this drafting was not just imprecise, <b><i>it
    was intentionally confusing and opaque</i></b>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>She later repeated her concerns: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The ITO as it related to Mr. Campbell was
    inadequate and grounded in vague and ambiguous assertions that, in my view,
    intentionally commingled the living space and reputations of the tenants.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>With respect, upon my review of the record in this case, I fail
    to find the basis on which the trial judge could have found that there was a
    pervasive lack of transparency or that the ITO was intentionally confusing or
    opaque. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The formal <i>Criminal
    Code</i> Form 1 “Information to Obtain Search Warrant”, names the place to be
    searched as the “Dwelling – Rooming House [of] <span class=SpellE>Yasmin</span> ASHAREH, William IMONA-RUSSELL, Gregory RYDER, and Norman CAMPBELL [at] 246
    John Garland Blvd., Unit#77, in the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto”.  So at the very outset, the ITO alerts any
    reader that the place to be searched is a rooming house and there were four
    people residing there (including the deceased).  Even in the summary section that the trial judge focussed on, the first
    sentence is:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the address of
    Unit #77 is that of a rooming house, where occupants have private rooms and
    common areas, the affiant will be seeking a Search Warrant for the entire
    premise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary of the interview of the landlord in the ITO
    is clear in setting out the living accommodations of the respective tenants in
    the rooming house.  It is clear that the
    deceased, <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell, and Ryder had rooms on the
    second floor and that the respondent was in the basement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There may have been a minor discrepancy in that the
    landlord described the respondent as having a room in the basement, and that
    the house had a bathroom on the second floor and a kitchen on the first floor.  From the evidence admitted at trial, it
    appears there is also a kitchen and bathroom in the basement and the respondent
    described it as an apartment rather than a room.  However, on all the evidence there is no
    issue that the respondent had to go through the first floor area common to all
    the tenants to get to the basement.  The
    landlord also indicated that each tenant had a lock on his or her door, and it
    is not clear from the record whether the respondent’s lock is on his room, or
    on a door to the entire basement.  In my
    view, not much turns on this ambiguity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have noted already, specific information about the
    respondent’s criminal record and prior contact with police was clearly
    referenced and fully disclosed in Appendix F of the ITO.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find no evidence in the ITO or trial record to
    support a finding that there was a pervasive lack of transparency in the ITO in
    setting out the tenants’ accommodations in this rooming house and the criminal
    histories of the male tenants.  I see no
    basis for finding that there was an intention to make these matters confusing
    or opaque, or as the trial judge implied earlier in her ruling that the affiant
    had been disingenuous in respect of these matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, perhaps the trial judge also had in mind the
    personal relationships among the tenants when she found that there was a
    pervasive lack of transparency about their living arrangements.  Earlier in her reasons, she had found the
    following statement in the ITO troubling:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All [the tenants] would have direct knowledge and have
    stated so in their interviews of knowing when the other tenants come and go and
    who is doing what with <span class=GramE>who</span>.  This would then allow them to be in a
    position to carry out whatever actions they wished and any subsequent clean-up
    with little or no chance of being seen.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span style='line-height:200%'>Again these statements are found in the summary
    section of the ITO.  Upon reviewing the
    entire ITO including the summaries of the police interviews with the tenants,
    it is quite clear that not every tenant had the familiarity with and knowledge
    of each other that the statement above implies.  For example, the summary of the respondent’s interview set out earlier in
    the ITO specifically seems to indicate otherwise in stating, “He does not spend
    much time in the house and does not really know the other occupants.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the trial judge found another statement
    troubling in this ITO.  Again, the
    statement appears in the summary section at the end of Appendix C.  It reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With the possibility that the individual rooms are
    not properly secured, it would allow the perpetrator an opportunity to carry
    out this murder and disposal of the deceased in any room of the dwelling.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The trial judge found this statement to be “mere speculation,
    and not rooted in a credibly based probability.”  If the statement is regarded as a statement
    of fact, it fails to accord with the information from the landlord that the
    tenants had locks on their door. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that these statements were incorrect,
    they should have been excluded from the ITO, and the reviewing trial judge
    should have then continued to evaluate the balance of the ITO to determine
    whether there were sufficient grounds for the issuance of the search warrant:
    see <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Araujo</span>,</i> [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992, at para. 58.  See
    also <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Morelli</span></i> [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at para. 41.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did carry out an analysis of the
    balance of the grounds as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is, in essence, nothing more than proximity,
    a generic receipt for delivery of Chinese food about which there is no
    information to indicate that any steps were taken to ascertain who may have
    ordered the food, and an unrelated criminal record. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>She concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that the ITO is deficient in establishing a
    specific basis for believing that evidence of the murder could be found in Mr.
    Campbell’s separate apartment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For all these reasons, I am not persuaded that the
    totality of the information establishes a nexus between the murder and Mr.
    Campbell’s apartment such that the authorizing judge could have made the
    inference that there may be some evidence in Mr. Campbell’s apartment.  Given the physical layout of the building,
    the approach was simply too general to justify a search of Mr. Campbell’s
    residence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, she erred by not taking
    into account all the relevant evidence. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Review of the Issuance of the Warrant to Search</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the trial judge failed to consider relevant
    evidence and misapprehended parts of the evidence, it follows that this court
    cannot extend the usual deference to the trial judge’s analysis.  It falls to this court to determine whether
    there was a basis upon which the warrant could issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How a court should proceed when an application pursuant
    to s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> has been
    brought to challenge the issuance of a warrant and the standard of review it should
    apply are well established.  The salient
    principles were succinctly summarized by Fish J., writing recently for the
    majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class=SpellE><i>Morelli</i></span>, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    39-43.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under the Charter, before a search can be
    conducted, the police must provide reasonable and probable grounds, established
    upon oath, to believe that an offence has been committed and that there is
    evidence to be found at the place of the search.  These distinct and cumulative requirements
    together form part of the minimum standard consistent with s. 8 of the Charter
    for authorizing search and seizure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In reviewing the sufficiency of a warrant
    application, however, the test is whether there was reliable evidence that
    might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could have
    issued.  The question is not whether the
    reviewing court would itself have issued the warrant, but whether there was
    sufficient credible and reliable evidence to permit a justice of the peace to
    find reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence had been
    committed and that evidence of that offence would be found at the specified
    time and place.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reviewing court does not undertake its review
    solely on the basis of the ITO as it was presented to the justice of the peace.  Rather, the reviewing court must exclude
    erroneous information included in the original ITO.  Furthermore, the reviewing court may have
    reference to “amplification” evidence - that is, additional evidence presented
    at the <span class=SpellE><i>voir</i></span><i> dire</i> to correct minor errors in the ITO
    - so long as this additional evidence corrects good faith errors of the police
    in preparing the ITO, rather than deliberate attempts to mislead the
    authorizing justice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Quotation marks and citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as previously mentioned, there was
    additional evidence admitted in the form of a diagram of the townhouse complex
    and a diagram of townhouse #77, as well as the police interview of the
    respondent.  This “amplification” of the
    ITO does not do much more than clarify the layout of the townhouse &#8722; that
    there was a living room and a dining room on the first floor, and a bathroom
    and kitchen in the basement &#8722; and add the respondent’s attitude that his
    was a separate apartment in the basement.  I take this to only have the import that the kitchen and bathroom in the
    basement were not common space with the other tenants, and that the respondent
    would then not likely have used the common areas on the first floor except to
    get to the basement.  This does not
    change the overall picture that was explicit and clear in the ITO read as a
    whole – that the respondent did not spend much time in the house and did not
    really know the other tenants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have indicated earlier, there were statements in
    the summary section that were inaccurate.  However, the accurate information is set out
    so clearly in the ITO as a whole, the inaccurate statements alone do not
    support the inference they were made with the intention to mislead.  Therefore, I would exclude these statements
    from the ITO, and carry out the analysis on the balance of the ITO. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In carrying out that analysis it is important to keep
    in mind throughout the analysis that the warrant is presumed to be valid and
    the correct question is whether the respondent has established that there was
    no basis for its authorization.  This
    point cannot be stressed too much.  The
    presumption means that the decision of the issuing justice must be upheld
    unless the applicant meets the burden of demonstrating its invalidity.  The Supreme Court has made this clear.</p>

    in being left alone at the point where credibly-based probability replaces

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later, in <span class=SpellE><i>Debot</i></span><i>,</i> at p. 1166,
    Wilson J., without alluding to the term “credibly-based probability”, described
    the standard of proof as one of “reasonable probability” or “reasonable belief”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most recently the<i> dicta</i> of <span class=SpellE>Deschamps</span> J. in <span class=SpellE><i>Morelli</i></span><i>, </i>at para. <span class=GramE>129,</span> are helpful in
    understanding the standard.  Although she
    was writing for a minority of three out of seven justices of the Supreme Court
    of Canada, the following comments are not inconsistent with the majority
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Determining whether evidence gives rise to a “credibly-based
    probability” does not involve parsing the facts or assessing them
    mathematically.  Rather, what the judge
    must do is identify credible facts that make the decision to authorize a search
    reasonable in view of all the circumstances.  I therefore agree with the non-technical, common-sense approach taken by
    Rehnquist J. (as he then was) in <i>Illinois
    v. Gates</i>, 462 U.S. 213 (1983):</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The task of the
    issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision
    whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him,
    including the “veracity” and “basis of knowledge” of persons supplying hearsay information,
    there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be
    found in a particular place. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court and this court have referred to <i>Illinois v. Gates</i> in earlier cases.  See <span class=SpellE><i>Garofoli</i></span>, at para. 61; <i>R.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No matter what formulation is used, it is essential
    that the grounds for believing there is evidence in the place to be searched
    are based on the operation of reason and not on mere suspicion.  The standard is necessarily qualitative and
    reasonable people can differ in some cases about whether the authorization
    should have been granted.  In this
    context the question for the reviewing court remains could the justice of the
    peace have issued the <span class=GramE>warrant.</span>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before applying the standard to this particular case, I
    make two observations.  First, the
    grounds for the warrant to search the respondent’s room did not have to be
    restricted to those grounds for believing that the evidence to be found would
    incriminate him.  The evidence to be
    found could incriminate any person.  A
    general search warrant issued pursuant to s. 487 the <i>Criminal Code</i> authorizes the police to search for “evidence with
    respect to the commission of an offence”.  Second, it is not relevant whether either of the other tenants may have
    had backgrounds or circumstances that made them more suspect of being involved
    in the offence than the respondent.  The
    only question for the reviewing court is whether the justice of the peace could
    have issued the warrant to search the respondent’s room.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, without reiterating the entire
    constellation of facts summarized in the ITO, I find the following salient
    facts and inferences to be important when assessing the grounds upon which the
    justice of peace could have issued the search warrant including the respondent’s
    exclusive space in the basement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The circumstances in which the deceased’s body
    was found lead to a compelling inference that the murder and/or the disposal of
    the body took place in townhouse #77.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The garbage
    bags, found beside the bag with the body, contained both items related to the
    murder and <span class=GramE>unrelated  ordinary</span> refuse that emanated from
    somewhere in the townhouse.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    living arrangements were such that the respondent had physical access to the
    common areas of the building, affording him the opportunity to be involved in
    the offence within the building.  While
    the tenants all have private rooms with locks in the building, the respondent
    had unrestricted access to the deceased’s living room, kitchen, dining room, hallways
    and bathroom.  As well he could have
    accessed her private room if she did not lock her door while in the townhouse
    or if she would have opened the door to another resident.  The issuing justice of the peace could well
    have inferred these relevant factors from the facts in the ITO. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the respondent professed little knowledge of the other tenants, including the
    deceased, he did have, by virtue of living in this building, the opportunity to
    have more knowledge than he may have been willing to indicate to the police
    about the routines of the other tenants.  This would afford him an opportunity to have been involved in this
    offence undetected by the other tenants.  The trial judge found no evidence to support this inference.  However, the issuing Justice of the Peace may
    have reasonably inferred this from the basic facts that form the nature of the
    living arrangements, as reviewed earlier.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent has a criminal history for violence, some of which was directed at
    women.  This background is very relevant
    to the investigation that was ongoing into the violent death of a woman.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally
    the deceased’s body was found in a black sports bag, and the respondent was
    reported to have moved in to this building only a few weeks earlier using black
    bags.  While the quality and specificity
    of the information about the respondent’s black bags can be argued, it is not
    for a reviewing court to weigh the import of the bags afresh.  The issuing justice of the peace could reason
    from the information about the bags and the fact they were used in moving from
    one residence to another that they were of a size and nature that made them
    significant to this investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the grounds were: a compelling inference
    that the murder was committed in this rooming house; the refuse found with the
    body; that the respondent was one of three people who had access to the
    deceased in the common areas of her home; the inference that the respondent had
    the opportunity to have committed the murder in the absence of the other
    tenants; the respondent’s background for violence against women; and specific information
    that the respondent used black bags when he moved into the residence.  Considered independently each of these
    grounds may not have justified the authorization.  However, a justice of the peace could have
    found from their cumulative effect that there were reasonable grounds to issue
    the warrant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the opportunity to read the separate reasons
    of Doherty <span class=GramE>J.A..</span>  His reasons, despite their force, do not dissuade me from concluding
    that the respondent did not succeed in showing that “on the whole of the
    material presented that there was no basis for the authorization”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, I do not find it helpful to consider the
    hypothetical situation of a 100-unit apartment building.  The tenants in this townhouse, unlike tenants
    of a 100-unit building, had access not only to the deceased’s front door, but
    to her bedroom door, and to the shared bathroom, kitchen, dining room and
    living room.  The tenants of a 100 unit
    apartment building can exit their bedroom and walk to their bathroom in
    complete privacy.  That is not the case
    in this townhouse.  The issuing justice
    could have viewed the tenants’ residences in this townhouse as connected and
    overlapping unlike those in a large apartment building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One might equally consider an example at the opposite
    extreme.  If the police saw a person carrying
    a machine gun and a bag of heroin enter a townhouse shared by two persons with
    locked bedrooms and then exit without the gun and heroin, could they search
    only the common areas of the townhouse if they had no information whatsoever
    about each of the two tenants?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Hypotheticals</span>, while helpful
    to refining the analysis, suffer from the lack of detail that a real life
    situation has.  In this case it is
    unnecessary to resolve the issues that would arise in either of these <span
class=SpellE>hypotheticals</span>.  This
    appeal turns on the entire set of circumstances involving this particular
    townhouse shared by these four tenants.  In
    this townhouse, the issuing justice would have understood that the deceased’s
    bedroom was on the second floor but that she lived in the townhouse.  It was not necessary for the respondent to go
    the second floor to commit the crime.  He
    had the opportunity to encounter her as she used the other areas of the
    townhouse in which she lived. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the significance of other matters about which
    Doherty J.A. and I disagree, for example the black bags and the police’s other
    contacts with the respondent, I take the view that the issuing justice could
    have found they added to the cumulative effect of all the circumstances and
    issued the warrant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all of these reasons, I would find the search and
    seizure were constitutional.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude the trial judge should not have
    excluded the sawed-off shotgun and ammunition found in the respondent’s
    room.  I would set aside the acquittals
    entered by the trial judge, and remit the charges back to the Superior Court of
    Justice for trial.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juriansz J.A. concludes that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence and failed to consider evidence relevant to the
    validity of the warrant.  I agree that
    the trial judge misapprehended the evidence when she described the respondent’s
    criminal record as “unrelated”.  I also
    agree that the trial judge failed to consider the entirety of the sworn
    information to obtain (“ITO”) the search warrant in reaching her conclusion
    that it was “intentionally confusing”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s errors do not, however, in and of
    themselves, entitle the Crown to a new trial.  To succeed on this appeal, the Crown must demonstrate that on a proper
    appreciation of the evidentiary record the trial judge erred in law in
    excluding from evidence the gun and ammunition found during the search of the
    respondent’s residence.  To do that, the
    Crown must show either that the trial judge erred in holding that the search
    was unconstitutional, or that even if the search was unconstitutional the trial
    judge erred in excluding the evidence obtained in that search.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The constitutionality of the search of the respondent’s
    residence turned on the validity of the warrant authorizing that search.  The trial judge concluded that the warrant
    should not have been granted and that the search was, therefore, unconstitutional.  The trial judge’s finding was, however,
    tainted by her misapprehension of the evidence and her failure to consider the
    entirety of the record.  Those errors do
    not, however, mean that the trial judge was necessarily wrong in holding that
    the warrant should not have been granted.  The errors committed by the trial judge mean that this court should not
    defer to the trial judge’s findings in determining the validity of the warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The validity of the warrant and, hence, the
    constitutionality of the search of the respondent’s residence turned on whether
    an authorizing justice, acting judicially, could have concluded, on the basis
    of the ITO as supplemented by the material filed on the motion at trial, that
    there were reasonable grounds to believe that a search of the respondent’s
    residence would reveal evidence relevant to the deceased’s homicide.  If the material in the ITO as supplemented on
    the motion met that standard, then the warrant was properly issued, the search
    was constitutional and the admissibility of the fruits of that search
    undeniable.  If the material did not meet
    that standard, the search violated the respondent’s right guaranteed by s. 8 of
    the Canadian <i>Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</i> and the admissibility of the evidence obtained in the search
    turned on the application of s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>III</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Validity of the Warrant</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juriansz J.A. has thoroughly reviewed the contents of
    the ITO and the additional material put forward on the motion.  I need not repeat that exercise.  I would, however, emphasize two aspects of
    the record.  First, there were strong
    grounds to believe that the deceased was murdered and that her murder occurred
    in, or was otherwise connected to the townhouse where she lived.  Second, the townhouse operated as a rooming
    house.  There were four separate
    residences in the townhouse.  Three were
    located on the second floor.  According
    to the landlord, the tenants shared a kitchen on the main floor and a bathroom
    on the second floor.  The respondent’s
    room was in the basement.  There was a
    kitchen and a washroom in the basement.  Each of the tenants had a lock for the door on their respective
    rooms.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the police could search the respondent’s
    residence, they were required to establish reasonable grounds referable to his
    specific residence.  It was particularly
    important in respect of the respondent’s privacy rights that the adequacy of
    the grounds relied on to justify the search of his residence be considered
    separately from the adequacy of the grounds relied on to justify the search of
    the rest of the townhouse.  The ITO set
    out strong grounds justifying a search of the rooms of the other two male
    tenants, the deceased’s room, and the common areas of the townhouse.  Whatever might be said about the grounds justifying
    the search of the respondent’s residence, they were far from strong.  There was a substantial risk that the
    respondent’s individual privacy interest in respect of his residence would be
    lost in the force of the evidence supporting the search of the other residences
    in the townhouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juriansz J.A. identifies four areas of evidence which,
    in his view, taken as a whole support the issuance of the warrant to search the
    respondent’s residence.  They are:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence of the respondent’s criminal record;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence of the respondent’s opportunity to have
    attacked and killed the deceased in the townhouse;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence concerning the contents of the garbage
    bags found with the body of the deceased; and</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>evidence</span> concerning the
    “black bags”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will examine each of the four areas of the evidence
    bearing in mind that it is the cumulative effect of the evidence, which must be
    capable of justifying the issuance of the warrant.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(i)</span><span
lang=EN-US>     The Criminal Record</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ITO attached the respondent’s criminal record as an
    appendix.  Other computer printouts were
    also attached to the ITO indicating that the respondent had numerous other
    “contacts” with the police.  For the
    purpose of determining whether there was a basis upon which to issue the
    warrant, I distinguish between the criminal record and the other
    “contacts”.  The criminal record provided
    information that was potentially probative on the application for the
    warrant.  In my view, the computer list
    of other “contacts” with the police had no probative value.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s criminal record consists of six
    convictions entered between September 1999 and November 2005.  He has four convictions for assault, one for
    assault causing bodily harm, and one for obstructing police.  He received either non-custodial sentences or
    short custodial sentences followed by periods of probation.  According to the ITO, some of his criminal
    “charges” were “domestic related”.  The
    ITO does not identify any of the convictions as domestic assaults.  However, one entry in the computer printouts
    does begin with the phrase “family violence”.  Another entry in the computer printouts, apparently relating to the same
    conviction entered in November <span class=GramE>2005,</span> begins with the
    phrase “spousal assault”.  It may be that
    the November 2005 conviction for assault causing bodily harm involves an
    assault on a female partner.  Aside from
    these references, there are no details of the facts surrounding the convictions
    set out in the ITO. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s criminal record for assaultive
    behaviour is sufficiently current and has sufficient entries to justify the
    inference that he has a propensity for violence.  His record does, however, suggest a level and
    kind of violence far removed from the violence perpetrated against the victim
    whose death was being investigated.  The
    criminal record, while relevant and properly included in the ITO, provides only
    a small step toward the establishment of reasonable grounds to search the
    respondent’s residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I place no weight on the printouts listing other police
    “contacts”.  The ITO offers no explanation
    for the meaning of these various printouts and I find it impossible to discern
    the nature of the contacts or exactly what they are supposed to mean.  In my view, they do not assist in elaborating
    upon the respondent’s propensity for violence. </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)</span><span
lang=EN-US>    The Opportunity</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juriansz J.A. also concluded that the fact that the
    respondent lived in the same townhouse as the victim supported a finding that
    the police had reasonable grounds to search his room.  As a resident of that townhouse, the
    respondent had access to the common areas in the townhouse and to the second
    floor where the deceased’s room was located.  He could walk from his residence in the basement up the stairs to the
    second floor where the deceased lived.  Because he lived in the townhouse, he also had the opportunity to
    observe the comings and goings of the other roomers, including the
    deceased.  The fact that the respondent
    lived in the townhouse where the murder probably occurred and had access to the
    victim’s room and the victim in the sense described above offered some support
    on the application for a warrant to search the respondent’s residence.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was, however, nothing in the material to indicate
    that there had been any contact between the respondent and the victim in the
    three or four weeks he had lived in the townhouse.  In his interview with the police, that was
    carried out prior to their application for the warrant, the respondent
    indicated that he had never seen the victim.  There was also nothing in the material that placed the respondent on the
    second floor where the deceased lived at any time.  Nor did anything in the ITO suggest that the
    respondent had any interest in the deceased or her comings and goings inside of
    the townhouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the respondent, because he lived in the townhouse,
    had access to the victim that was not available to non-residents.  However, I do not think it can reasonably be
    concluded, based on that access, that he may have been watching her; he may
    have gained entry to her room; he may have attacked and killed her and he may
    have disposed of the body.  That chain of
    reasoning goes beyond the limits of reasonable inference drawing and enters the
    realm of speculation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find it helpful to consider another hypothetical that
    involves a different, but similar living arrangement.  If instead of a four-room townhouse, the
    deceased had lived in a 100-unit apartment building where all tenants had
    access to various common areas such as hallways, parking garages and laundry
    rooms, and could walk up to the deceased’s door, would it be reasonable to
    authorize the search of all apartments occupied by tenants who had criminal
    records indicating some propensity for assaultive behaviour?  In my view, as the probability of finding
    evidence in the room of any particular tenant is not a random event, the
    likelihood of finding evidence does not increase as the number of tenants
    decreases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I seriously doubt that anyone would countenance the
    search of the apartments of all of the tenants with criminal records for
    assault in the 100-unit apartment building.  I do not see that hypothetical as significantly different from this fact
    situation.  In each case, the basis for
    the search is premised on the opportunity to commit the crime arising from
    ready and unnoticed access to the place where the crime was committed and to
    the victim of the crime.  As Juriansz
    J.A. observes, the respondent’s right to privacy in his own room was no less
    than that of a person living in a single dwelling unit.  That observation applies with equal force the
    four-unit rooming house and the 100-unit apartment building.  </p>
  <h4><span

lang=EN-US>  The Contents of the Garbage
    Bags</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juriansz J.A. finds that the contents of the garbage
    bags found with the black bag containing the deceased’s body provided
    additional support for the search of the respondent’s residence.  The contents of those garbage bags are set
    out in my colleague’s reasons.  One piece
    of garbage, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Western Union receipt,
    connected Mr. <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell, one of the other tenants
    whose room was on the second floor, to the garbage.  Some of the contents of the garbage also
    belonged to the deceased.  Nothing in the
    ITO connected any of the garbage to the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my reading of the ITO, there is nothing to suggest
    that anything in the garbage bags could reasonably be seen to connect the
    respondent to the homicide, or could reasonably be seen to support the
    inference that there was evidence in his residence relevant to the
    homicide.  While the police certainly had
    good reason to investigate the contents and source of the garbage, a legitimate
    investigative interest does not justify a search unless there are reasonable
    grounds to believe that evidence relevant to the offence will be found in the
    place to be searched.  The police have
    many investigative options available to them.  However, the search of an individual’s home is not one of those options
    unless the police can establish the requisite reasonable grounds to justify the
    search.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor could the search of the respondent’s residence
    could be justified on the theory that if it yielded no evidence referable to
    the respondent, it would strengthen the evidence linking the garbage to Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell and thereby provide evidence against him in
    the homicide investigation.  A search
    warrant cannot issue under s. 487 on the basis that even though there may be no
    reasonable grounds to believe that “anything” will be found in the place to be
    searched that could “afford evidence” of the crime, the failure to find
    evidence will afford evidence of the crime in the sense that it will increase
    the probative value of other evidence already in the possession of the
    police.  That approach to granting a
    search warrant is inconsistent with the language of s. 487 and would
    significantly, and I suggest dangerously, expand the search powers of the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contents of the garbage bags found along with the
    deceased’s body did not provide any support for the application for a search
    warrant to search the respondent’s residence.  I note that Crown counsel on appeal did not argue that the contents of
    the garbage bags offered any support for the issuance for the warrant to search
    the respondent’s home.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(iv)</span><span
lang=EN-US>   The Black Bags</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I come lastly to the evidence concerning the black
    bags.  The relevant part of the ITO reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=GramE>[Mr.]</span> <span class=SpellE>Imona</span>-Russell
    [the killer as it turns out] states that the guy in the basement [the
    respondent] used black bags and luggage when he moved into the house.  He had two or three bags that were all
    black.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent had moved into the townhouse a few weeks
    before the homicide.  Nothing in the
    material placed before the trial judge added any further description to the
    bags used by the respondent when he moved into the townhouse.  The deceased’s body was found inside a large
    black bag described as a hockey or sports bag.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the authorizing justice, acting judicially, could
    reasonably infer a potential connection between the black bags used by the
    respondent when he moved into the apartment and the large black bag in which
    the deceased’s body was found there would be a strong basis for the issuance of
    the warrant to search the respondent’s residence.  I do not think that connection can be made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the ITO that would justify any
    inference as to the size or shape of the black bags possessed by the respondent
    when he moved into the townhouse.  It
    does not follow that because he had them with him when he moved into the <span
class=GramE>townhouse,</span> the black bags were more likely to be a
    particular size or shape.  Absent a basis
    upon which some inference could be drawn as to the size or the shape of the
    bags in the respondent’s possession I do not see how any connection can be
    drawn between them and the bag in which the deceased’s body was found.  The affiant of the ITO did not allege any
    potential connection between the bags said to be in the respondent’s possession
    when he moved into the townhouse and the bag in which the body was found.  Evidence that the respondent had black bags
    of unknown size and shape a few weeks before the homicide does not, in my view,
    provide a reasonable basis for any inference connecting the respondent to the
    black bag in which the body was found.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(v)</span><span
lang=EN-US>     Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my analysis of the ITO and the material filed on the
    motion, the Crown is left only with the respondent’s criminal record and the
    fact that he lived in the building where the homicide in all likelihood
    occurred.  Those two facts certainly made
    the respondent an appropriate subject of police investigation.  For the reasons I have endeavoured to
    explain, however, they did not establish a basis upon which an authorizing
    justice, acting judicially, could be satisfied that there were reasonable
    grounds to believe that evidence relevant to the homicide would be found in the
    respondent’s home.  The search warrant
    should not have been issued.  The search
    was unconstitutional.  </p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>IV</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Admissibility of the Gun and Ammunition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge excluded the gun and ammunition from
    evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  In doing so, she found that the ITO was
    drafted in a manner that was “intentionally confusing and opaque”.  The trial judge described the breach of the
    appellant’s s. 8 <span class=GramE>right</span> as “serious” and ultimately
    concluded that even though the evidence was real evidence and its exclusion of
    the evidence would frustrate the prosecution of serious offences, the administration
    of justice required that the evidence be excluded.  The essence of her reasoning is captured in
    the final paragraph of her judgment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… <span class=GramE>the</span> breach was
    serious.  The ITO as it related to Mr.
    Campbell was inadequate and ground in vague and ambiguous assertions that, in
    my view, intentionally comingled the living space and reputations of the
    tenants.  It authorized a search of Mr.
    Campbell’s residence, a location that has the highest expectation of privacy,
    when the foundation for the search was mere suspicion.  In my view, the repute of the administration
    of justice will be better served by the exclusion of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis tracked the then
    controlling three-part test first announced in <i>R. v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.  After the trial was completed but before the appeal came on for hearing,
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v.
    Grant</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, reformulated the approach to be taken in
    determining admissibility under s. 24(2).  Crown counsel and counsel for the respondent agree that on appeal the
    correctness of the trial judge’s decision must be determined under the
    reformulated approach to admissibility under s. 24(2) set down in <i>Grant</i>: see <i>R. v. Blake</i> (2010), 251 C.C.C. (3d) 4 (Ont. C.A.).  In applying <i>Grant</i> I bear in mind that while the approach to determining
    admissibility has been reworked in <i>Grant</i>,
    the factors relevant to the admissibility have not changed: see <i>R. v. Beaulieu</i> (2010), 251 C.C.C. (3d)
    455 (S.C.C.) at para. 7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court is also obliged to show considerable
    deference to the trial judge’s s. 24(2) assessment unless the court is
    satisfied that the assessment is tainted by a failure to consider relevant
    factors or by unreasonable findings.  As
    indicated at outset of these reasons, I agree with Juriansz J.A. that the trial
    judge’s characterization of the ITO as “intentionally confusing and opaque” is
    unreasonable.  Although I think the
    organization of the ITO can be criticized, all of the relevant information was
    in the ITO.  I do not think the affiant
    can reasonably be said to have intended to confuse the justice when he put all
    of the relevant information before the justice.  One must assume that the justice reads the entire ITO with care.  Consequently, in considering s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>, I reject the trial judge’s
    finding that the affiant set out to intentionally confuse and thereby mislead
    the authorizing justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I would not describe the ITO as intentionally
    confusing, I think it can properly be criticized for failing to sufficiently
    separate and identify the grounds relied upon to justify the search of each of
    the four residences contained in the townhouse.  In <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Morelli</span></i> (2010), 252 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (S.C.C.) at para. 102, Fish J. for the majority
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Police officers seeking search warrants are bound to
    act with diligence and integrity, taking care to discharge the special duties
    of candour and full disclosure that attach in <i>ex parte</i> proceedings.  In
    discharging those duties responsibly, they must guard against making statements
    that are likely to mislead the justice of the peace.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ITO did not achieve the high standard described in <span class=SpellE><i>Morelli</i></span>.  The ITO presented an evidentiary picture that
    made the case for the search of the townhouse as a whole, as opposed to making
    the case that should have been made, for the search of each of the individual
    residences in the townhouse.  While I see
    no basis to suggest that the affiant intentionally drew the ITO to avoid
    focusing on the individual privacy rights in issue, the manner in which the ITO
    was drawn would have inevitably led the authorizing justice to see his or her
    options as either to issue a warrant to search the townhouse or to refuse to
    issue any warrant.  On the material
    contained in the ITO, there was no realistic possibility of an outright refusal
    of the warrant.  The ITO is properly
    criticized as failing to give sufficient attention to the individual
    constitutional privacy interests placed in jeopardy by the search warrant
    application.  Bearing that criticism in
    mind, I turn to the evidentiary inquiry described in <i>Grant</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have examined the application of the <i>Grant</i> criteria to evidence obtained by
    way of an unconstitutional search in two recent cases: see <i>R. v. Blake</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Ramage</span></i>,
    (2010) ONCA 488, at para. 44 and following.  I will not repeat that analysis in detail but will instead move directly
    to my conclusions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first of the <i>Grant</i> criteria requires an examination of the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i>-infringing state conduct. That conduct is placed on a continuum
    ranging from wilful misconduct to blameless conduct.  The police cannot be criticized for seeking a
    warrant in this case.  Nor can the police
    be criticized for the manner in which the warrant was exercised.  I have already indicated why I reject the
    trial judge’s finding of a deliberate attempt to mislead the authorizing
    justice.  There was, however, as I have
    described above, a failure to properly appreciate and identify the different
    privacy interest at stake and to relate the grounds on which the warrant was
    sought to those individual privacy interests.  While I accept that there is no basis to find that the affiant
    intentionally misled the issuing justice, I am satisfied that the manner in
    which the relevant material was presented in the ITO fell below the high
    standard described in <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Morelli</span></i>, <i>supra</i>.  To meet that standard, the ITO should have
    focused more sharply on the individual privacy interests at stake on the
    application.   The affiant could have met
    that standard by addressing separately, at some point in the ITO, the basis for
    the application as it related to each of the residences in the townhouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second factor identified in <i>Grant</i>, the impact of the breach on the <i>Charter</i>-protected interest of the accused, points strongly toward exclusion
    of this evidence.  There are few, if any,
    contexts in which a person has a higher expectation of privacy than that which
    he or she has in respect of his or her home.  The search struck directly at the core of the respondent’s
    constitutional right to privacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third factor identified in <i>Grant</i>, society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on the
    merits favours admissibility and has strong application in this case.  The unauthorized possession of a firearm is a
    serious offence, particularly where the firearm is a prohibited sawed-off
    shotgun.  That weapon can be used for
    little else other than to commit violent crimes.  The evidence is entirely reliable.  Exclusion would frustrate the prosecution and
    prevent a trial on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Blake</i> the
    court addressed the admissibility of cocaine discovered in the course of an
    unconstitutional search of the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> home.  In holding that the evidence was properly
    admitted, this court stressed at para. 33 the absence of any basis upon which
    to criticize the police conduct either in the obtaining or the execution of
    what was eventually determined to be an invalid warrant.  I observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If there were a taint of impropriety, <i>or even inattention to constitutional
    standards</i>, to be found in the police conduct, that might well be enough to
    tip the scales in favour of exclusion, given the very deleterious effect on the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> legitimate privacy interests. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent has the same privacy interest that was
    at stake in <i>Blake</i>.  The nature of the evidence is the same in
    both cases.  In this case, however, the
    contents of the ITO reveal an “inattention to constitutional standards” in that
    they fail to identify and address the respondent’s individual privacy
    interest.  That failure renders the state’s
    conduct more serious than the state conduct in <i>Blake</i> and tips the scales in favour of excluding the fruits of the
    unconstitutional search.  I would affirm
    the trial judge’s ruling excluding the evidence.  </p>
