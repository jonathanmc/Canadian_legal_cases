  <p class=headingNUMBER><a name=Text11>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction, on December 1,
    2004, for the first degree murder of his cousin, Patrice Bailey, before </a><span
class=SpellE>Dambrot</span> J. sitting with a jury. He appeals his conviction
    on the ground that the trial judge erred in admitting prejudicial evidence and
    he seeks to introduce fresh evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s semen was found in the victim’s vagina
    and his DNA under her fingernails. His semen was also found on a comforter in
    her apartment. The appellant testified that they had been involved in a
    consensual but secret sexual relationship and that they happened to meet two
    days prior to the victim’s death in a fast food restaurant where they had
    consensual sex in a stall in the men’s washroom. The trial judge permitted the
    Crown to lead evidence to refute the appellant’s testimony about the existence
    of a consensual sexual relationship between himself and the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in admitting the evidence of the appellant’s alleged sexual assault on the
    victim’s best friend. The appellant challenges the trial judge’s evaluation and
    balancing of the probative value and the potential prejudice of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In thorough and
    careful reasons, the trial judge clearly articulated and applied the law
    concerning the admissibility of evidence of bad character and discreditable
    conduct by the accused. He determined that the victim’s knowledge of the sexual
    incident involving her best friend was powerful evidence that the victim would
    not likely have consented to sex with the appellant and concluded that the
    relevance of the evidence was sufficiently high, and its cogency sufficiently
    strong, such that <span class=GramE>its</span> probative value outweighed any
    potential for misuse. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We conclude that the trial judge did not err in
    evaluating the relevance and probative value of the evidence, in assessing the
    potential moral and reasoning prejudice of the evidence or in his balancing of
    the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial impact. Nor do we
    find that he erred in concluding that the victim’s best friend should be
    allowed to testify as to some details of the sexual incident even though it was
    unclear how much the victim knew. This was necessary to avoid confusing the
    jury or leaving the jury with an unfair or artificial impression of the
    evidence. The exercise of his discretion was reasonable. Further, the trial
    judge clearly instructed the jury on three different occasions regarding the
    limited use of this evidence. We give no effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s second ground of appeal is that the
    trial judge erred by permitting the Crown to adduce the victim’s <i>ante mortem</i> statements about her
    hostility or discomfort with the appellant, primarily through the evidence of
    Mark Martin, the victim’s boyfriend and an alternate suspect at trial. The
    appellant submits that, in light of all the surrounding circumstances, the
    evidence did not meet the threshold reliability.  The surrounding circumstances include the lack
    of corroborating evidence as well as the lack of an opportunity to
    cross-examine the victim as to whether she made the statements and her motives
    in making such statements. The appellant argues that the trial judge failed to
    exercise his gate keeping function, that he overstated the relevance and that
    he understated the prejudicial impact of the evidence. The appellant’s
    submission is that Mr. Martin’s status as an alternate suspect made the
    evidence inherently suspect and untrustworthy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once again, the trial judge found that the evidence had
    significant probative value to the victim’s state of mind and the likelihood
    that she would have consented to sex with the appellant. He considered the
    arguments the appellant is making again on appeal about the accuracy and
    reliability of the evidence. He found that the evidence of the victim’s best
    friend strengthened the evidence of Mr. Martin. He considered whether the
    weaknesses of Mr. Martin’s evidence impacted on the threshold reliability of
    the hearsay statements and concluded that while these would be live issues for
    the jury, they did not preclude admission of the evidence. He recognized his
    discretion to exclude the evidence and weighed the probative value against the
    potential for prejudice. He found that Mr. Martin’s motive to lie could be
    fully explored in cross-examination and would be a matter for the jury to
    consider. We find no basis to disturb these conclusions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the appellant seeks to introduce fresh
    evidence of <span class=SpellE>Anh</span> Trinh’s telephone conversation with a
    prosecutor that took place two days after the verdict that she “was seeing
    Mark”.  The appellant also seeks to
    introduce the post trial examinations of <span class=SpellE>Anh</span> Trinh
    and Mark Martin permitted on application by this court. The appellant submits
    that the statement to the prosecutor undermines the testimony of Mr. Martin and
    Ms. Trinh that they were ‘just friends’; that this in turn is significant to Mr.
    Martin’s description of a serious monogamous relationship with the victim; and
    that any evidence bearing on the credibility of an alternate suspect must be a
    decisive or potentially decisive issue in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the meaning and the significance of the
    statement to the prosecutor is far from clear. The issue of the relationship
    between Mr. Martin and Ms. Trinh was vigorously explored in cross-examination
    at trial. Their subsequent testimony on this application was consistent with
    their evidence at trial. There was before the jury evidence that raised
    questions about the nature of the relationship between Mr. Martin and Ms.
    Trinh. It did not go to a decisive or potentially decisive issue in this case.
    Even if believed, Ms. Trinh’s statement to the prosecutor, when taken with the
    other evidence in the trial, could not reasonably be expected to have affected
    the result. The key issues in this case were the DNA evidence, the appellant’s
    explanation for the presence of the semen and the appellant’s relationship to
    the victim. The jury clearly did not find that the appellant’s explanation for
    the presence of his semen raised a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the
    application to admit fresh evidence is denied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
