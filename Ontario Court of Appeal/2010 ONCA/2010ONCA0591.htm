  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was found guilty of assault against his
    wife and son arising from a domestic incident that occurred in their home on
    November 14, 2005. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the finding of guilt, the appellant brought
    an application pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> for a stay of proceedings on the basis that his rights under s. 9 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> were violated both by the delay in bringing him before a justice for a bail
    hearing and because of the operation of a police policy.  That policy was to hold all persons charged
    with domestic assaults until they attended a bail hearing before a judicial
    officer.  The fact that the officer would
    not consider release from custody of persons charged with domestic violence,
    pursuant to s. 498 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    was found by the trial judge to be a systemic abdication of legal
    responsibility by the Durham Regional Police Services.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ruled that the appellant’s rights had
    been violated.  As to remedy, however,
    the trial judge rejected the appellant’s request that a stay be imposed.  Instead, he accepted the appellant’s alternate
    submission and gave the appellant enhanced credit for his 2 days of pre-trial
    custody on a 4 for 1 basis.  As a result,
    the appellant was sentenced to 21 days in custody, to be served intermittently,
    followed by 2 years probation.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On summary conviction appeal, the judge dismissed the
    appeal.  Accordingly, the appellant seeks
    leave to appeal to this court on the basis that the summary conviction appeal
    judge erred in law by upholding the trial judge’s decision to refuse the stay.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appellant has not met the test for
    leave to appeal a decision of a summary conviction appeal judge as set out by
    this court in <i>R. v. R.R.</i> (2008), 90
    O.R. (3d) 641 (Ont. C.A.).<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in this case applied the proper legal
    principles and exercised his discretion to craft a remedy that appropriately
    addressed the circumstances of the breaches and the public and individual
    interests at stake.  The appellant had an
    appeal of the remedy decision.  The
    summary conviction appeal judge gave a detailed review of the remedy, applied
    the appropriate legal principles and found that the trial judge’s decision and
    reasons demonstrated a proper balancing of the seriousness of the breach, the prejudice
    to the appellant and the public interest.  A second level appeal of this fact-specific and discretionary remedy
    decision is not warranted.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In refusing leave, we should not be taken to be
    minimizing the importance of <i>Charter </i>principles
    regarding the granting of pre-trial release.  However, this issue was addressed by the courts below.  Specifically, with respect to the Durham
    Police Services Policy, there was clear recognition that this systemic policy
    led to a serious <i>Charter</i> breach and
    clear judicial denunciation of the practice.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge concluded that the
    denunciation of the Durham Police Services detention practice together with the
    enhanced credit for pre-trial custody properly addressed the seriousness of the
    breach.  The summary conviction appeal
    judge then went on to state that “[<span class=SpellE>i</span>]t is strongly
    urged that the policy of routine detention of those charged with domestic
    violence be immediately terminated.”<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The finding of the breach and the denunciation of the policy
    are not being appealed by the Crown.  The
    leave to appeal sought is limited to a review of the trial judge’s exercise of
    discretion and the choice of remedy for <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 9 <i>Charter </i>breach.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has recently considered the test for a stay
    in the context of bail-related <i>Charter </i>breaches
    in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Zarinchang</span></i> (2010), 99 O.R. (3d) 721 (C.A.).  There
    is no need for further clarification of legal principles. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the leave to appeal application is
    dismissed.<i></i></p>
