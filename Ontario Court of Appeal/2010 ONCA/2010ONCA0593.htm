  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I. Introduction</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a case about two alcoholics, Robert
    Tranchemontagne and Norman Werbeski, who were denied disability benefits under the <i>Ontario Disability Support Program Act,
    1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c. 25, Sched. B (the “ODSPA”), because of their dependence
    on alcohol. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For both men, the impact of their alcoholism was so
    severe that they satisfied the criteria in s. 4 of the ODSPA for being disabled.  However, the Director of the Ontario
    Disability Support Program (“ODSP”) denied the respondents’ applications for
    disability benefits based on s. 5(2) of the ODSPA.  That section disqualifies from eligibility for
    disability benefits one category of disabled people who would otherwise qualify:
    those who are disabled solely because of dependence on alcohol, drugs or some
    other chemically active substance (the “sole impairment group”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the denial was to relegate the
    respondents to applying for welfare under the <i>Ontario Works Act</i>, <i>1997</i>,
    S.O. 1997, c. 25, Sched. A (the “OWA”). At the time of their hearings, this
    meant a difference in benefits to each respondent of $423 per month: Ontario
    Works (“OW”) provided benefits of $536 per month, while the ODSP provided
    benefits of $959 per month. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following an appeal to the Social Benefits Tribunal
    (the “SBT”), the SBT found that s. 5(2) of the ODSPA violates the respondents’
    rights to “equal treatment with respect to services without discrimination
    because of … disability” under s. 1 of the Ontario<i> Human Rights Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 19 (the “Code”) and ordered
    that s. 5(2) of the ODSPA should not be applied to them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SBT concluded that the respondents had established
    a <i>prima facie </i>case of discrimination
    under s. 1 of the Code based on the test set out in <i>Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R.
    497, for establishing a violation of the equality guarantee in s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the SBT rejected the
    Director’s arguments, premised largely on expert social science evidence, that
    the purpose and effect of s. 5(2) is to assist people in the sole impairment
    group to recover from their disease. Instead, the SBT concluded, at p. 17, that
    s. 5(2) “denies income support and imposes restrictions because of assumed or
    unjustly attributed characteristics and therefore denies the essential human
    worth of the [respondents] and those like them and is therefore discriminatory.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director appealed the SBT’s decision to the
    Divisional Court. The Divisional Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the
    SBT did not err in finding that the respondents had established discrimination.
    The Divisional Court also rejected the Director’s argument that the SBT’s
    findings concerning the Director’s social science evidence were not entitled to
    deference on appeal, and, in any event, went on to say that it agreed with the
    SBT’s conclusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in the light of the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    intervening decision in <i>R. v. Kapp</i>,
    [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, the Divisional Court proposed a revised test for
    determining whether a claimant has established a violation of s. 1 of the Code.
    In <i>Kapp</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada
    refocused the test for establishing a breach of the equality guarantee in s. 15
    of the <i>Charter</i> from assessing whether
    there has been a violation of human dignity, as was required by <i>Law</i>, to determining whether the case
    involves discrimination that creates disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice,
    pre-existing disadvantage or stereotyping.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this court, the Director argues that the
    Divisional Court erred in two respects. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, by developing a novel legal test for determining
    whether legislation or a government benefit program is discriminatory under the
    Code that is inconsistent with the s. 15(1) <i>Charter</i> test for discrimination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, by upholding the SBT’s approach to the
    Director’s expert social science evidence. According to the Director, that
    evidence amounted to “legislative fact” evidence. As a result, rather than
    determining which evidence it preferred, the SBT should have determined whether
    the government had a reasonable basis for its legislative policy choice in
    enacting s. 5(2) of the ODSPA -- and if the government did, the SBT should have
    deferred to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that I will explain, I would not adopt the
    post-<i>Kapp</i> test suggested by the
    Divisional Court for establishing a violation under s. 1 of the Code.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, I would dismiss the appeal. Although I
    agree that the Director’s social science evidence was legislative fact
    evidence, I am sceptical that legislative fact evidence attracts deference to
    the government’s policy choice when the issue is whether the legislation is
    discriminatory. In any event, I am not persuaded that the Director’s social
    science evidence is sufficiently cogent to attract deference to the
    government’s policy choice in enacting s. 5(2) of the ODSPA. As the Director
    raised no other basis for challenging the SBT’s decision, the appeal must be
    dismissed.</p>

    under s. 1 of the Code. That issue was litigated all the way to the Supreme
    Court of Canada. Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that the SBT has
    jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to legislation under the Code and
    remitted the matter back to the SBT to determine the issue.  The Supreme Court’s order led to the decision
    under appeal. As the Supreme Court was dealing solely with the question of the
    SBT’s jurisdiction to entertain a challenge under the Code, its decision does
    not govern the issues on this appeal.</p>

    decision concerning the SBT’s jurisdiction to decide challenges to legislation
    under the Code, the Supreme Court of Canada described the two acts as “twin
    components” of the Ontario government's program for delivering social
    assistance.  And the Court noted at para.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is noted in s. 1, the ODSPA provides both income
    supports and employment supports to eligible persons with disabilities.
    Significantly, the ODSPA does not require recipients to seek or maintain
    employment or to participate in work-related activities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to qualify for the ODSP, an individual must

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 4(1) requires that the individual have a

    result in a substantial restriction in one or more of three areas of daily
    living: i) personal care; ii) functioning in the community; or iii) ability to

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although s. 4(1) imposes a one-year timeline for
    eligibility relating to the expected duration of the impairment, it does not
    impose a similar timeline relating to the duration of the “substantial
    restriction”. However, an individual will cease to be eligible for income
    support when no longer “substantially restrict[ed]”. The ODSPA also contains
    mechanisms for reviewing eligibility on an ongoing basis.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    eligibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, s. 5(3) of the ODSPA makes it clear that s.
    5(2) does not apply to individuals with a “substantial physical or mental
    impairment” in addition to substance dependence:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>5. (3) Subsection
    (2) does not apply with respect to a person who, in addition to being dependent
    on or addicted to alcohol, a drug or some other chemically active substance,
    has a substantial physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment
    is caused by the use of alcohol, a drug or some other chemically active
    substance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The combined effect of ss. 5(2) and (3) of the ODSPA is
    therefore to disqualify from eligibility for the ODSP those disabled people
    whose only substantial impairment is solely attributable to substance
    dependence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 31(1) of the ODSPA provides a right to

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The OWA</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like the ODSPA, the OWA sets out the purpose of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OW provides both employment assistance and income
    assistance. Income assistance is provided to persons who satisfy all conditions
    of eligibility under the OWA and the regulations. Generally speaking, these
    conditions require that claimants: satisfy community participation
    requirements; participate in employment assistance activities such as basic
    education and training, literacy training, and treatment for addiction; and
    accept and maintain employment. Recipients who do not comply with these
    requirements may have their assistance reduced, suspended or cancelled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because OW is intended as only a temporary bridge to
    help people get back to work, the program does not provide income support at
    the same levels as the ODSP, which is aimed at assisting people with
    disabilities on a more long-term basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notably, OW employment assistance is not exclusive to

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>d.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Relevant

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the Code provides a guarantee of equal
    treatment with respect to services without discrimination on specified grounds,
    including disability:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1. <i>Every person has a right to equal treatment
    with respect to services</i>, goods and facilities, <i>without discrimination because of</i> race, ancestry, place of origin,
    colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age,
    marital status, family status or <i>disability</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other relevant
    provisions of the Code include: the preamble, which emphasizes the
    importance of recognizing the “inherent dignity ... of all members of the human
    family”; s. 9, which provides that “[n]o
    person shall infringe or do, directly or indirectly, anything that infringes a
    right under this Part”; s. 10, which defines “disability”; and s. 47(1), which makes
    the Code binding on the Crown. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 47(2) gives the Code primacy over other Acts.
    However, that primacy is subject to the government’s right to essentially opt
    out of the Code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notably, unlike the human rights legislation in some
    other provinces, the Code does not include a defence premised on justification.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span> For
    example, s. 8 of the British Columbia <i>Human
    Rights Code</i>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, prohibits discrimination “without a

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>III. The SBT’s Reasons of November 30, 2006</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a preliminary matter, the SBT ruled that its 2001
    decision by a differently constituted panel had determined that both
    respondents met the test for being “a person with a disability” under s. 4(1)
    of the ODSPA. The SBT then turned to the central issue of whether s. 5(2) of
    the ODSPA violates the respondents’ rights under s. 1 of the Code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the respondents were challenging a government
    benefits program, the first question was what test should apply in determining
    that issue. The Director asserted that the test for establishing a violation of
    the equality guarantee under s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i> should apply.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the hearing before the SBT, the s. 15 <i>Charter</i> test was the three-part test set
    out in <i>Law</i> at para. 39: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(1) Does the
    impugned law (a) draw a formal distinction between the claimant and others on
    the basis of one or more personal characteristics, or (b) fail to take into
    account the claimant’s already disadvantaged position within Canadian society,
    resulting in substantively differential treatment between the claimant and
    others on the basis of one or more personal characteristic?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(2) Was the
    claimant subject to differential treatment on the basis of one or more of the
    enumerated or analogous grounds? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(3) Does the
    differential treatment discriminate in a substantive sense?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the third step of the <i>Law</i> test required consideration of the impact of the impugned law
    on the claimant’s human dignity, to be assessed through the lens of four
    contextual factors: (a) pre-existing disadvantage, (b) correspondence between
    the impugned law and the claimant’s actual characteristics or circumstances,
    (c) any ameliorative purpose or effect of the impugned law, and (d) the nature
    and scope of the interest affected: <i>Law</i> at paras. 62-74.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the SBT, the Director argued that the <i>Law </i>test should apply in this case,
    while the respondents argued that the governing test is the <i>prima facie</i> case test for establishing a
    violation of the Code, as set out in<i> Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd.</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
    536 (commonly referred to as “<i>O’Malley</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on this court’s decision in <i>Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Ontario</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 387, in particular, the principle expressed at p. 405 that
    “where two pieces of remedial legislation … share the same purpose, it is
    desirable, in so far as possible [that] they are interpreted in a congruent manner”,
    the SBT concluded that the <i>Law </i>test
    applies to alleged infringements of the equal treatment guarantee set out in s.
    1 of the Code. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, relying on <i>Gwinner
    v. Alberta (Human Resources and Employment)</i>, (2002), 321 A.R. 279 (Q.B.),
    aff’d (2004), 354 A.R. 21 (C.A.),  the
    SBT held that it is not always necessary to apply the elaborate human dignity
    analysis set out in the third step of <i>Law</i> in human rights cases.<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SBT held that the respondents were denied a service
    available to other disabled people because of their particular disability
    (alcohol dependence), thus establishing substantively differential treatment
    between the respondents and others based on a prohibited ground of
    discrimination (steps one and two of <i>Law</i>).
    It was therefore unnecessary that they “establish a violation of human dignity”
    as required under the third step of <i>Law</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly, in reaching this conclusion, the SBT
    rejected the Director’s argument that the purpose and effect of s. 5(2) is to
    assist the disqualified group in recovering from their addictions and that it
    is not therefore discriminatory. However, the SBT cautioned, at p. 11, “that
    each case must be assessed and analyzed on its own merits regarding the
    engagement of the third step scrutiny under the <i>Law</i> test.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Out of an abundance of caution, the SBT then went on to
    consider the third step of <i>Law</i> –
    whether the differential treatment constitutes discrimination in a substantive
    sense because it demeans the human dignity of the claimant – and found that the
    respondents satisfied that step as well. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In essence, the SBT rejected the Director’s arguments
    that the respondents are better served by OW than by the ODSP and concluded
    that s. 5(2) of the ODSPA denies disability benefits to individuals in the sole
    impairment group on the basis of assumed or unjustly attributed
    characteristics, therefore denying them their essential human worth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will return to the SBT’s specific findings in this
    regard later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>IV. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>1. The Divisional Court’s Post-<i>Kapp</i> Test for Establishing a Violation

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            i) The Divisional

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the Divisional Court, the Director argued that
    the SBT was required to apply all three steps of the <i>Law</i> test and, to the extent it purported to apply the four
    contextual factors in the third step, its application of the factors was flawed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court concluded that the answer to
    whether the third step in <i>Law</i> must be
    applied in the human rights context is found in the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    decision in <i>Kapp</i>, which was released
    after the SBT’s ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court observed that, in <i>Kapp</i>, the Supreme Court confirmed that <i>Law</i> did not impose a new and distinctive
    test for discrimination. Rather, <i>Law </i>simply
    affirmed the approach to substantive equality under s. 15 set out in <i>Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia</i>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, which, according to <i>Kapp</i> at para. 17, established the following two-part test for showing discrimination
    under s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does the law create a distinction based on an
    enumerated or analogous ground?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does the distinction create a disadvantage by
    perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <i>Kapp</i> confirmed that the four contextual factors used in step three of <i>Law</i> for assessing whether there has been
    a violation of human dignity are not to be applied as a formulaic test for
    determining substantive inequality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court also noted that, in the Supreme
    Court’s more recent decision in <i>Ermineskin
    Indian Band and Nation v. Canada</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 222, the Court did not
    refer to <i>Law</i>, “human dignity”, or the
    four contextual factors used in step three of <i>Law</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account of these factors, the Divisional Court
    concluded that the SBT did not err in deciding this case based on the first two
    steps in <i>Law</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court then turned to the respondents’
    argument that the <i>Charter</i> test for
    discrimination has wrongly displaced earlier tests developed under the various
    provincial human rights statutes and that <i>Law</i> should not have been applied at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing various decisions that have debated whether
    the <i>Charter</i> test is properly applied
    in the human rights context, the Divisional Court said at para. 102 that
    decisions that have held that the <i>Law</i> test is applicable “must now be viewed in light of the two subsequent decisions
    by the Supreme Court in <i>Kapp </i>and <i>Ermineskin</i>, neither of which require use
    of the more complicated <i>Law</i> test.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, relying on <i>O’Malley</i>, <i>Battlefords and District Cooperative Ltd.
    v. Gibbs</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 21, and <i>Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd</i>., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219, at pp.
    1236-1237, the Divisional Court noted at para. 103 that, “in the human rights
    context, the claimant is only required to put forward a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination, at which point the burden
    shifts to the responding party to demonstrate that either the <i>prima facie</i> case is rebutted or that one
    of the statutory exceptions applies.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in the light of the Supreme Court’s
    “reaffirmation of <i>Andrews</i>” in <i>Kapp</i>, the Divisional Court concluded, at
    para. 104, “it is no longer necessary to apply a human dignity test”. Moreover,
    the Divisional Court opined that the appropriate test in the human rights
    context is “the test established by the Supreme Court in <i>O’Malley</i>, reaffirmed by that court in <i>Meiorin</i> and <i>Grismer</i> …
    informed by <i>Andrews</i>.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account of these principles and conclusions, the
    Divisional Court suggested at para. 105 that post-<i>Kapp</i>, the test for discrimination “[a]dapted for the present human
    rights context, in a case such as this involving the provision of services
    pursuant to a government benefit program,” might read as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1. Has the
    complainant established a <i>prima facie</i> case demonstrating that the service creates a distinction based on a prohibited
    ground under the Human Rights Code?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2. Has the
    respondent established, on a balance of probabilities, that the distinction
    does not create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping?
    Alternatively, has the respondent established a statutory defence under the
    Code?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            ii)The Director’s
    Submissions on Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly in the context of what is effectively a
    challenge to legislation, the Director submits that the test for discrimination
    under the Code should be the same as the test for discrimination under s. 15(1)
    of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying largely on <i>Kapp</i>,
    the Director submits that the Divisional Court’s proposed test improperly
    limits the inquiry in its first step to whether the claimant has established a
    distinction based on a prohibited ground, without requiring proof of a
    disadvantage and, more specifically, without requiring proof of a disadvantage
    that perpetuates prejudice, pre-existing disadvantage or stereotyping. Further,
    the Director contends that the second step improperly places a burden on the
    responding party to disprove substantive discrimination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iii) The Respondents’ Submissions on Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents (and the interveners supporting them)
    acknowledge that step one of the Divisional Court’s test is incorrect to the
    extent that it fails to refer to the requirement for a distinction, based on a
    prohibited ground <i>that creates a
    disadvantage</i>. Beyond that omission, they maintain that the Divisional
    Court’s test is correct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their view, because of the different context of
    human rights cases, there is no need to encumber the test for discrimination
    with complicating concepts about perpetuating prejudice, disadvantage or
    stereotyping. Although human rights codes have been described as fundamental
    law, in the sense that they have an elevated legal status, and are
    quasi-constitutional, they are not constitutional documents and cannot result
    in a law being declared invalid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, because of the wider application of human
    rights codes and their more limited focus, proof of a distinction based on a
    prohibited ground that creates a disadvantage will invariably demonstrate a <i>prima facie</i> case of substantive
    discrimination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although they acknowledge that the Code is aimed at
    eradicating substantive discrimination, the respondents rely on the
    longstanding <i>prima facie</i> case test as
    developed in <i>O’Malley</i>, as being the
    proper test for establishing a violation of the Code.<b>     iv) Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I explain below, I would not adopt the Divisional
    Court’s post-<i>Kapp</i> test for three
    reasons: (1) it overlooks the requirement that the claimant prove disadvantage;
    (2) it implies it is unnecessary for the claimant to show that the disadvantage
    perpetuates prejudice or stereotyping; and (3) it reverses the burden of proof
    by requiring the responding party to rebut a claim of discrimination. I will
    discuss each of my reasons in turn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>a) Discrimination requires disadvantage</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, all parties agree that step one of the
    Divisional Court test overlooked the requirement of proving a distinction based
    on a prohibited ground <i>that creates a
    disadvantage</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I, too, agree that the test for establishing discrimination
    under the Code is consistently expressed in the jurisprudence as requiring a
    distinction based on a prohibited ground that creates a disadvantage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Supreme Court of Canada’s seminal decision in <i>O'Malley</i>, McIntyre J. described
    discrimination (in that case adverse effect discrimination) as follows, at p.
    551:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It arises where an
    employer ... <i>adopts a rule</i> or
    standard ... <i>which has a discriminatory
    effect upon a prohibited ground</i> on one employee or group of employees <i>in that it imposes</i>, because of some
    special characteristic of the employee or group, <i>obligations, penalties, or restrictive conditions not imposed on other
    members</i> of the work force. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Andrews</i> at
    p. 174, McIntyre J. expanded on the concept of disadvantage, albeit in the <i>Charter</i> context, and described it as a
    distinction based on one or more personal characteristics which has the effect
    of “imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group
    not imposed on others, or which withholds or limits access to opportunities,
    benefits, and advantages available to other members of society.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concept of a distinction on a prohibited ground (or
    on an enumerated or analogous ground in the <i>Charter</i> context) <i>that creates a disadvantage</i> is integral to both Code and s. 15 <i>Charter</i> jurisprudence because both are aimed at achieving substantive equality as
    opposed to formal equality. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Formal equality essentially involves ensuring equal
    treatment for those in similar situations and different treatment for those in
    dissimilar situations – it is a concept that involves “treating likes alike”.
    On the other hand, substantive equality recognizes that not all differences in
    treatment are violations of equality rights and that differences in treatment
    are sometimes necessary to achieve true equality: see <i>Andrews </i>at p. 169.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the focus of the discrimination analysis
    is on the effect of the differentiation on the claimant(s), and it is only
    where making a distinction on a prohibited ground has the effect of creating a
    disadvantage that concerns about substantive inequality are engaged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>b) Perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in my opinion, the Divisional Court’s test also
    improperly rejects the notion that, to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination, a claimant must demonstrate a
    distinction on a prohibited ground that creates a disadvantage <i>by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, step one of the Divisional Court’s test
    makes no mention of the claimant’s obligation to prove a distinction based on a
    prohibited ground <i>that creates a
    disadvantage</i>. Rather, step two of the test places an obligation on responding
    parties to prove that the distinction does not create a disadvantage by
    perpetuating stereotyping or prejudice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By framing the test in this way, the Divisional Court
    implied, erroneously in my view, that to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination, it is unnecessary for the
    claimant to demonstrate a distinction based on a prohibited ground that creates
    a disadvantage <i>by perpetuating prejudice
    or stereotyping</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated above, the respondents and some of the
    interveners contend that claimants do not have an obligation, in the human
    rights context, to demonstrate treatment that perpetuates prejudice or
    pre-existing disadvantage or stereotyping, as part of establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this argument.  I can see no principled reason for adopting a
    different meaning for the term discrimination as it appears in s. 1 of the Code
    than has been ascribed to that term in the <i>Charter</i> context. That said, as I will explain, the precise nature of the evidence to be
    led and the stringency of the test to establish discrimination may depend on
    the context. Further, while showing a <i>prima
    facie</i> case of discrimination involves demonstrating a distinction based on
    a prohibited ground that creates a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or
    stereotyping, that does not mean that is a freestanding requirement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, like s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>, s. 1 of the Code involves a guarantee of equal treatment
    in a substantive sense: <i>Brooks</i> at pp.
    1242-1249, and <i>Gibbs</i> at para. 39. And
    proof of <i>discrimination</i> on a
    prohibited ground (or, in the case of the <i>Charter</i>,
    on an enumerated or an analogous ground) is the key to establishing unequal
    treatment in a substantive sense under both provisions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The term “discrimination” is not defined in either s. 1
    of the Code or s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    In the <i>Charter</i> context, the Supreme
    Court of Canada confirmed in <i>Kapp</i> at
    para. 17, that the test to be applied for determining whether discrimination
    exists is the two-step test set out in <i>Andrews</i>:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1. Does the law
    create a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2. Does the
    distinction create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Andrews</i> has
    been referred to with approval consistently in the human rights context since
    it was decided: see, for example, <i>Brooks</i> at p. 1238 and <i>Gibbs</i> at para. 20. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, fundamental differences exist between the <i>Charter</i> and the Code, including
    differences in: the nature of the legislation (constitutional versus
    quasi-constitutional); the scope of the guarantees provided (the <i>Charter</i> contains a broad equality
    guarantee while the Code creates a limited right to be free of discrimination
    in prescribed areas); the circumstances in which the guarantees will apply (the <i>Charter</i> is restricted to government
    conduct while the Code applies to both private and public actors); and, finally,
    the specific exemptions or defences that are available (s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i> contains an absolute prohibition
    against discrimination but s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i> provides a limited defence of justification, while the Code prohibits
    discrimination absolutely but also contains some absolute exemptions and
    defences): see <i>Andrews</i> at pp.
    175-176.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of these differences, the precise nature of the
    evidence to be led and the stringency of the test to be applied to establish
    discrimination may vary and ultimately will depend significantly on the context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the human rights context, in most instances, it will
    be evident that a <i>prima facie</i> case of
    discrimination has been established based solely on the claimant’s evidence
    showing a distinction based on a prohibited ground that creates a disadvantage
    (in the sense of withholding a benefit available to others or imposing a burden
    not imposed on others). An inference of stereotyping or of perpetuating
    disadvantage or prejudice will generally arise based on that evidence alone. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in other instances a more nuanced inquiry may
    be necessary to properly assess whether a distinction based on an enumerated
    ground that creates a disadvantage actually engages the right to equal
    treatment under the Code in a substantive sense.</p>

    dismissed an employee in accordance with the terms of a collective agreement after
    she had been absent from work on disability for more than three years. The
    majority of the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the dismissal based on the
    arbitrator’s finding that the employer had sufficiently accommodated the
    employee. However, Abella J., concurring in the result, relied on the
    arbitrator’s finding that the employee failed to establish a <i>prima facie</i>&nbsp;case
    of discrimination. In doing so, she observed that not every distinction that
    creates a disadvantage is discriminatory:</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black;'>[48]  At the heart of these definitions is the understanding that a
    workplace practice, standard, or requirement cannot disadvantage an individual
    by attributing stereotypical or arbitrary characteristics. The goal of
    preventing discriminatory barriers is inclusion. It is achieved by preventing
    the exclusion of individuals from opportunities and amenities that are based
    not on their actual abilities, but on attributed ones. <i>The essence of the discrimination is in the arbitrariness of its
    negative impact, that is, the arbitrariness of the barriers imposed, whether
    intentionally or unwittingly</i>.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black;'>[49]  What flows from this is that there is a difference between
    discrimination and a distinction. <i>Not
    every distinction is discriminatory. It is not enough to impugn an employer's
    conduct on the basis that what was done had a negative impact on an individual
    in a protected group.</i> Such membership alone does not, without more,
    guarantee access to a human rights remedy. <i>It
    is the link between that group membership and the arbitrariness of the
    disadvantaging criterion or conduct, either on its face or in its impact, that
    triggers the possibility of a remedy</i>. And it is the claimant who bears this
    threshold burden.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black;'>[50]  If such a link is made, a&nbsp;<i>prima facie</i>&nbsp;case of
    discrimination has been shown. It is at this stage that the&nbsp;<i>Meiorin</i>&nbsp;test

    Court of Appeal endorsed a three-part test used by an adjudicator for
    determining whether a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination had been established. That test does not make specific
    reference to the requirement of demonstrating a distinction that creates a

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Tysoe J.A. rejected the argument that there
    is now a separate requirement to show that the adverse treatment was based on
    arbitrariness or stereotypical presumptions. Rather, he concluded at para. 27 that
    “the goal of protecting people from arbitrary or stereotypical treatment is
    incorporated in this third element of the <i>prima
    facie</i> test” as expressed by the adjudicator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So long as it is understood that the <i>prima facie</i> case test involves
    establishing substantive discrimination and that demonstrating a distinction
    that creates a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping is the
    foundation of substantive discrimination, in my view, that is sufficient. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in my opinion, the goal of protecting people
    from arbitrary or stereotypical treatment or treatment that creates
    disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice is actually incorporated into two stages
    of the <i>prima facie</i> case analysis: i)
    determining whether the treatment in issue truly creates a disadvantage; and
    ii) determining whether the protected ground or characteristic truly played a
    role in creating the disadvantage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Armstrong</i>,
    the essence of the respondent’s position was that the protected characteristic
    (gender) did not play a role in causing the adverse treatment. Put another way,
    the respondent claimed that the decision not to fund was not based on an
    irrelevant personal characteristic. Tysoe J.A. concluded that the goal of
    protecting people from arbitrary or stereotypical treatment was incorporated into
    determining whether a distinction based on a prohibited ground <i>truly played a role</i> in creating the
    disadvantage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the essence of the Director’s position is
    that s. 5(2) of the ODSPA does not create a <i>true</i> disadvantage. Put another way, the Director asserts that s. 5(2) directs the
    respondents to OW, a program better suited to their needs, and therefore does
    not create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping. The SBT
    found the opposite when it concluded that s. 5(2) “denies income support and
    imposes restrictions because of assumed or unjustly attributed characteristics.”
    I agree with the SBT’s conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Director’s argument and the SBT’s
    conclusion demonstrate that the goal of protecting people from discriminatory
    conduct is also incorporated into determining whether a distinction based on a
    prohibited ground creates a true disadvantage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>                        c) The
    burden of proving discrimination always rests with the claimant</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third reason why I would not adopt the Divisional
    Court’s test is that, in my opinion, step two of that test reverses the burden
    of proof by requiring a responding party to effectively disprove discrimination
    on a balance of probabilities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the responding party in a human rights
    case has the onus of establishing statutory defences on a balance of
    probabilities. But I do not agree that a responding party must ever disprove
    discrimination on a balance of probabilities. Rather, in my opinion, the onus
    of proving discrimination on a balance of probabilities remains on the claimant
    throughout. If a claimant proves discrimination on a balance of probabilities
    and the responding party fails to prove a statutory defence or exemption, then
    the claimant will have proved a violation of the Code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>prima facie</i> case test was established in <i>O’Malley</i>.
    However, it is important to remember that <i>O’Malley</i> was a case in which an employee alleged adverse effect discrimination after her
    employer adopted a rule requiring all full-time employees to work on Saturdays
    and the employee declined to do so for religious reasons. The employer did not
    call evidence, and the issue for the Court was who should bear the onus of
    demonstrating whether the employer acted reasonably in its efforts to
    accommodate the employee. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McIntyre J., speaking for the Supreme Court of Canada,
    concluded that the employer should bear the burden. In doing so, at p. 558 he
    referred to the decision in <i>Ontario Human
    Rights Commission v. Etobicoke</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, in which the rule was
    established that, in cases involving direct discrimination against an employee,
    the onus falls on the employer to “justify” a discriminatory rule:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It was held in [<i>Etobicoke</i>] that at least in direct
    discrimination cases, <i>where the
    complainant has shown a&nbsp;prima
    facie&nbsp;case of discrimination on a prohibited ground, the onus falls
    on the employer to justify if he can the discriminatory rule on a balance of
    probabilities</i>. The question then is whether this rule should apply in cases
    of adverse effect discrimination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='

'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='color:black;'>Therefore,
    under the&nbsp;<i>Etobicoke</i>&nbsp;rule as to burden of proof, the showing of
    a&nbsp;<i>prima facie</i>&nbsp;case of discrimination, I see no reason why it
    should not apply in cases of adverse effect discrimination. The complainant in
    proceedings before human rights tribunals must show a <i>prima facie</i>&nbsp;case
    of discrimination. <i>A&nbsp;prima facie&nbsp;case in this context
    is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is
    complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the
    absence of an answer from the respondent-employer</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, neither the rule in <i>O’Malley</i> nor the rule in <i>Etobicoke</i> stand for the proposition that the responding party must <i>disprove</i> discrimination on a balance of probabilities. Rather, they
    stand for the proposition that a responding party must prove defences and
    exemptions, such as reasonable accommodation and justification, on a balance of
    probabilities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in my opinion, neither <i>Gibbs</i> nor <i>Brooks</i> squarely
    address the issue of the burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find support for my conclusion that the Divisional
    Court’s test reverses the burden of proof in <i>Armstrong</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that case, the adjudicator found that gender was not
    a factor in the Ministry’s decision not to pay for PSA screening tests because
    he found, based on a consideration of the whole of the evidence, including
    evidence led by the respondent, that it had not been established that PSA tests
    were medically effective as a cancer screening tool.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The adjudicator stated, “Mr. Armstrong has not met the <i>prima facie</i> test because he has not
    established that the Ministry made a distinction on a prohibited ground ...
    therefore, the onus has not shifted to the Ministry to provide a reasonable
    justification for its policy”: <i>Armstrong</i> at para. 12. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    upheld the adjudicator’s decision because Mr. Armstrong had not established the
    necessary nexus between the protected ground (gender) and the adverse
    treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note as well that in <i>British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v.
    British Columbia Government and Service Employees’ Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.)
    (Meiorin Grievance)</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court of Canada held
    that Ms. Meiorin had discharged the burden of establishing that an aerobic
    standard was <i>prima facie</i> discriminatory by showing that most women could not meet the standard. In
    reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the arbitrator
    rejected the evidence of the government’s expert witness that most women could
    achieve the aerobic standard with training.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, although an evidentiary burden to rebut
    discrimination may shift to the responding party once the claimant has led
    sufficient evidence, if believed, to support a finding of discrimination in the
    absence of an answer from the responding party, the onus of proving
    discrimination remains on the claimant throughout.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Two final
    comments. First, I am inclined to think that the respondents led sufficient
    evidence to support a finding of discrimination had their claim of
    discrimination remained unanswered merely by showing that they were deprived of
    the same level of income support available to other disabled claimants based on
    the nature of their disability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-known that addicts and welfare recipients
    have been, and continue to be, the subjects of stigma and prejudice. Moreover,
    an examination of the legislative scheme of the ODSPA and the OWA fails to
    reveal any obvious explanation for why the sole impairment group was excluded
    from ODSP benefits. In my view, these factors were sufficient to create an
    inference that s. 5(2) of the ODSPA discriminates against the respondents by
    perpetuating prejudice and disadvantage and by stereotyping through depriving
    the respondents of the benefits available to other disabled people because of
    their specific disability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, once the Director led evidence attempting to
    rebut the respondents’ claim of discrimination, the SBT had to determine
    whether the respondents established their claim based on the whole of the
    evidence adduced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second, I
    observe that the SBT explained its reasons for rejecting the Director’s
    evidence using the full <i>Law</i> framework, and that its reasons are entirely consistent with <i>Kapp</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In essence, the SBT concluded that OW is actually less
    suited to the respondents’ needs than the ODSP because: (1) the respondents’
    financial needs are more likely to be long-term rather than short-term; (2) the
    ODSP has a mechanism for ensuring support money is not spent on alcohol; and (3)
    the ODSP offers most of the same employment supports as OW. Equally, if not
    more important, the SBT concluded that, unlike OW, the ODSP did not place the
    respondents at risk of losing their benefits if they were unable, because of
    their disability, to comply with OW’s mandatory participation requirements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the SBT stated at p. 17 that s. 5(2) “denies
    income support and imposes restrictions because of assumed or unjustly attributed
    characteristics and therefore denies the essential human worth of the
    [respondents] and those like them”. At its core, this is a finding that s. 5(2)
    of the ODSP creates a disadvantage by stereotyping.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, based on the evidence of the respondents’
    experts, the SBT found that addiction is a disability that carries with it
    great social stigma and that this stigmatization is compounded where an
    addicted person is also part of another stigmatized group, such as those on
    social assistance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the end of the day, although the SBT did not have
    the benefit of <i>Kapp</i>, in my view, its
    reasons fall squarely within <i>Kapp</i>,
    and I see no basis for interfering with its decision based on the precise test
    it used to analyze the issues before it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>2.  The SBT did not err in its Approach to the Expert Social Science
    Evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            i)
    The Director’s Social Science Evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I accept the Director’s argument that the
    Divisional Court’s post-<i>Kapp</i> test is
    not correct, counsel for the Director fairly conceded in oral argument that in
    order to succeed on this appeal the Director must also demonstrate legal error
    in the SBT’s analysis of s. 5(2) of the ODSPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of its claim that the SBT erred in finding
    that s. 5(2) of the ODSPA is discriminatory, the Director relied primarily on
    the evidence of Dr. William Jacyk, a physician specializing in addictions at
    the Homewood Health Centre. The essence of Dr. Jacyk’s opinion was that
    disqualifying persons whose sole impairment is substance dependence from
    eligibility for the ODSP, but leaving them potentially eligible for OW, is
    appropriate from a medical perspective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Dr. Jacyk, substance dependence is a
    disease characterized by a progression in which the individual increasingly
    loses autonomy and control over the use and consequences of use of the
    substance. Although he describes substance dependence as “a chronic relapsing
    disorder”, he maintains that it is “a totally treatable disease” and that the
    chronic relapsing nature of the condition “is a result of non-compliance with
    ongoing treatment rather than ... a disease process that is progressive and
    totally uncontrollable.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From Dr. Jacyk’s perspective, a key distinction exists
    between persons with simple or “uncomplicated” addictions, and those who suffer
    from additional mental health or physical conditions, which he called “concurrent
    disorders”. In his view, all persons with uncomplicated addictions are capable
    of recovery. Moreover, with this group, there is an expectation of a timely
    return to work and “long-term disability is not a consideration”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Dr. Jacyk’s opinion, although a variety of
    treatments are available, all successful treatments are based on the promotion
    of personal responsibility, accountability and self-esteem. Key factors in
    assisting recovery are providing external motivators that promote feelings of
    self-esteem and self-worth (for example, an early return to the workforce) and
    avoiding negative influences and enablers that inhibit internal motivation to
    change (for example, third parties paying off debts or providing loans or
    handouts when disposable funds have been spent on drugs or alcohol).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Dr. Jacyk, for individuals in the sole
    impairment group, disqualifying them from eligibility for the ODSP promotes
    their recovery in four ways: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it removes a financial disincentive to recovery
    (enhanced ongoing benefits through ODSP eligibility); </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it avoids promoting a spirit of long-term
    infirmity (through participation in a plan that implies that they have less
    potential to recover than they in fact have);  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it limits the money they have available to spend
    on alcohol or drugs; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it directs them to OW, a program that promotes
    accountability, self-sufficiency and self-esteem by requiring that claimants
    participate in employment assistance activities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Dr. Jacyk opined that, depending on
    the degree of impairment, the ODSP may be the appropriate program for people
    with a concurrent disorder. Despite treatment, such individuals may relapse and
    progress further into their illness. They may therefore require a greater
    concentration of energy on treatment and recovery, accompanied by relief from
    their everyday responsibilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            ii) The SBT’s Decision
    of November 30, 2006</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of this issue, the SBT’s crucial determination
    is its decision to reject the Director’s argument that the respondents are
    better served by OW than by the ODSP. This argument rested primarily on Dr.
    Jacyk’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the Director’s position, the SBT concluded
    that s. 5(2) is not closely tailored to the actual needs of persons in the sole
    impairment group but rather denies disability benefits for individuals in the
    group on the basis of assumed or unjustly attributed characteristics, denying
    them their essential human worth. In making this finding, the SBT essentially
    rejected the key elements of Dr. Jacyk’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            iii)
    The Director’s Position on Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the Divisional Court, the Director argued that
    the SBT’s findings of fact were not entitled to appellate deference because the
    social science evidence was legislative fact evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this court, the Director recasts its
    argument concerning legislative fact/social fact evidence. In addition to
    arguing that the SBT's findings of legislative fact are not entitled to appellate
    deference, the Director now submits for the first time that the SBT erred in
    failing to consider whether the government had a reasonable basis for the
    legislative policy choice reflected in s. 5(2) of the ODSPA, and if the
    government did, in failing to defer to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director contends that the SBT failed to appreciate
    the distinction between “legislative fact” and “adjudicative fact” evidence and
    therefore erred in its approach to the expert evidence that was before it.
    Relying on <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, the Director submits that the
    Supreme Court of Canada has held that the legislature is entitled to a measure
    of deference with respect to issues of public policy where a law is premised on
    complex and conflicting expert evidence and allocates scarce public resources.
    Where such factors are present, the Director argues, the government is entitled
    to a margin of appreciation in formulating policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director submits that the expert evidence before the
    SBT was directed at how various treatment options and social assistance
    structures would affect the behaviour of persons with addictions. The Director
    claims that these are matters not susceptible of empirical proof and about
    which there is no expert consensus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the Director contends that its expert, Dr.
    Jacyk, was the only expert who gave expert evidence on the characteristics and
    needs of the sole impairment group - the only group ineligible under s. 5(2) -
    and the only expert who compared the circumstances of the sole impairment group
    to the larger group of disabled persons with other or additional impairments.
    Dr. Jacyk was also the only expert familiar with the operation of both the
    ODSPA and the OWA and also the only witness to testify to his experience
    treating patients affected by s. 5(2) or similar provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Director submits that the Divisional Court
    erred in law in failing to apply the appropriate standard of appellate review
    to the SBT’s findings of legislative fact. Here, the Director reiterates its
    argument made in the Divisional Court that the SBT's findings of legislative
    fact are not entitled to appellate deference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iv) Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I accept the Director’s submission that Dr.
    Jacyk’s evidence opining that OW represents a better fit for the sole
    impairment group than the ODSP falls into the category of legislative fact
    evidence, I am not persuaded that the SBT made any error in rejecting the
    Director’s arguments that were premised on Dr. Jacyk’s opinion. </p>

    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086, at p. 1099, the Supreme Court described adjudicative
    facts as “those that concern the immediate parties ... who did what, where,
    when, how and with what motive or intent”, whereas legislative facts “are those
    that establish the purpose and background of legislation, including its social,
    economic and cultural context.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in <i>RJR-MacDonald</i> at para. 79, La Forest J. observed that “social” or “legislative” facts are
    those “<i>that</i> arise in the law-making
    process and <i>require the </i>legislature
    or <i>court to assess complex social science
    evidence and to draw general conclusions concerning the effect of legal rules
    on human behaviour</i>”<i> </i>(emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that Dr. Jacyk provided expert opinion evidence
    concerning the relative impact of OW and the ODSP on the sole impairment group,
    it seems to me that his evidence is properly classified as legislative fact
    evidence. As such, I accept the Director’s argument that the SBT’s assessment
    of this evidence may attract less than the usual degree of appellate deference: <i>RJR-McDonald</i> at paras. 79-81 and 141.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, particularly in the light of my view of this
    evidence, as well as the fact that the Director’s right of appeal is limited to
    questions of law, ultimately this factor matters very little in the
    circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I note that even if I am wrong in concluding

    the Director and would still result in the appeal being dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the SBT explained its reasons for

    Jacyk’s evidence is legislative fact evidence and that the SBT erred in its

    that, at least in some circumstances, courts are instructed to accord the
    legislature a wide measure of deference in relation to its policy choices. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>RJR-MacDonald, </i>La Forest J. held, at para. 77, that in the context of a s. 1 <i>Charter </i>analysis, the government need
    only prove that it had a “rational basis” for enacting legislation aimed at the
    broader social good. Similarly, in <i>McKinney
    v. University of Guelph</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 305, again in relation
    to a s. 1 <i>Charter </i>analysis, La Forest
    J. stated that the “operative question” in such cases is whether the government
    had a “reasonable basis, on the evidence tendered for concluding that the
    legislation interferes as little as possible with a guaranteed right, given the
    government’s pressing and substantial objectives.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court summarized the prevailing view in <i>Wynberg v. Ontario</i> (2006), 82 O.R. (3d)
    561, at para. 184, also in the context of a s. 1 <i>Charter </i>analysis:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court of Canada has held repeatedly
    that where the government has made a difficult policy choice regarding the
    claims of competing groups, or the evaluation of complex and conflicting
    research, or the distribution of public resources, or the promulgation of
    solutions which concurrently balance benefits and costs for many different
    parties, then the proper course of judicial conduct is deference.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Dr. Jacyk’s evidence did not relate to a s. 1 <i>Charter</i> issue in the sense that it
    sought to justify a discriminatory policy. Rather, it related to the Director’s
    attempt to rebut the respondent’s claim of discrimination through the argument that
    OW was better suited to the respondents’ needs than the ODSP. Before the SBT,
    this argument was premised on the second contextual factor set out in <i>Law</i>: the extent to which s. 5(2) of the
    ODSPA corresponds with the actual needs, capacity or circumstances of the sole
    impairment group. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it is true that a law with a discriminatory
    purpose will be invalid, it is also true that a law that has a discriminatory effect
    will not be saved by a benevolent purpose: <i>Andrews</i> at p. 167. In the result, the primary inquiry when addressing the second
    contextual factor set out in <i>Law</i> is
    not about the basis for the government’s legislative policy choice; rather, it
    is about legislative impact. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director acknowledges that this is not a case about
    under-inclusive legislation requiring the government to make a choice about
    allocating scarce resources. On the contrary, the Director submits that s. 5(2)
    is not discriminatory because both its purpose and its effect are to assist the
    sole impairment group with their recovery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, although the legislature will be afforded
    a margin of appreciation in the sense that perfect correspondence is not
    required (see <i>Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General), </i>[2002] 4 S.C.R. 429,
    at para. 55), the primary inquiry remains the extent to which s. 5(2)
    corresponds with the actual needs, capacity or circumstances of the respondents
    and other members of the sole impairment group. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the fact that the government may be able
    to provide a basis for its policy choice should not determine the fundamental
    question of whether s. 5(2) in fact has a discriminatory effect on the
    respondents. Rather, it is up to the tribunals and courts who are tasked with
    determining whether a legislative provision is discriminatory to make the
    necessary findings based on their assessment of the whole of the evidence
    before them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that the authorities on which the
    Director relies hold otherwise. In the main, they are <i>Charter </i>cases addressing the s. 1 analysis or situations involving
    under-inclusive legislation: <i>RJR-MacDonald</i>;<i> McKinney</i>; <i>Wynberg</i>; <i>Canada (Attorney
    General) v. JTI-McDonald Corp.</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610; <i>Newfoundland (Treasury Board) v. Newfoundland and Labrador Assn. of
    Public and Private Employees, (N.A.P.E.)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 381; <i>R. v. Irwin Toy</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927; <i>PSAC v. Canada, </i>[1987] 1 S.C.R. 424; and <i>Harper v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, I am sceptical that the SBT was required to
    approach the expert social science evidence in this case on the basis of
    assessing whether the government had some basis for its legislative policy
    choice in enacting s. 5(2) of the ODSPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Dr. Jacyk’s
    Evidence is not Sufficiently Cogent to Attract Deference</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that Dr. Jacyk’s evidence is capable of
    supporting some measure of deference for the government’s policy choice in
    enacting s. 5(2) of the ODSPA, I am not satisfied that the SBT erred in
    rejecting his evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, Dr. Jacyk’s evidence is not sufficiently
    cogent to attract deference to the government’s policy choice.  I say this for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I reject the Director’s submission that Dr.
    Jacyk’s evidence reflected familiarity with OW and the ODSP and how the
    disqualification in s. 5(2) of the ODSPA operates. In my opinion, the
    cross-examination on his affidavit demonstrates otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge that Dr. Jacyk said on cross-examination that he had reviewed
    Ontario’s social assistance legislation and that he sees patients who receive
    support under both regimes. However, he was unable to recall a specific
    occasion on which he had dealt with the legislation in his own practice and
    acknowledged that he had never been asked to assess whether a particular
    patient was disabled under the ODSPA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Jacyk was unable to comment on whether he had
    increased success in dealing with OW patients versus ODSP patients. Further, he
    described the objectives of the two regimes, incorrectly in my view, as
    “mak[ing] sure that people have social assistance so that they don’t starve and
    have an opportunity to make some assessment as to where they can go next.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When asked if he had any understanding of what the
    consequences might be for non-compliance with OW’s mandatory participation
    requirements, Dr. Jacyk said no.   When asked if he was familiar with s. 5(2) of
    the ODSPA, Dr. Jacyk said he would have to refresh his memory. When asked if he
    was aware that the ODSPA allows for representative payees of the social
    assistance, Dr. Jacyk said no.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Dr. Jacyk was able to refresh his memory
    concerning at least some of these matters, he can hardly be described as an
    expert who has a working familiarity with Ontario’s social assistance regime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, and more fundamentally, in my opinion, Dr.
    Jacyk’s evidence did not relate his theories about addiction to the terminology
    and classifications in the ODSPA in a manner that would support deference for
    the government’s policy choice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 5(2) of the ODSPA disqualifies from
    eligibility for ODSP those individuals who meet the definition of being a
    person with disability because they are dependent on alcohol, drugs or some
    other chemically active substance. Subsection 5(3) of the ODSPA clarifies that
    s. 5(2) does not apply to people with a “substantial physical or mental
    impairment” in addition to substance dependence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The combined effect of these two sections is to
    restrict the disqualification from eligibility for benefits to people who meet
    the definition of being a person with a disability but whose sole impairment is
    attributable to substance dependence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, at its core, Dr. Jacyk’s evidence rejects the
    possibility that people in the sole impairment group can be disabled. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout the course of his evidence, Dr. Jacyk made
    broad statements about the characteristics of people with simple addictions,
    compared them with addicts whose addictions are complicated by concurrent
    disorders, and said that, in contrast to addicts with concurrent disorders,
    people with simple addictions are entirely treatable and unlikely to relapse.
    Dr. Jacyk expressly rejected in his evidence the notion that people with simple
    addictions can be disabled. However, in opining that s. 5(2) of the ODSPA is
    medically appropriate, Dr. Jacyk effectively equated the category of people he
    described as having simple addictions with the category of persons created by
    the ODSPA as the sole group impairment group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly, Dr. Jacyk never addressed in his
    evidence the pivotal issue of whether the category of people he describes as having
    simple addictions are properly equated with the sole group impairment group
    created by the ODSPA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, Dr. Jacyk:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>never addressed in his evidence how it is that a
    person in the sole impairment group can meet the definition of being a person
    with a disability under the ODSPA if they suffer from nothing more than what he
    describes as a simple addiction;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>never described the sequelae and impacts of
    addiction a person in the sole impairment group who meets the definition of
    being a person with a disability is likely to have experienced and how such a
    person will be excluded from his description of an addict with a concurrent
    disorder; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>never provided an opinion concerning the
    likelihood of a person in the sole impairment group, who meets the definition
    of being a person with a disability, being able to comply with the mandatory OW
    participation requirements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What follows are two excerpts from Dr. Jacyk’s
    testimony on cross-examination that illustrate these points (for additional
    excerpts see Appendix B):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. So it’s your view
    that unless a substance dependent person has a co-occurring disorder they would
    not be disabled?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. That’s correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. In your view can
    substance dependence with no complications result in disability for the
    purposes of the ODSPA?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. Without complications?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. I do not believe
    it can.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, Dr. Jacyk noted in his cross-examination
    that it may not be possible to diagnose a concurrent disorder until after
    treatment for substance dependence has begun. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Dr. Jacyk never addressed in his evidence the
    likelihood that people who fall into the sole impairment group under the ODSPA
    could be people he described as having a concurrent disorder, but who have not
    yet been diagnosed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that Dr. Jacyk does not have a working
    familiarity with the Ontario social assistance regime and has never assessed
    whether a particular patient is disabled under the ODSPA, it may be
    questionable whether he could even proffer such an opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reality of this case is that Mr. Tranchemontagne
    and Mr. Werbeski are classified under the ODSPA as being persons with a
    disability whose only substantial impairment is attributable to substance
    dependence. The Director has not raised any challenge to the SBT’s finding that
    they are disabled. And Dr. Jacyk’s evidence simply does not acknowledge or
    address their circumstances. Indeed, he acknowledged on cross-examination that
    he did not know either Mr. Tranchemontagne or Mr. Werbeski and did not know
    whether they were disabled within the meaning of the ODSPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the Director’s argument that s. 5(2) of the
    ODSPA is not discriminatory was premised largely on Dr. Jacyk’s evidence, in my
    view, the SBT was entirely justified in rejecting the Director’s argument and
    in holding, at p. 17, that s. 5(2) “denies income support and imposes
    restrictions because of assumed or unjustly attributed characteristics ... and
    is therefore discriminatory.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the SBT did not frame its assessment of Dr.
    Jacyk’s evidence in precisely the same way as I have, it is apparent that the
    SBT simply did not accept his unsubstantiated assertion that the category of
    people he described as having simple addictions would correspond even in a
    general way with the category of people who fall into the sole impairment group
    under the ODSPA. Nor does it appear that the SBT was satisfied that Dr. Jacyk
    had a working familiarity with the ODSPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the SBT found that a claim for financial
    assistance by a person in the sole impairment group was “far more likely to be
    long-term”;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the SBT determined that the risk of cancellation
    of benefits under OW for failing to comply with the mandatory participation
    requirements is a real risk for addicts; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the SBT rejected the Director’s argument that
    receipt of less financial assistance is actually beneficial at least in part
    because of the mechanism for appointing a trustee to manage a recipient’s money
    under the ODSPA – a mechanism that Dr. Jacyk said he was not aware of.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the
    Director has demonstrated that the SBT erred in its approach to the expert
    social science evidence or that the Divisional Court erred in its review of the
    SBT’s approach.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based

    dignity and worth of every person and to provide for equal rights and
    opportunities without discrimination that is contrary to law, and having as its
    aim the creation of a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the

Appendix       ‘B’</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Is it your view
    that not all substance dependent persons are disabled?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. And that some
    are disabled? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. Well the ones that
    are complicated, yes...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. So it’s your
    view that unless a substance dependent person has a co-occurring disorder they
    would not be disabled?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. That’s correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Is it your view
    that there is no severe addiction in the absence of a concurrent disorder?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. I’m really
    trying to just go through my experience it’s a really important question and
    [I’m] basically trying to recall in my clinical experience have I ever run into
    somebody who was severe without something complicating their addiction and
    quite frankly from my clinical experience I haven’t run across that...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. And so you also
    have not run across anybody who was disabled by their dependence without
    something complicating his dependence?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. That’s correct.
    I’ve run across a lot of people with disabilities ... but they were
    complicated...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.  [T]he proposition to the witness is that in
    substance dependence the disease may override any motivational aspects of the
    person’s intention to change and I take it that Dr. Jacyk disagreed with that
    to the extent that it would be attributed solely to substance dependence and in
    Dr. Jacyk’s view that phenomenon would require a concurrent disorder. Am I
    being fair so far?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. That’s
    correct...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. In your view can
    substance dependence with no complications result in disability for the
    purposes of the ODSPA?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. Without
    complications?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. I do not believe
    it can.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Recommendation
    40 is that the City of Toronto urged the Provincial government to reinstate
    addiction as an eligible disability under the Ontario Disability Support
    Program. I take it you disagree with that recommendation?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. The way it’s
    stated, yes ... in my opinion addiction per se should not be considered a
    disability. It can lead to disability if it’s added to other circumstances. I
    have no problem with that, but to say that the addiction is a disability in its
    own right to me is like saying allergies are a disability and should be added
    to the ODSP. It’s too broad a term ... it may lead to disability when it
    becomes complicated, yes. I’ve already said that several times...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Do take issue
    with anything that Dr. Berger says in that paragraph?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. I have a concern
    as to still stat[ing] that ... one aspect of substance dependence is that by
    its nature [it] is a relapsing disorder. As I am ... getting to understand it,
    it may not be as relapsing as we think because we never took into account that
    there were other factors, there were mental health issues or physical issues
    that may be contributing to the relapsing ...</p>

    it would be unnecessary in many human rights cases to engage in “the elaborate
    third step scrutiny to determine if the dignity interest of the Claimant is
    truly engaged”. The court in <i>Gwinner</i> also relied on statements by the Supreme Court of Canada to the effect that
    distinctions made on enumerated grounds will rarely escape a finding of
    discrimination, as well as the fact that many human rights tribunals had
    resisted the necessity of showing a violation of human dignity as part of
    establishing a <i>prima facie </i>case of
    discrimination under human rights legislation. On the facts of this case, the
    SBT concluded that the respondents had established a <i>prima facie </i>case of discrimination based on the first two steps of <i>Law</i>.</span></p>
