  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 29, 1995, the appellant Lorne Taylor attended a
    party held by Bobby Allard and Joyce Allen at their residence in East
    Gwillimbury. They rented the property from the respondent Robert Allen, Joyce
    Allen’s son. The respondent did not live on the property, nor did he attend the
    party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial judge, the rental agreement
    provided that, as tenants, they “would reside on the property and pay all of
    the costs therein in lieu of rent”. The appellant acknowledges that the trial
    judge appears to have meant that the rental agreement unburdened the landlord
    of any maintenance obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime earlier, the respondent had built a fire pit
    at the rear of the property, ringed with partially submerged cinder blocks. The
    evening of the party, a substantial fire was built in the fire pit, supervised
    by Mr. Allard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, who had been drinking for a good part of
    the day, arrived at the party late in the evening in a drunken condition. He
    joined the guests around the bonfire. He testified that about half an hour
    after his arrival, two women started fighting, causing him to start backing up.
    He tripped over the cinder blocks, fell into the fire pit, and was badly
    burned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sued the tenants and the landlord, the
    respondent Robert Allen, for the injuries he suffered. At trial his damages
    were assessed at $265,000. That amount is not at issue in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that, for the purposes of the <i>Occupiers’ Liability Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c.
    O.2 (the OLA), the cinder blocks ringing the fire pit could constitute a
    danger. At para. 41 of his reasons, he concluded that “at the time of the
    incident, the bonfire itself had allowed itself to be extinguished thereby
    leaving a very hot unlit area, surrounded by cinder blocks that could trip such
    [a] person as the plaintiff.” These findings are not contested in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found the tenants to be occupiers of
    the premises for the purposes of the OLA.  Pursuant to s. 3 of the OLA, they were therefore responsible to the
    appellant for permitting the danger that caused him to trip and fall into the
    fire pit. The trial judge held them liable for 50% of the damages suffered by
    the appellant, which he split equally between both tenants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found the appellant to be 50% at
    fault for his own damages, a finding the appellant does not contest in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge held that the respondent
    landlord owed no duty of care to the appellant, and dismissed the action
    against him. The trial judge found that the respondent had no control over the
    premises, had no say in the operation of the property, and no control over the
    party, the guest list, or whether the fire was built that night. He concluded
    that in the circumstances the respondent owed no duty of care to the appellant.
    His reasoning is set out in full at paras. 35 and 36 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[35] In the circumstances, I find that section 8 of
    the <i>Occupiers’ Liability Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. O.2 provides a liability of the landlord to a guest of a tenant only
    if there is an actionable claim by the tenant, this defendant’s co-defendants
    against the landlord.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Kim v.
    Thammayong </i>2007 CanLII 52791</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Perez v. Roca
    et al </i>2003 CanLII 35998.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[36] In the circumstances, I find that the
    defendant, Robert James Allen, owed no duty to the plaintiff Taylor and that
    the action against him should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasoning appears to begin with the
    finding that the respondent had no control over the premises, and since he was
    not in physical possession of the premises either, he did not meet the
    definition of “occupier” in s. 1 of the OLA and therefore had no duty of care
    to the appellant under s. 3 of the OLA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to s. 8 of the OLA which
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Obligations
    of landlord as occupier</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P64_6685"></a><a name=s8s1></a><b>8. </b>(1)
    Where premises are occupied or used by virtue of a tenancy under which the
    landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair of the premises, it is
    the duty of the landlord to show towards any person or the property brought on
    the premises by those persons, the same duty of care in respect of dangers
    arising from any failure on the landlord’s part in carrying out the landlord’s
    responsibility as is required by this Act to be shown by an occupier of the
    premises.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Idem</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P66_7168"></a><a name=s8s2></a>(2) For the
    purposes of this section, a landlord shall not be deemed to have made default
    in carrying out any obligation to a person unless the landlord’s default is
    such as to be actionable at the suit of the person entitled to possession of
    the premises.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Definitions</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P68_7436"></a><a name=s8s3></a>(3) For the
    purposes of this section, obligations imposed by any enactment by virtue of a
    tenancy shall be treated as imposed by the tenancy, and “tenancy” includes a
    statutory tenancy, an implied tenancy and any contract conferring the right of
    occupation, and “landlord” shall be construed accordingly.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Application
    of section</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P70_7769"></a><a name=s8s4></a>(4) This
    section applies to all tenancies whether created before or after the
    commencement of this Act. R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;O.2, s.&nbsp;8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 8(1) imposes a duty of care on the landlord to
    any person coming on to the property where the premises are occupied under a
    tenancy in which the landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair of
    the property. This section applies whether or not the landlord is found to be
    an occupier. Section 8(2) adds a second requirement, namely, that only if the
    landlord’s default is such as to be actionable at the suit of the tenant will
    the landlord’s default constitute a breach of the landlord’s duty under s.
    8(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons clearly reference s. 8 and
    its requirements in finding that the landlord owed no duty of care to the
    appellant. While the trial judge does not explain why the requirements of s. 8
    are not met in this case, this conclusion appears to rest on his finding that
    the rental agreement relieved the landlord of all maintenance obligations. In
    this court, the respondent suggested no other basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasoning seems to be that the rental agreement
    rendered this a tenancy under which the landlord is <u>not</u> responsible for
    the maintenance or repair of the property, so that s. 8(1) was not engaged. Further,
    the rental agreement would render the landlord’s default not actionable by the
    tenants under s. 8(2) because it gives the tenants complete responsibility for
    maintenance of the premises. Hence, the reasoning would go, the respondent had
    no duty to the appellant under s. 8(1) of the OLA.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issues and Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the appellant attacks the finding of the
    trial judge that the respondent owed him no duty of care. He raises three
    arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant points out that the respondent
    explicitly admitted in his statement of defence that he was at all material
    times an occupier of the premises within the meaning of the OLA, and was
    responsible for the care, control, and maintenance of the premises. At no time
    did he withdraw this admission. Indeed, the respondent does not contest that in
    this appeal. The trial judge makes no reference to this admission in his
    reasons for judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The consequence of this admission is that the
    respondent must be taken to have the duty of care to the appellant that s. 3(1)
    of the OLA imposes on an occupier. In failing to find this, the trial judge
    erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the tenants were liable
    to the appellant for breach of the duty owed by occupiers under s. 3(1) of the
    OLA to any person coming on to the premises. The tenants permitted the danger
    constituted by the cinder blocks surrounding the fire pit to continue.
    Particularly given that he also created this danger, the same reasoning renders
    the respondent landlord in breach of the duty he has to the appellant as an
    occupier under s. 3(1) of the OLA for permitting the same danger. Thus, in my
    view, the respondent’s admission, together with these findings of fact by the
    trial judge, necessitate the conclusion that the respondent is liable to the
    appellant for breach of his duty as occupier under s. 3(1) of the OLA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant’s first argument is enough to
    dispose of the appeal, I propose also to deal with the appellant’s second
    argument. The appellant says that in giving effect to the rental agreement that
    relieved the respondent of maintenance obligations as the basis for finding
    that the requirements of s. 8(1) and (2) of the OLA were not met, the trial
    judge erred in ignoring s. 94(1) and s. 80(1) of the <i>Landlord and Tenant Act</i> R.S.O. 1990 c. L. 7 (the LTA). Those
    sections impose a statutory duty on a residential landlord to maintain the
    premises, a duty that the landlord cannot escape by contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellant. Sections 94(1) and 80(1) of
    the LTA read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>94. (1) A landlord is responsible for providing and
    maintaining the rented premises in a good state of repair and fit for
    habitation during the tenancy and for complying with health and safety
    standards, including any housing standards required by law, and despite the
    fact that any state of non-repair existed to the knowledge of the tenant before
    the tenancy agreement was entered into.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>80. (1) This Part applies to tenancies of
    residential premises and tenancy agreements despite any other Act or Parts I,
    II or III of this Act and despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary
    except as specifically provided in this Part.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 94(1) imposes a statutory responsibility on the
    landlord of residential premises to maintain and repair the premises. Section
    80(1) provides that this responsibility prevails, despite any agreement or
    waiver to the contrary. See <i>Phillips v.
    Dis-Management</i> (1995) 24 O.R. (3d) 435 per Sharpe J. (as he then was).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since this was a residential premises, this statutory
    duty applied to the respondent landlord and could not be removed by his rental
    agreement with the tenants. Nor could the rental agreement serve as a defence
    to the respondent in a suit brought by the tenants if the danger created by the
    cinder blocks had caused them harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The combined effect of ss. 94(1) and 80(1) of the LTA
    is therefore that, for the purposes of s. 8(1) of the OLA, these premises were
    occupied under a tenancy in which the landlord is responsible for the
    maintenance and repair of the premises. Equally, for the purposes of s. 8(2),
    the rental agreement could not prevent the landlord’s default being actionable
    at the suit of the tenants. As a consequence, the respondent landlord had a
    duty of care under s. 8(1) of the OLA, the same duty of care in respect of
    dangers arising from any failure on the landlord’s part in carrying out the
    landlord’s responsibility as is required by this Act to be shown by an occupier
    of the premises. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, s. 8(1) imposes on the respondent the
    same duty of care to the appellant that the respondent would have under s. 3 of
    the OLA as an occupier for a danger arising from his failure to maintain the
    premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, therefore, the respondent not only had a
    duty of care as occupier to the appellant under s. 3 of the OLA. He had a duty
    of care to the appellant under s. 8(1) of the OLA. The trial judge therefore
    erred in finding that the respondent owed no duty of care to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the findings of fact by the trial judge
    also necessarily entail the conclusion that the respondent breached his duty of
    care to the appellant imposed by s. 8(1) of the OLA. Particularly given that he
    created the danger in the first place by installing the cinder blocks
    surrounding the fire pit, by permitting the danger to continue the respondent
    landlord failed in his statutory responsibility to maintain the premises. The
    danger that caused the appellant harm arose from this failure. The respondent
    therefore breached his duty of care to the appellant under s. 8(1) of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the respondent landlord breached his
    duty of care to the appellant, both his duty under s. 3 of the OLA as an
    occupier and his duty under s. 8(1) of the OLA as a landlord with the
    responsibility to repair and maintain the premises. Taking into account the
    appellant’s contributory negligence, assessed by the trial judge at 50%, the
    respondent is therefore responsible for 50% of the damages suffered by the
    appellant jointly and severally with the tenants. I would split the fault
    between the landlord and the two tenants equally, just as the trial judge did
    with the tenants. Each of them should be found at fault for one third of 50% of
    the appellant’s damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the conclusions I have reached, it is
    unnecessary to deal with the appellant’s third argument advancing an error in
    fact finding by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore allowed and the judgment below
    varied to reflect these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is entitled to his costs on a partial
    indemnity basis fixed at $5000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
