  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Mario Miranda became the Chief Financial
    Officer (CFO) of the respondent Lake Shore Gold Corporation on June 1, 2007. On
    the same day, Miranda and Lake Shore entered into an agreement called “Change
    of Control Agreement – Officer” (the Agreement). It entitled him to a payment
    of $175,200 if he ceased to be an officer of Lake Shore within six months of a
    change of control of the company. After he was terminated as CFO on April 14,
    2008, Miranda sought a declaration that he was entitled to this payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge interpreted the Agreement to
    require that Miranda cease to be CFO <u>after</u> the change of control in
    order to receive the payment. Since he was terminated shortly <u>before</u> the
    change, he was not entitled to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges that interpretation. He argues
    that, properly interpreted, the Agreement entitles him to the payment if, as
    happened here, his termination as CFO and the change of control of the company
    occur within six months of each other. With respect to the application judge, I
    agree. I conclude that the Agreement not only applies where the change of
    control comes first, but also applies where the officer is terminated in the
    six months before the change of control. I would therefore allow the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of the material facts are in dispute. The facts
    necessary for the purposes of the appeal begin with the Agreement. It was
    prepared by Lake Shore, and contains only 10 paragraphs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The focus of the debate in this court is the first
    sentence of the first paragraph. It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the event the Officer ceases to be an officer of
    the Corporation for any reason within six months of the date on which control
    of the Corporation changes (which event is called “Change of Control”), the
    Corporation shall pay to the Officer $175,200 (the “Change of Control
    Payment”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The balance of the first paragraph defines when a
    change of control is deemed to occur. While that date was contested at first
    instance, the application judge determined that the change of control took
    place on June 17, 2007. That is not contested in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only other paragraph of importance is paragraph 2:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Change of Control does
    not include removal of the Officer as an officer of the Corporation for cause.
    This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon a voluntary resignation of the
    Officer as an officer of the Corporation unless a Change of Control occurred
    first.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The change of control came about pursuant to the
    Strategic Alliance Agreement between Lake Shore and Hochschild Mining Holdings
    Ltd. made on February 22, 2008. The announcement of this alliance made clear
    that, subject to regulatory approval, Hochschild would make two significant
    purchases of shares of Lake Shore. The first took place on February 25, 2008,
    and the second on June 27, 2008. The application judge found that as a result
    of these purchases, as of June 17, 2008, Hochschild became the new “Control Person”
    of Lake Shore and a “Change of Control” of the company was effected for the
    purposes of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the Strategic Alliance Agreement was to
    obtain significant new capital to allow Lake Shore to develop its mining
    properties. Lake Shore would have a new president who proposed to take it in a
    new direction. The Strategic Alliance Agreement required Lake Shore to commit
    to keeping this new president for five years if possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new president began on March 1, 2008. Shortly
    thereafter, without telling Miranda, he began a search for a new CFO, something
    he believed was needed to fulfil his plans for the new direction for Lake Shore,
    given the new strategic alliance. However, he needed Miranda to complete Lake
    Shore’s current financial statements. This, and the requirement that there be a
    resolution of the board of directors terminating Miranda, meant that his
    termination as an officer of Lake Shore did not take place until April 14,
    2008. There is no suggestion that this termination was for cause. Miranda simply
    did not accord with the post-strategic alliance direction being set for Lake
    Shore.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of these circumstances, Miranda asserted
    that he was entitled to the payment provided for by the Agreement. When Lake
    Shore refused, he brought this application seeking a declaration of his
    entitlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His application was dismissed. The application judge
    first concluded that there had been a change of control for the purposes of the
    Agreement and that it had taken place on June 17, 2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge then turned to the meaning of
    “within” in paragraph 1. He found that when the Agreement is read in its
    entirety, the clear intention of the parties is “...to ensure the retention of
    Miranda’s services as CFO in the event that a change of control may occur in
    the ownership of Lake Shore by incenting him to stay with the Company during
    the period of change.” He accepted the general purpose of change of control
    agreements approved by this court in <i>Montreal
    Trust Co. Of Canada v. Call-Net Enterprises Inc. </i>(2004) 70 O.R. (3d) 90
    (C.A.), that they provide a protective mechanism for both the corporation and
    the executive, with the business purpose of retaining key executives through
    the period of uncertainty that surrounds the process of changing control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to this intention, the application judge
    held that the meaning of “within” in paragraph 1 is clear and unambiguous and
    means the six months “since or after” the date of change of control. He held
    that this was consistent with the commercial interests of the parties at the
    time of the Agreement and found no inconsistency between this interpretation and
    any other provisions of the Agreement, particularly paragraph 2. He concluded
    that to interpret “within” to include the six months before the change of
    control would be contrary to the intention of the parties. Since Miranda’s
    termination as CFO did not occur in the six months after, but rather took place
    before the change of control, he held that Miranda was not entitled to the
    payment. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>[15]	The facts are uncontested. The issue is the meaning to be given to the first sentence of paragraph 1 of the Agreement. Since this is akin to a question of law, not dependant on a nuanced interpretation of disputed facts, both parties assert that the standard of review to be applied in this court is correctness. I agree. See <em>Bell Canada v. The Plan Group</em> (2009) 96 O.R. (3d) 81 (C.A.) at paras. 19-26.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with the application judge that, in this
    case, the task requires an examination of the words in paragraph 1 read in the
    context of the entire Agreement and the shared intention or commercial purpose
    reflected therein. However, I disagree with the conclusion he reached.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most important words are those in the first
    sentence of paragraph 1 of the Agreement. To repeat, they are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the event the Officer ceases to be an officer of
    the Corporation for any reason within six months of the date on which control
    of the Corporation changes (which event is called “Change of Control”), the
    Corporation shall pay to the Officer $175,200 (the “Change of Control
    Payment”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These words describe two events, namely ceasing to be
    an officer of Lake Shore, and change of control of the company. These events
    must occur within a period of six months as a precondition to Miranda’s
    entitlement. Nothing in the nature of the events themselves suggests that the
    change of control must precede ceasing to be an officer. The change of control
    need not cause the individual to cease being an officer. The Agreement
    contemplates that this can happen “for any reason”. Requiring that one event
    occur “within six months of” the other simply means that no more than six
    months can separate them. In other words, they must occur within six months of
    each other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, looking only at the language of paragraph 1, it
    not only applies where the officer resigns or is terminated in the six months
    after a change of control. It also has application where the cessation precedes
    the change of control by six months or less. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This meaning is supported by the second sentence of
    paragraph 2. That sentence provides that, if the cessation precedes the change
    of control, the Agreement terminates if the cessation occurs through voluntary
    resignation. In that circumstance, no payment entitlement arises. If paragraph 1
    did not encompass the cessation coming first, this sentence would be meaningless
    and unnecessary. However the parties have expressly addressed the situation in
    which the cessation precedes the change of control and have explicitly provided
    that cessation by way of voluntary resignation does not attract the payment. By
    implication, cessation as an officer through termination in the six months preceding
    change of control (ie. what happened here) is covered by the Agreement and
    triggers the right to payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent looks to paragraph 3 of the Agreement to
    support its position. That paragraph provides that the change of control
    payment will be made “within 15 days of” being notified that a change of
    control has occurred. Clearly, notification of the change of control must
    precede payment, because only after notification do all parties know of the
    obligation to make the payment. The required order of the two events described
    in paragraph 3 is dictated by the nature of those events, not the “within 15
    days of” language. By contrast, the nature of the two events described in
    paragraph 1 does not dictate the order in which they must occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the intention of the parties reflected in
    this Agreement is to provide a protective mechanism for both Lake Shore and its
    officers to retain the officers and ensure their loyalty during the time of
    uncertainty that arises during a period of change of control. However that time
    of uncertainty does not just follow the change of control. It also includes the
    period during which the change is being brought about.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The meaning contended for by Miranda is fully
    consistent with this commercial purpose. It is not only the payment that the
    company must make if the officer resigns or is terminated in the six months <u>after</u> the change of control that provides comfort and incentive to the officer to
    stay during the period of uncertainty. The payment that company must make if it
    terminates the officer in the six months leading up to the change also provides
    the officer with comfort and incentive to stay, knowing that he or she is
    protected against being terminated without cause as part of the change of
    direction for the company that often accompanies the unfolding change of
    control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The latter is exactly what happened here. Despite being
    aware of the impending change of control, Miranda stayed to do his work as CFO
    until April 14, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, I conclude that the respondent’s obligation
    to make the change of control payment to the appellant arises if the appellant’s
    ceasing to be an officer and the change of control occur within six months of
    each other, regardless of which occurs first, except only if he resigns before
    the change. This reflects the words used in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the agreement,
    read in light of the entire Agreement, and serves the intention and commercial
    purpose of the parties. On these facts, therefore, the appellant qualifies for
    the payment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, and grant the order sought by
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agree that if we were to allow the appeal,
    the appellant is entitled to costs of the application on a substantial
    indemnity basis, which we fix at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and
    applicable taxes. The appellant is also entitled to his partial indemnity costs
    of the appeal which we fix at $7,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable
    taxes.</p>
