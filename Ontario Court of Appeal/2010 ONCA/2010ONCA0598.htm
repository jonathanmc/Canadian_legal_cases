  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in this appeal is the test that s. 28(6) of
    the <i>Canadian Transportation Accident
    Investigation and Safety Board Act</i>, R.S.C. 1989 C-3 (the Act) requires the
    court to apply before ordering production of an aircrafts cockpit voice
    recorder (CVR) that the Act deems otherwise privileged. In a thoughtful and
    comprehensive set of reasons, the motion judge found the test satisfied and
    ordered production of the CVR on certain terms. For the reasons that follow, I
    agree with him and would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    August 2, 2005 an Air France flight landed in a severe thunderstorm at
    Torontos Pearson International Airport. It overshot the runway, pitched into a
    ravine, and burst into flames. The aircraft was totally destroyed. Fortunately,
    no lives were lost, but passengers were injured, some of them seriously.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    class action was commenced on behalf of the passengers against a number of
    parties. A multi-million dollar lawsuit was also commenced by Air France and
    its insurers. The respondent NAV Canada (NAV) is responsible for air traffic
    control at the airport. It is one of the defendants in both lawsuits. Its
    pleadings allege that the Air France pilots were negligent in the way in which
    they approached the runway and landed the aircraft that night.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under
    the Act, the appellant Transportation Safety Board of Canada (the Board) is
    charged with investigation of aircraft accidents. It is mandated to make
    findings as to their causes in order to advance transportation safety.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    is not a party to any of the litigation arising out of this crash, but in the
    course of its investigation, it took possession of the aircrafts CVR. The CVR
    contained complete recordings of the conversations between the pilots, and
    their communications with air traffic control prior to the crash. The Board
    investigators interviewed the two pilots at length, and used the CVR to assist
    the pilots in refreshing their memories and reconstructing the final two hours
    of the flight. As the motion judge found, not surprisingly, there is some
    concern about their imperfect recollection without such assistance.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    completing its investigation, the Board made public a very detailed report.
    While it is prevented by the Act from assigning fault or determining liability,
    the motion judge found that the Boards report suggests that certain acts and
    omissions of the pilots during the last two hours of the flight, particularly
    in the last thirty minutes, may have contributed to the crash. While the report
    does not quote the pilots conversations verbatim, it does contain the
    substance of much of their communications.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    28 of the Act provides that an on-board recording like the CVR is privileged,
    and not required to be produced in any legal proceeding. It also allows the
    Board to make use of the recording in discharging its mandate but prohibits the
    Board from communicating it to anyone.</span></p>

    the section also allows a court to order its production if a request is made,
    and a court, after listening to it, and giving the Board an opportunity to make
    representations, concludes that the public interest in the proper
    administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege that the
    section accords to it. The relevant subsections of s. 28 read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Definition
    of on-board recording</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>28.(1)

    no person, including any person to whom access is provided under this section,
    shall </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(<i>a</i>) knowingly communicate an on-board
    recording or permit it to be communicated to any person; or</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Access

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(3)

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Use
    by Board</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(4)
    The Board may make such use of any on-board recording obtained under this Act
    as it considers necessary in the interests of transportation safety, but,
    subject to subsection (5), shall not knowingly communicate or permit to be
    communicated to anyone any portion thereof that is unrelated to the causes or
    contributing factors of the transportation occurrence under investigation or to
    the identification of safety deficiencies.</span></p>

    the circumstances of the case that the public interest in the proper
    administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the
    on-board recording by virtue of this section, order the production and
    discovery of the on-board recording, subject to such restrictions or conditions
    as the court or coroner deems appropriate, and may require any person to give
    evidence that relates to the on-board recording.</span></p>

    if NAV meets the requirements of s. 28(6) of the Act it also meets the
    requirements of the Rule. That is not in issue in this court.</span></p>

    decision by describing the task he set for himself:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[110]
    In order to apply the statutory test in s. 28 of the <i>TSB Act</i>, I must first consider the content of the CVR and the
    circumstances of this case. I must then determine whether, in the circumstances
    of the case, the public interest in the proper administration of justice
    outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on-board recording by
    virtue of that section. This in turn requires that I consider the meaning and
    content of the public interest in the proper administration of justice and
    the importance of the privilege attached to the CVR. This necessarily
    involves a balancing of the two interests. If, having engaged in this balancing
    process, I determine that production is desirable, I may impose such restrictions
    and conditions as I deem appropriate.</span></p>

    conclusions about the contents of the CVR:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[113]
    Having listened to the recording and read the transcript, I have no doubt
    whatsoever that the contents of the CVR are highly relevant, probative and
    reliable and that they are of incalculable value in the investigation of <i>this accident</i>. Neither the TSB nor the
    interveners dispute this as a general proposition and indeed the TSBs report
    makes it clear, as noted earlier, that the use of the CVR was a very useful
    tool in interviewing the pilots and in reconstructing the final critical
    minutes of the flight. In the context of this litigation, in which the
    communications between the pilots is an important issue, I am satisfied that
    the contents of the CVR are very relevant to the issues, very reliable, and
    contain no private, prejudicial or scandalous material. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

    the final paragraph of his reasons, the motion judge considered the separate

    seeking to reverse the order at first instance, the appellant Board raises
    three arguments. None attack the balancing done by the motion judge or the
    weight he attached to the factors he considered. These exercises of judicial
    discretion would attract considerable deference on appellate review. Rather,
    the arguments allege errors of law for which the standard of review is
    correctness.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the appellant argues that the motion judge rejected the proper legal test for
    determining whether production should be ordered, and in doing so applied a
    threshold that must be met to order production that is lower than that provided
    by the legislation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    do not agree. The motion judge clearly understood that the test he was required
    to apply is that prescribed by s. 28(6) of the Act, particulary s. 28(6)(c).
    His description of the task he set for himself, quoted above, puts this beyond
    doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He
    then proceeded to carry out the task exactly as described by the Act. Having
    examined the CVR recording and found it highly relevant, probative and reliable
    on the issues central to the litigation, he went on to an examination of the
    circumstances of the particular case before him, and concluded that the public
    interest in the administration of justice served by production outweighs the
    importance attached to the statutory privilege served by non-production. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor
    do I think that by proceeding in this way the motion judge lowered the bar set
    by s. 28(6) by effectively diminishing the importance attached to the
    privilege. There is no doubt about that importance. It is reflected in the
    requirement of the Act that the privilege prevail in all circumstances. The
    only exception is if a particular case can be brought within the circumstances
    described in s. 28(6). The reasons of the motion judge make clear that he was
    well aware of that importance. However, contrary to the appellants argument,
    s. 28(6) does not require the moving the party to prove or the court to
    describe the circumstances to be exceptional or rare or compelling or
    unusual for production to be ordered. What the court must find is that in the
    particular case, the public interest in the administration of justice outweighs
    the importance attached to the statutory privilege. That is what the motion
    judge did here. In doing so he put the bar exactly where the Act specifies.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants second argument is that the test used by the motion judge displays
    three legal errors.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant says the motion judge equated the public interest in the proper
    administration of justice with whether the CVR contained the best and most
    reliable evidence of the cockpit conversations.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    do not agree. The motion judge did not hold that the public interest in the
    administration of justice prevails here only because the CVR is the best and
    most reliable evidence. In assessing the importance of production of the CVR to
    the public interest in the proper administration of justice, the motion judge
    considered a number of factors beyond whether the CVR is the best and most
    reliable evidence. These include that the contents of the CVR concern the central
    issue in the litigation; there is some concern about the reliability of the
    pilots <i>viva voce</i> evidence; that the
    CVR has already been used to refresh their recollections; that one pilot
    consents to the release of the CVR and Air France takes no position; that the
    CVR contains no communications that are personal or sensational or disturbing;
    and that this is important and substantial litigation. All these circumstances
    add to the importance of the public interest in the administration of justice
    when production of the CVR is being considered. They were appropriate for the
    motion judge to consider.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant says that the motion judge also erred in law by failing to require
    NAV to establish that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the CVR were
    not produced.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge held that a miscarriage of justice test is more stringent than
    s. 28 requires. I agree. The section does not limit production only to a case
    where otherwise a miscarriage of justice would occur. That is not what s. 28
    provides, nor, as the motion judge said, would it be a test easy to apply
    prospectively.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
    said, just as the factors that the motion judge considered that make production
    of the CVR important if the public interest in the administration of justice is
    to be properly served, these factors also mean that failure to order production
    makes an unjust result more likely.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Viewed
    either way, the court must take the impact of the decision about production on
    the public confidence in the administration of justice and weigh it against the
    impact of that decision on the statutory privilege. I disagree with the
    appellant however that unless a miscarriage of justice would result without
    production the latter must always outweigh the former in importance. The Act
    requires the court to consider all the circumstances of the case in assessing
    the balance.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the motion judge erred in law in misapprehending the
    evidence of the importance of the CVR privilege. It says that he failed to
    appreciate that the disclosure of the contents of the CVR would, in the
    appellants opinion, remove or greatly diminish the trust pilots have in the
    confidentiality of the appellants investigation process, thus reducing the
    information they would provide to it in future.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    his reasons address in more detail any possible impact of disclosure on pilot
    communications in the cockpit, the motion judge concluded that, in general, the
    appellants suggestion of a chilling effect from production has no evidentiary
    basis and is nothing more than speculation. While the appellants opinion is
    otherwise, it is simply baldly asserted and is unsubstantiated by evidence, for
    example, that previous orders for disclosure have caused pilots to be less
    cooperative with subsequent investigations. It was entirely open to the motion
    judge to discount the appellants opinion as he did.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants third argument is that the motion judge erred in ordering
    production of the flight animation because counsel had agreed beforehand that
    this issue would not be part of the motion. As a consequence, the appellant
    says that the issue was not argued at first instance. The respondent does not
    seriously contest this, and indeed the record appears to substantiate the
    appellants position. I would therefore find in the appellants favour on this
    issue and order that paragraph five be removed from the order appealed from.</span></p>
