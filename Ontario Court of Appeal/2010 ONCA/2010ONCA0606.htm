style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two grounds of appeal against his conviction on
    three counts of having sexual intercourse with a female person not his wife and
    under the age of 14 from January 1978 to December 1982. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was the appellants stepdaughter.  In addition to the
    three incidents charged in the indictment, evidence was given of a fourth
    incident when the complainant's mother and five-year-old brother returned home
    to find the appellant in the bedroom with the complainant.  The complainant was
    on the bed, naked, and the appellant was standing beside the bed pulling up his
    pants.  Both the complainant and her brother testified that their mother, G.S.,
    yelled at the appellant and kicked him out of the apartment.  G.S. allowed the
    appellant to return to the house within approximately one week and thereafter
    the sexual abuse against the complainant ceased.  G.S. did not testify, nor did
    the appellant. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 1. Did the trial judge
    err by failing to charge the jury as to the limited use of the evidence that G.S.
    had kicked the appellant out of the apartment?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge instructed the jury that the evidence that G.S. had
    kicked the appellant out of the apartment could only be used for the purpose of
    assessing the complainants overall credibility.  The trial judge further
    cautioned the jury: You cannot use this evidence to reason that because [the
    appellant] was found pulling up his pants on this one occasion he must have
    committed the offences on the other three occasions for which he has been
    charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the evidence of G.S.s conduct contains an
    implied assertion that she had caught the appellant in the act of molesting the
    complainant and that the use of G.S.s conduct to support such an inference
    offends the rule against hearsay.  The appellant concedes that the evidence of
    G.S.s conduct was admissible as part of the narrative and that it was relevant
    to assessing the complainants account of the timing and cessation of the
    alleged historic sexual assaults.  However, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge was required to direct the jury that they could not use the evidence of G.S.s
    conduct to support an inference that she had caught the appellant molesting the
    complainant.  Related to this argument is the fact that during its
    deliberations the jury asked if there were any legal reasons why G.S. did not
    testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the trial judge erred by failing to give any
    further instruction in relation to the evidence of G.S.s conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants trial counsel did not request such an instruction during
    the pre-charge conference in which the trial judge presented his draft charge,
    nor was any objection taken to the charge that was delivered.  The appellants
    trial counsel also agreed with the manner in which the trial judge answered the
    jurys question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel's failure to object is not dispositive but does lend
    support to the respondent Crown's position that the instruction given by the
    trial judge was entirely adequate in the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the evidence of G.S.s reaction to the fourth incident
    constitutes hearsay by conduct a point we need not decide  the limiting
    instruction to the jury was adequate.  The jury would have understood from the
    trial judges instruction that even if it might be inferred from the fourth
    incident that the appellant had been found molesting the complainant, that was
    not evidence that could be used to determine whether or not he had committed the
    acts alleged in the three counts of the indictment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we do not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 2.
    Did the trial judge err by failing to instruct the jury as to the significance
    of evidence of discussions between the complainant and her brother?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant that there was some evidence that the
    complainant and her brother had discussed the fourth incident before her
    brother spoke to the police and that given the age of her brother at the time
    of the fourth incident, this could have affected his evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge might well have instructed the jury to take the
    discussions into account in deciding the weight to be attached to their
    evidence as to the fourth incident.  However, we do not agree that in the
    circumstances of this case such an instruction was mandatory or that the trial
    judge erred by failing to give it.  We agree with the respondent Crown that
    this was not a similar fact case where the probative value of the evidence is
    derived from the objective improbability of two people coincidentally giving
    remarkably similar evidence.  Both the complainant and her brother testified as
    to the same incident of prior discreditable conduct and it was open to the
    trial judge to conclude that no special instruction was required as to the
    possibility that there had been some collaboration.  Collaboration was an issue
    the defence was entitled to argue, and in his summary of the defence position,
    the trial judge did mention the discussion between the complainant and her
    brother.  However, collusion was not an issue upon which the judge was required
    to instruct the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we do not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</p>
