  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant appeals against both conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The Conviction Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The sexual
    assault charge arose out of an incident that occurred at the Toronto West
    Detention Centre. After a fight allegedly involving the appellant and three
    other inmates, the appellant was placed in a cell with the complainant and a
    third inmate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      During the
    early evening of January 22, 2003, the appellant, the complainant and the third
    inmate were involved in a conversation in their cell. The third inmate was on
    the top bunk of the bunk bed in the cell and the complainant was lying on his
    stomach on the bottom bunk covered by a sheet and at least one blanket.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      According to
    the complainant, immediately prior to the incident, the appellant was sitting
    on a bench in the cell, talking and massaging his genitals. The complainant got
    tired of that, turned away and tried to go sleep. A short time later, the
    complainant heard the appellant say, “nice ass”. The appellant then climbed on
    top of the complainant, placed his hands on the complainant’s shoulders and
    began thrusting his genitals against the complainant’s buttocks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    complainant estimated that the appellant remained on his back for about 10
    seconds. During this period, the appellant thrust his genitals against the
    complainant’s buttocks about 8-12 times and made a comment along the lines of
    “oh, yeah, baby”. The complainant said he reported the incident to correctional
    officials the next morning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    complainant testified that he was shocked by the incident. He said that he and
    the appellant had previously shared a cell for 12 days at another institution,
    and during that period he made it clear to the appellant that he was not
    interested in a sexual relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In cross-examination,
    the complainant described the appellant as “a very intimidating and forceful
    man” who repeatedly asked for sex when they were cell mates at the other
    institution. When asked how they ended up as cell mates if he was so afraid of
    the appellant, the complainant said the appellant “always honoured” when he
    said no. When asked why he did not protest when the appellant was placed in his
    cell, the complainant said he had no control, as the guards simply walked up
    and placed the appellant in his cell. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police officer who took a statement from the
    complainant at the Detention Centre in the early evening on the day after the
    incident was also called as a Crown witness. The officer confirmed that the third
    occupant of the cell declined to provide a statement. He also confirmed that he
    had no note of the complainant telling him that the appellant was playing with
    himself prior to the incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified at trial and admitted
    straddling the complainant, shaking him by the shoulders and saying, “<span
class=GramE>who’s</span> your daddy now, who’s your daddy now”. However, he
    claimed that the incident occurred in the context of explaining to the third
    inmate how he and the complainant knew each other. The appellant said he and
    the complainant were bantering about who was “the daddy” and who was “the kid”
    when the two were cell mates previously. The appellant denied “humping” the
    complainant or making the comments ascribed to him by the complainant. He said that
    the three men continued joking after the incident and also claimed that the complainant
    got his food for him the next day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, the appellant acknowledged that
    he is a considerably larger man than the respondent, saying “I’ve probably got
    50, 60 pounds on him”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The trial
    judge’s reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge delivered oral reasons for finding the
    appellant guilty of sexual assault without calling on the Crown for submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After observing that the appellant’s version of events
    would support a conviction for assault, the trial judge described the
    appellant’s evidence as “argumentative ... aggressively delivered and in many
    ways internally and externally inconsistent.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of example, the trial judge referred to the
    appellant’s evidence that he was not interested in homosexual sex and the fact
    that the appellant proceeded to volunteer detailed evidence about how homosexual
    sex could be arranged in a prison setting. As a second example, the trial judge
    noted that the appellant claimed in examination in-chief that prisoners can
    move cells at will but then acknowledged in cross-examination that a more
    restrictive process applies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the trial judge noted that the appellant’s
    evidence about the complainant laughing after the incident was inconsistent
    with the objective facts, namely, that the appellant complained the next
    morning immediately after being released from his cell. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge said the appellant’s many
    convictions for offences of dishonesty supported his decision to reject the
    appellant’s evidence. The trial judge also noted the appellant’s admission that
    he is at least 50-60 pounds heavier than the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in addressing the issue of whether the assault
    was sexual in nature, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence
    concerning what happened during the incident as well as his evidence about the
    appellant’s prior sexual advances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Grounds of
    Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two main issues on his conviction
    appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the trial judge applied a higher standard of scrutiny
    to the appellant’s evidence than that which he applied to the complainant’s
    evidence; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>ineffective</span> assistance of
    counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the first issue, the appellant argues that
    the trial judge erred by rejecting the appellant’s evidence based on matters
    that he described as inconsistencies that were not in fact true
    inconsistencies, while at the same time ignoring important inconsistencies in
    the complainant’s evidence – such as the fact that the complainant failed to
    mention that the appellant was massaging his genitals in his statement to the
    police and the complainant’s claim that he feared the appellant as compared to
    his evidence that the appellant was a “gentleman” who “always honoured when
    [the complainant] said no”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the second issue, the appellant contends
    that trial counsel’s failure to pursue various avenues of cross-examination and
    argument, and failure to properly prepare the appellant to testify at trial,
    constitutes ineffective assistance and may well have contributed to the trial
    judge’s flawed analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, trial counsel failed to cross-examine the
    complainant about the fact that he did not tell the police officer the appellant
    was massaging his genitals; nor did he cross-examine the complainant about the
    fact that the disclosure package contained a statement from a correctional officer
    indicating the complainant asked to speak to the correctional officer on the
    day after the incident at about 6:32 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, defence counsel at trial was relatively
    inexperienced. He was asked to fill in for appellant’s counsel on short notice
    after appellant’s counsel was forced to continue a trial in another jurisdiction
    and when the appellant insisted on proceeding. Although defence counsel at
    trial had previously acted as duty counsel, he had never conducted a trial –
    and he acknowledged he would have asked for an adjournment, despite the
    appellant’s instructions, had he been aware of the prospect of a dangerous
    offender application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>1.</b><b> Standard of Scrutiny</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept the appellant’s submission that the
    trial judge erred by applying a higher standard of scrutiny to the appellant’s evidence
    than that which he applied to the complainant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the trial judge described the
    appellant’s evidence as “argumentative ... aggressively delivered and in many
    ways internally and externally inconsistent.” Although the examples the trial
    judge gave of inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence may not be extreme, I
    reject the appellant’s claim that they do not reflect inconsistency. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading the trial judge’s reasons fairly, the
    inconsistency in the appellant’s evidence about homosexual sex arises from the
    fact that the appellant volunteered evidence about obtaining homosexual sex in
    prison after denying that he was interested in homosexual sex. It was the
    voluntary nature of these comments that led the trial judge to identify them as
    inconsistent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Although the
    inconsistency in the appellant’s evidence concerning a prisoner’s ability to change
    cells may appear small when the appellant’s evidence is considered in
    isolation, it takes on greater significance when considered in the context of
    the complainant’s evidence that he had no say when the appellant was moved into
    his cell. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in my view, the fact that the trial judge may
    have overstated the evidence somewhat when he said the <i>objective</i> facts demonstrate the complainant reported the incident
    immediately upon being released from the cells the next morning does not affect
    the validity of his conclusion that the objective facts demonstrate that the
    complainant reported the incident at an early opportunity, a factor that
    supported the complainant’s evidence that he perceived the incident as a sexual
    assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the trial judge’s failure to allude to matters
    that the appellant claims should have affected the trial judge’s assessment of
    the complainant’s evidence, I observe that the trial judge had the distinct
    advantage of observing the manner in which both the appellant and the
    complainant testified. It was for him to determine the significance to be
    attached to the various portions of their testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on my review of the trial judge’s reasons, he was
    satisfied the complainant’s evidence about the appellant’s conduct had the ring
    of truth when considered in the context of the whole of the evidence, including
    the manner in which the appellant testified; and he rejected the appellant’s evidence
    for the reasons that he explained. I see no basis for interfering with the
    trial judge’s assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>2.</b><b> Ineffective Assistance</b></p>

    [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 26, the Supreme Court explained that “[f]or an

    first, that counsel's acts or omissions constituted incompetence and second,
    that a miscarriage of justice resulted.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the Supreme Court cautioned against deciding the first branch of the test in
    cases where prejudice is not established: “[if] it is apparent that no

    consider the performance component of the analysis.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even assuming defence counsel at trial provided
    ineffective assistance to the appellant, I am not satisfied the appellant has

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my review of the appellant’s evidence, he confirmed,
    through his own testimony, that he committed the essential elements of a sexual
    assault. The appellant acknowledged that he jumped on the complainant’s back
    without prior warning and that, while on the complainant’s back, he said the
    words “<span class=GramE>whose</span> your daddy now, whose your daddy now.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly in the context of a prison setting, the
    size differential between the two men and the fact of a prompt complaint by the
    complainant, I see no air of reality to the appellant’s assertion that the
    conduct that he admitted amounted to anything other than a sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant provided written instructions to defence
    counsel at trial confirming his desire to testify despite the risks involved.
    Appellant’s counsel on appeal acknowledges that was a “client decision” and
    does not assert incompetence in that regard. Moreover, no issue was raised on
    appeal concerning any obligation to obtain disclosure of the Crown’s position
    on sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. Based

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The Trial
    Judge’s Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early in his reasons, the trial judge noted that the
    appellant has a high risk of re-offending violently and sexually and that the
    live issue at the hearing was whether the appellant should be designated a
    dangerous offender or a long-term offender. In particular, in closing
    submissions on sentence, the defence acknowledged that a determinate sentence alone
    would not be appropriate. Taking account of pre-sentence custody of
    approximately 25 months attributable to the predicate offence, the defence
    requested a further three month sentence together with a long-term offender
    designation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After, reviewing the facts of the predicate offence,
    the trial judge turned to the appellant’s extensive adult criminal record. He
    began by reviewing the appellant’s six convictions for acts of violence, some
    of which involved sexual violence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1991, the appellant was convicted of a robbery
    involving the use of violence to obtain an expensive sports bike. Later in
    1991, he was convicted of uttering threats to a taxi driver: “Drive or we’re
    fucking dead.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1992, the appellant was convicted of sexual assault
    with a weapon. After being refused sex by a young woman he met in a bar, the
    appellant held a knife to her throat and attempted to smother her with a
    pillow. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In February 1994, the appellant pleaded guilty to
    sexually assaulting a young woman he had offered a ride. After driving her to a
    vacant lot, he reclined her seat and said, “<span class=GramE>if</span> you
    move I will kill you.” He mounted her and held her by the throat but the woman
    was able to escape when passers-by arrived. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1996, the appellant pleaded guilty to a sexual
    assault that occurred just 18 hours after the offence for which he was
    convicted in 1994. The appellant raped a 16-year-old girl who he encountered as
    she was walking to her aunt’s home. He came upon her from behind, placed his
    hand over her mouth and threatened to kill her if she screamed. After placing
    her on the ground, the appellant asked, “<span class=GramE>do</span> you like
    having sex or dying?” During sentencing for this offence, the appellant was
    warned, both by his counsel and by the presiding judge, that he could face
    dangerous offender proceedings in the future if he continued engaging in such
    conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1996, the appellant pleaded guilty to assault causing
    bodily harm. This incident involved kicking a fellow inmate in a detention
    centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also reviewed the appellant’s six
    convictions for breach of recognizance and attempting to obstruct justice and
    referred to the appellant’s four convictions for offences of dishonesty as well
    as his four convictions for drug related offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> After reviewing
    these convictions, the trial judge noted that in the fifteen years preceding
    the dangerous offender hearing, the appellant had been in the community for
    only about 18 months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the statutory criteria, the trial judge
    concluded that the appellant satisfied the test for being declared a dangerous
    offender under s. 753(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. In particular, the trial
    judge found that evidence in all of the sexual assaults, including the
    predicate offence, demonstrated a failure on the part of the appellant to
    control his sexual impulses. Further, the expert evidence at the hearing
    demonstrated that the appellant was at a high risk to re-offend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Klassen, for the Crown, diagnosed the appellant as
    having a serious personality disorder with one or more substance abuse
    disorders and potentially one or more paraphilias. Dr. Federoff, for the
    defence described the appellant as suffering from poly-substance abuse, alcohol
    abuse and anti-social personality disorder. SORAG and STATIC-99 testing
    demonstrated the appellant had among the highest risks of re-offence for
    violent and sexually violent offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that he poses a clear and present
    danger to others, and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to
    them by future failure to control his sexual impulses. In this case, repetitive
    past behaviour may be considered a reasonable predictor of future conduct,
    especially in light of his test results.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge went on to hold that the appellant also
    satisifed the statutory criteria for being declared a dangerous offender under
    ss. 753(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)(i) and 753(1)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and that he constitutes a
    threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the issue of whether the risk to the
    community could be reduced to an acceptable level by less intrusive means, the
    trial judge concluded that it could not. He noted that, having regard to the
    appellant’s record, even in the absence of the dangerous offender application, it
    would have been appropriate to impose a sentence in excess of two years’
    imprisonment for the predicate offence. Moreover, based on his previous conclusions,
    the trial judge was satisfied there was a substantial risk the appellant would
    re-offend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Drs. Klassen and Federoff had opined as to the
    possibility of controlling the risk if certain hypothetical factors were to
    occur (such as age burn-out, following treatment programs, abandoning alcohol
    and drug use and abandoning a criminal and hedonistic lifestyle), the trial
    judge was not satisfied that there was any “reality” to the doctors’
    expressions of hope that the appellant would take the necessary positive steps
    in the future. Concerning age burn-out, the trial judge said [p. 41]:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Smith is 35 and the 12 year maximum period of
    control under the long-term offender designation would expire long before the
    upper range of any potential burn-out factor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the trial judge was not satisfied that
    there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the appellant’s risk
    in the community, and the trial judge declined to make a long-term offender
    designation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Grounds of
    Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue on the sentence appeal relates to the
    trial judge’s statement that there is a “12 year maximum period of control
    under the long-term offender designation”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that this statement amounts to
    an error in law because the maximum period of control under a long term
    offender designation for the appellant is 20 years, being the maximum available
    determinate sentence for the predicate offence (10 years) plus a 10-year
    supervision order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, where the alternative is a
    dangerous offender designation, the general principles of sentencing should not
    constrain a sentencing judge from imposing the maximum determinate sentence for
    the predicate offence, even where that sentence would be disproportionate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in
    concluding that the appellant met the criteria for being designated a dangerous
    offender under s. 753(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, and claims that this finding was central to the trial’s judge
    assessment of whether the appellant’s risk could eventually be controlled in
    the community. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in failing to find that there is a reasonable possibility that that the
    appellant’s risk can eventually be controlled in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept these submissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the appellant’s first submission, the
    Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that when making a long-term offender
    designation, imposing a determinate sentence is a distinct process to which
    “the normative principles and objectives of sentencing” apply and that it is
    not to be confused with the process of fixing a period of supervision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. L.M.</i>,
    [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, the accused was designated a long-term offender. He was
    sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for sexually assaulting his daughter and to
    a further five years imprisonment for child pornography offences relating to
    his daughter and, in addition, a ten year supervision order was imposed. The
    Quebec Court of Appeal varied the determinate sentences to six years and three
    years respectively. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the sentence
    imposed by the trial judge was restored. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lebel J., writing for the majority, rejected an
    argument that the principle of proportionality should apply to the combined
    period of incarceration and community supervision, holding that the decisions
    as to an appropriate sentence and as to the length of the supervision order are
    conceptually distinct: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[47]<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the sentencing judge will not
    calculate the length of each of these steps in the same way.&nbsp; A number of
    factors are considered in determining the length of a prison sentence,
    including, to name but a few, the gravity of the offence, the degree of
    responsibility of the offender, the parity principle and the possibility of
    imposing a less restrictive sanction.&nbsp; In contrast, the length of a period
    of community supervision is based on an offender’s criminal past and on the
    likelihood that he or she will reoffend, which are addressed in the assessment
    report.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[48]<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Finally, in practice, the effect of a
    sentence is to deprive the offender of his or her liberty, whereas community
    supervision is aimed at reintegrating the offender into the community under the
    supervision of the Correctional Service of Canada.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
    period of community supervision does not begin until after the sentence
    (imprisonment) has been served.&nbsp; <i>From
    this perspective, the preferred approach for a judge considering a period of
    community supervision is very different from the one that must be taken in
    determining the length of a sentence of imprisonment. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, under the heading  “Relationship to the Determination of the
    Appropriate Sentence”, Lebel J. wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[49] Nevertheless,
    the judge determining the length of an offender’s sentence of imprisonment will
    also receive the application to find the offender to be a long&#8209;term
    offender before passing sentence.&nbsp; As a result, the judge will quite
    likely tend to consider both decisions at the same time.&nbsp; He or she may
    accordingly find it difficult to observe the conceptual distinction between the
    two decisions.&nbsp; <i>Despite these
    practical difficulties, it is important to remain faithful to the distinction
    between sentencing and the imposition of a supervision period.</i> &nbsp;<i>A judge who confuses these two processes
    risks straying from the normative principles and the objectives of sentencing.</i>&nbsp;
    A judge who does so would also neglect the specific objective of the procedure
    for finding an offender to be a long&#8209;term offender, which requires the
    application of different principles.&nbsp; Parliament intended that the judge
    determine the appropriate sentence first.&nbsp; After doing so, the judge is to
    ask, in light of Parliament’s objective of protecting the public, whether a
    period of supervision is warranted.&nbsp; The period of community supervision
    cannot therefore be equated with a new period of deprivation of liberty
    consecutive to the one resulting from the sentence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant argues that, where the only
    alternative is a dangerous offender designation, it is unnecessary to apply the
    general principles of sentencing when imposing a determinate sentence on a
    long-term offender for the predicate offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject the appellant’s argument. In my opinion, had
    Parliament intended that the general principles of sentencing should not apply in
    such circumstances, it would have said so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I see no error in the trial judge’s
    statement that there is a “12 year maximum period of control under the
    long-term offender designation”. On my reading of his reasons, the trial judge
    had determined that two years imprisonment was the maximum determinate sentence
    he could impose for the predicate offence in addition to pre-sentence custody.
    Taking account of the 25 months of pre-sentence custody attributable to the
    predicate offence, in my view, a determinate sentence exceeding the two years
    imprisonment proposed by the trial judge would offend the principle of
    proportionality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred
    in finding that the appellant met the dangerous offender criteria under s.
    753(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the<i> Criminal Code</i> or that he erred in declining to designate the appellant a
    long-term offender. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave careful reasons rooted in the
    evidence for finding that the appellant satisfied the criteria under s. 753(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) and for holding that a long-term offender designation
    is not appropriate. I see no basis on which to interfere with his conclusions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
