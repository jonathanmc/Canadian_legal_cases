  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeals of Mr. Paszczenko and Mr. Lima were heard on
    the same day.  The central issue in each
    concerns the manner in which the Crown must prove the facts underlying the four
    assumptions upon which expert toxicology reports filed in “over 80” cases where
    the breath test has not been administered within two hours of the driving
    incident are routinely based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the jargon of these cases, the four assumptions are
    commonly referred to as (i) no “bolus drinking”, i.e., no rapid consumption of
    large amounts of alcohol shortly prior to the incident; (ii) no consumption of
    alcohol between the incident and the breath test; (iii) an “elimination rate”
    of 10 to 20 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood per hour; and
    (iv) a two-hour “plateau” after drinking where the rate of elimination does not
    change.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Mr. Paszczenko and Mr. Lima were convicted in the
    Ontario Court of Justice of operating a motor vehicle while the concentration
    of alcohol in their blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres
    of blood – Mr. Paszczenko by Justice D.P. Cole, and Mr. Lima by Justice A.
    Tuck-Jackson.  On appeal to the Superior
    Court of Justice, Mr. Paszczenko’s conviction was overturned by Justice F.
    Kiteley; Mr. Lima’s conviction was affirmed by Justice R. Clark.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the Crown’s
    appeal in the Paszczenko case and dismiss Mr. Lima’s appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts in Paszczenko</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 23, 2005, Mr. Paszczenko was involved in a
    rear-end collision with another vehicle in the Islington Ave<span class=GramE>./</span>Queensway
    area of Toronto and was arrested after the attending police officer observed
    the usual symptoms of drinking – a strong smell of alcohol; unsteadiness on the
    feet; bloodshot and glassy eyes; and slurred speech.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After speaking with duty counsel, Mr. Paszczenko
    provided two samples of breath, registering 125 milligrams and 122 milligrams of
    alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  In
    the fashion of these cases, the readings were “truncated” – read down – to 120
    and 120, for purposes of the report.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that are not pertinent to the appeal, the
    samples (which are otherwise unchallenged) were not taken within two hours of
    when the offence was alleged to have occurred.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Because of this, the Crown was not entitled
    to rely upon the presumption set out in s. 258(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that the results of the
    breath tests were proof of the concentration of alcohol in Mr. Paszczenko’s
    blood at the time of the occurrence.  As
    a result, the Crown tendered an expert’s toxicology report that projected his
    blood alcohol content (“BAC”) to have been between “130” and “180” at the
    relevant time.  The report was filed in
    the form of an affidavit, pursuant to s. 657.3 of the <i>Code</i>.  The report’s author,
    James Wigmore, did not testify, nor did the defence seek to cross-examine him
    (as it was entitled to do) or to exclude his report.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Wigmore’s report framed the “several additional
    factors on which his estimate was based” – the four assumptions generalized
    above – in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. No large quantities of alcohol were consumed immediately prior to the collision
    (this is commonly referred to as “no bolus drinking”);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. No alcohol consumption took place after the collision prior to the Intoxilyzer
    tests;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. A rate of elimination of alcohol from the blood, which may range between 10 and
    20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood per hour; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. A plateau at the lower BAC estimation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the defence argued that the Court could not
    rely upon the expert’s report because assumptions (3) and (4) – the “rate of
    elimination” and the “plateau” – had not been proven.  Justice Cole refused to give effect to this
    argument, holding that to do so would cause much of the scheme for the
    admission of expert evidence in such cases “to fall by the wayside” and that
    this “[could] not be the intention of Parliament.”  In the absence of other evidence, he applied
    the best evidence rule to the report and accepted the calculations set out in
    it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge (“SCAJ”), Justice
    Kiteley, disagreed.  The principal issue
    argued before her was the requirement for proof of the fourth assumption
    concerning the “plateau.”  She concluded
    that there was no evidentiary basis upon which the trial judge could accept and
    rely upon that assumption.  She therefore
    set aside the conviction.  In doing so,
    she carefully and thoroughly canvassed the various conflicting authorities that
    have been decided both in the Ontario Court of Justice and the Superior Court
    of Justice.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts in Lima</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 2, 2006, Mr. Lima was arrested by a police
    officer on St. Clair Ave. W. in Toronto after failing a breath test
    administered through an approved screening device.  Mr. Lima also exhibited common indicia of
    drinking and driving; there was an odour of alcohol on his breath, his eyes
    were glassy and his speech slightly slurred.  He was taken to a police station where he provided two samples of his
    breath into an approved instrument, registering readings of 118 and 103 milligrams
    of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood (truncated to 110 and 100).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the need to contact and permit Mr. Lima to
    speak to a Portuguese language duty counsel, the tests were administered more
    than two hours after the occurrence in his case as well, and the Crown could
    not rely on the s. 258(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) presumption.  Again, the Crown filed an expert’s toxicology
    report, in accordance with s.&nbsp;657.3.  It projected Mr. Lima’s BAC to have been between “110” and “160” at the
    relevant time.  The report’s author,
    Patricia Solbeck, did not testify.  At trial,
    defence counsel did not contest the admissibility of the report, did not call
    evidence and did not seek to cross-examine the expert (as he, too, was entitled
    to do).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her report, Ms. Solbeck framed her “additional
    factors” – the four assumptions – in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. No rapid consumption of large
    quantities of alcoholic beverages shortly prior to the incident (commonly
    referred to as “no bolus drinking”);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. No consumption of
    alcoholic beverages after the incident and before the Intoxilyzer 5000C test;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. A rate of
    elimination of alcohol from the blood ranging from 10 to 20 milligrams of
    alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood per hour; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. Allowance for a plateau of up to two hours when
    using the lower rate of alcohol elimination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Justice Tuck-Jackson concluded that
    assumptions (1) and (2) required case-specific proof by the Crown and that,
    with respect to bolus drinking, this could be proved either through the absence
    of evidence of bolus drinking or through the absence of evidence that would undermine
    the common sense inference of drinking at a normal pace.  She concluded that the Crown had discharged
    its onus of proof on assumptions (1) and (2).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to assumptions (3) and (4), she was
    satisfied that the elimination rate and the plateau were information that was
    widely used and acknowledged within the report author’s area of expertise and
    could therefore form the basis of the expert’s opinion without any need to lead
    evidence to support it.  Even though Ms.
    Solbeck had not stated in her report that the two assumptions were widely used
    and acknowledged as reliable in her field, the trial judge accepted that she
    could rely on this evidence in the absence of any challenge by the
    accused.  She therefore convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ, Justice Clark, upheld the conviction.  Like the trial judge, he characterized the
    first two assumptions as fact and case-specific and the latter two as involving
    scientific propositions of general application.  It was conceded that there had been no post-arrest drinking, and the
    SCAJ concluded that there was “a sufficient body of circumstantial evidence”
    upon which the trial judge could have drawn the inference of no bolus
    drinking.  He was satisfied that
    assumptions (3) and (4) were matters within the toxicologist’s expertise and
    that, in the absence of some evidence to the contrary, the trial judge was
    entitled to rely on them without discounting them: see <i>R. v. S.A.B.</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 678, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    62.  In addition – relying upon the
    decision of this Court in <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Koh</span></i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 668 – he concluded that the Court
    could take judicial notice of facts previously found by other courts.  In <i>R.
    v. Phillips</i> (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 150, this Court accepted the same four
    assumptions that are at issue on this appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Leave to Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that leave to appeal should be granted
    in both cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each appeal raises essentially the same problem: what
    is the Crown required to prove in order to be able to rely upon the standard
    assumptions contained in expert toxicologist reports submitted under s. 657.3
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in relation to a
    driver’s BAC at the time of arrest when the Crown is precluded from relying
    upon the presumption contained in s. 258(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c)?  This is a question of law and raises an issue
    of general application and importance to the administration of justice,
    particularly in view of the conflicting jurisprudence presently existing in the
    lower courts on this subject.  See <i>R. v. R<span class=GramE>.(</span>R.)</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore grant leave to appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two appeals focused on the proof of different
    assumptions.  In <i>Lima</i>, the principal attack was on the proof required to establish the
    “no bolus drinking” assumption, although proof of the “plateau” and the
    “elimination rate” assumptions was also in play.  The <i>Paszczenko</i> appeal centred on proof of the two latter assumptions, with particular
    attention paid to the plateau hypothesis.  I shall deal with these issues separately, but first I turn to a review
    of some general considerations relating to proof in this context.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>General
    Considerations of Proof</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There can be no dispute that the onus is on the Crown
    to prove the facts underlying the expert’s report, including the assumptions
    upon which the expert relies.  As Sopinka
    J. noted in <i>R. v. Lavallee</i>,<i> </i>[1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, at p. 898: “before
    any weight can be given to an expert’s opinion, the facts upon which the
    opinion is based must be found to exist.”  See also, <i>R. v. Grosse</i> (1996),
    29 O.R. (3d) 785 at <span style='line-height:200%;
'>p. 790</span> (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1996]
    S.C.C.A. No. 465.  As noted above,
    however, the issue here is not <i>whether</i> the Crown must prove the assumptions, but <i>how</i> it is required to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this respect – as the SCAJ in <i>Paszczenko </i>noted – the Ontario jurisprudence in the courts below
    falls into two categories.  The first
    group of authorities requires that all four of the standard assumptions on
    which the toxicologist opinion is based be proved by case-specific evidence:
    see, for example, <i>R. v. Castro-Mendoza </i>(November
    25, 2004), Toronto (Ont. C.J.);<i> R. v.
    Hansraj</i>,<i> </i>[2003] O.J. No. 3746
    (C.J.);<i> R. v. Lin, </i>2007 ONCJ 312;<i> R. v. Virk,</i> [1999] O.J. No. 5524
    (C.J.); <i>R. v. Nauss,</i> [2003] O.J. No.
    5943 (C.J.); and<i> R. v. Thompson, </i>[2007]
    O.J. No. 1204 (C.J.).<b>  </b>The second group of authorities holds
    that the assumptions about elimination rates and the plateau differ from the
    assumptions regarding drinking before and after the incident in terms of the
    proof required, and that the elimination rate and plateau assumptions are
    matters of scientific knowledge on which the expert is entitled to rely without
    further proof by the Crown: see, <i>R. v.
    Kim,</i> 2007 ONCJ 488; <i> R. v. Lima,</i> 2009 CanLII 49638 (Ont. S.C.);<i> R. v. <span class=SpellE>Calabretta</span>, </i>2008 ONCJ 27, <span class=SpellE>aff’d</span> [2008] O.J. No. 4188 (S.C.);<i> R. v. Rajeswaran,</i> [2003] O.J. No. 2210
    (C.J.); and <i>R. v. Pucknell, </i>[2000]
    O.J. No. 3512 (S.C.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the latter line of jurisprudence represents
    the proper approach.  It is consistent
    with that taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class=SpellE><i>Lavallee</i></span> and in <i>S.A.B.</i>, where the distinction is made between
    “evidence that an expert obtains and acts upon within the scope of his or her
    expertise” and “evidence that an expert obtains from a party to the
    litigation”: <i>S.A.B.</i>, at paras. 62-63<span
class=GramE>.  In</span> the toxicology
    report context, this distinction has been described as the difference between
    “foundation facts” that must be proven in evidence (bolus drinking and
    post-incident drinking have been held to fall into this category), and
    information acted upon by an expert obtained as a result of his or her
    expertise (the elimination rate and plateau assumptions have been held to fall
    into this category).  I agree with this
    distinction and accept as accurate the following statement by C. Brewer J. in <i>Kim</i>, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    12:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, it is also well established that an expert
    is entitled to rely on information that is widely used and acknowledged as
    reliable within that field and that is employed as an accepted means of making
    decisions within that area of expertise: see <i>R. v. Zundel</i> (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) at 146; <i>R. v. Lavallee, supra</i>, per Sopinka J.,
    concurring, at 132; <i>R. v. Terceira</i> (1997), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.) at 37-39.  <i>This
    information may form a basis for the expert’s opinion without any need to lead
    evidence to support it</i>.  <i> </i>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Calabretta</i></span>, then Associate Chief Justice J.D. Wake came to a
    similar conclusion, at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nevertheless, accepting
    that there must be a basis for all four assumptions it seems that there is a
    difference between the first two assumptions and the latter two.  The first two assumptions, (bolus drinking)
    (no drinking after offence) are clearly matters of fact for the trial judge to
    determine on the evidence or lack thereof presented at the trial.  The latter two assumptions (rate of
    elimination) and (allowance for a plateau) are really matters of science upon
    which an expert should be able to rely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Langdon, the SCAJ in <i>Calabretta</i>, also accepted this analysis, at paras. 9-11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An expert is entitled to refer to sources within his or
    her field to explain and support the conclusions drawn: <i>S.A.B., </i>at para. 63.  I
    conclude, therefore, that in the absence of a challenge to the expert,
    assumptions 3 (the elimination rate) and 4 (the plateau) need not be proved by case-specific
    evidence led at trial to support them, other than the expert’s toxicological
    report filed pursuant to s. 657.3 of the <i>Code</i>.
     Assumptions 1 (no bolus drinking) and 2 (no
    post-incident drinking) require case-specific proof.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
    “No Bolus Drinking” Assumption</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Bolus drinking” is generally meant to describe the
    consumption of large quantities of alcohol immediately or shortly before
    driving: see <i>Grosse</i>, at <span
style='line-height:200%;'>p.
    788</span>; <i>R. v. Hall</i> (2007), 83
    O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at para. 14.  See
    also <i>Phillips</i> at pp. 158-162, for a
    description of the “relatively rare” phenomenon, although not by the “no bolus
    drinking” name.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In establishing that an accused has not engaged in
    bolus drinking, the Crown is in the unenviable position of having to prove a
    negative.  But how does it meet that onus
    in circumstances where – as is likely in many cases – it has no statement or
    evidence from the accused as to his or her drinking pattern at the relevant
    time and no other witnesses or  evidence
    to shed any light on that issue?  That is
    the dilemma posed, principally, by the <i>Lima </i>appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At one level, the answer is straightforward: the Crown
    need do very little.  The toxicologist’s
    report is premised – amongst other things – on there being <u>no</u> bolus
    drinking.  In the absence of <u>something</u> on the record to suggest the contrary, on what basis could a trier of fact
    conclude there <u>was</u> bolus drinking?  This Court has answered the question posed by concluding that triers of
    fact may resort to a common sense<u> </u>inference in such circumstances, namely,
    that people do not normally ingest large amounts of alcohol just prior to, or
    while, driving: see <i>Grosse, Hall, </i> and <i>R.
    v. <span class=SpellE>Bulman</span>,</i> 2007 ONCA 169.  As noted above, bolus drinking has been said
    to be a “relatively rare” phenomenon: <i>Phillips</i>,
    at pp. 158-162.  “No bolus drinking” is
    therefore largely a matter of common knowledge and common sense about how
    people behave. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Grosse</i>, at
    p. 792, the Court said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial
    judge was also entitled to consider that it was inherently unlikely that the
    respondent, in the space of less than 30 minutes, before embarking on his trip
    home to Brampton would consume the equivalent of nine ounces of alcohol.  This was not a matter of taking judicial
    notice of drinking patterns but merely <i>applying
    common</i> <i>sense as to how </i>ordinary
    people behave. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And in <i>Bulman </i>and <i>Hall</i>, respectively, Justices Gillese
    and LaForme observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><i><u>Bulman</u></i>, para.</span> 13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The jury was aware that [the toxicologist’s] expert
    testimony was dependent on an underlying assumption that had to be proven by
    the Crown – namely, that the appellant had not consumed a large quantity of
    alcohol shortly before driving (“bolus drinking”).  Whether [the expert’s] underlying assumption
    was proven was a question of fact for the jury to decide.  In making this finding, the jurors were
    entitled to rely upon their common sense, and to draw inferences about how
    normal people behave.  A reasonable
    inference is that normal people do not consume large quantities of alcohol
    shortly before, or while, driving.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><i><u>Hall</u></i>, para.</span> 20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There can be no doubt that the trial judge rejected
    his evidence on this issue entirely [i.e., the evidence of a defence witness to
    the effect that the accused had consumed half a glass of beer quickly just
    before leaving a restaurant].  Having
    done so, there was no evidence whatsoever of bolus drinking, nor was there any
    other evidence to undermine the common-sense inference of drinking at a normal
    pace, on which the trial judge was therefore entitled to rely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would frame the rationale for this approach as the
    imposition of a practical evidentiary burden on the accused, not to persuade or
    convince the trier of fact that there was bolus drinking involved, but to point
    to <i>something</i> in the evidence (either
    in the Crown’s case, or in evidence led by the defence) that at least puts the
    possibility that the accused had engaged in bolus drinking in play. The
    imposition of a practical evidentiary burden to come forward with evidence is
    simply another way of explaining the invitation to draw a common sense
    inference which puts the accused in essentially the same spot if he or she
    cannot point to some evidence to overcome either hurdle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Grosse</i> was
    also a case involving proof of the bolus drinking assumption underlying a
    toxicologist’s “over 80” opinion.  In
    rejecting a Crown argument resting on the difficulty of proving a negative and
    urging that there should be an onus on the accused to show the consumption of
    large quantities of alcohol just prior to the  incident – particularly since this information is private to the accused
    – the Court said at p. 790:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>      </span>[Counsel
    for the Crown] argued that the amount of alcohol consumed is a matter
    peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused and it is fair that the accused
    have <i>the burden of proof</i> of this
    issue.  We assume that [he] is suggesting
    that there be only an evidentiary burden on the accused, not a persuasive
    burden.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>      </span>In
    our view this argument must also be rejected.  In effect [the Crown] would have us create <i>a common law presumption</i>, in a case such as this, that in the
    absence of evidence to the contrary an accused against <span class=GramE>whom</span> expert evidence of blood-alcohol level is tendered <i>is deemed</i> not to have consumed large quantities of alcohol
    immediately before providing a breath sample.  There is no basis for creating such an extraordinary presumption.  Parliament has by statute created a
    presumption to assist the Crown in proof of the blood-alcohol level at the time
    of the alleged offence.  That
    presumption, however, is based on proof of a number of facts including proof
    that the tests were taken within two hours of the alleged offence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>      </span>It
    would <i>not be appropriate for the courts
    to broaden the scope of the statutory presumption</i> when the carefully
    created conditions in s. 258 cannot be met.  Where the Crown cannot rely upon the presumption in s. 258(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c) it must prove its case in the ordinary way. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The common law presumption advocated by the Crown and
    rejected by the Court in <i>Grosse</i>, is
    not the same as the practical evidentiary burden to come forward with some
    evidence that arises through the application of the common sense inference
    described above.  In <i>Grosse</i>, the Court spoke of the accused having the<i> burden of proof on the issue</i> and of the
    potential <i>creation of a presumption of
    law </i>that would <i>deem</i> no bolus
    drinking to be proven in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  This is the language of persuasion.  Here, the effect of the evidentiary shift is
    not to require the accused to convince the trier of fact of anything, but
    simply to be able to point to <i>some</i> evidence on the basis of which it can be said the issue of bolus drinking is alive
    on the record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chief Justice Dickson distinguished between a
    persuasive burden (which, constitutionally, cannot be shifted to the accused)
    and an evidentiary burden (which in some circumstances may be) in <i>R. v. Schwartz</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443.  He pointed out that the former requires proof
    of the existence of a certain set of facts whereas the latter does not require
    the party with the evidential burden to convince the trier of anything.  At p. 466, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Judges
    and academics have used a variety of terms to try to capture the distinction
    between the two types of burdens. … I prefer to use the terms “persuasive
    burden” to refer to the requirement of proving a case or disproving defences,
    and <i>“evidential burden” to mean the
    requirement of putting an issue into play by reference to evidence before the
    court</i>. The party who [page 467] has the persuasive burden is required to
    persuade the trier of fact, to convince the trier of fact that a certain set of
    facts existed. Failure to persuade means that the party loses. <i>The party with an evidential burden is not
    required to convince the trier of fact of anything, only to point out evidence
    which suggests that certain facts existed</i>. The phrase “onus of proof”
    should be restricted to the persuasive burden, since an issue can be put into
    play without being proven.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons explained above, applying the common
    sense inference where there is no evidence of bolus drinking in circumstances
    where the Crown is required to prove the negative (i.e., <u>no</u> bolus
    drinking) is simply an example of the <i>Schwartz</i> notion of an evidential burden, in my view.  It does not involve attaching an onus of proof to the accused or the
    creation of a presumption or deeming provision in the sense forbidden in <i>Grosse</i>.  On that basis, it would be more straightforward, it seems to me, to
    refer to this evidentiary exercise as a shift in the practical evidentiary
    burden on the basis of which – absent <i>something</i> to put bolus drinking in play – an inference may (but not must) be drawn.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, the Court in <i>Grosse</i> resolved the issue before it by resorting to the common
    sense inference that normal people do not ingest large amounts of alcohol
    shortly before getting into their car and driving.  This Court has adopted that same technique in <i>Hall</i> and <i>Bulman</i>.  That common sense
    inference was available to the trial judge and the SCAJ in Mr. Lima’s case, and
    particularly so in view of the following factors:</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that Mr. Lima was exhibiting signs of
    intoxication while driving and immediately after exiting the vehicle, while not
    conclusive, provides some circumstantial evidence of the absence of bolus
    drinking, in my view.  The effect of
    bolus drinking is to create a situation where the accused driver’s BAC may have
    been below 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood at the time of
    the incident, yet still register “over 80” in a read-back calculation done later
    because it was still rising at the time of the incident.  If the BAC were less than 80 at the time of
    the incident, one would not expect to see such indicia of intoxication.  This is circumstantial evidence tending to
    support the view that there was no bolus drinking in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given these facts, together with the application of the
    common sense inference, the trial judge was entitled to conclude, as she did,

lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The “Plateau” and “Elimination Rate” Assumptions</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-accepted in the case law and in the forensic
    science literature (a) that the elimination of alcohol from the body generally
    continues at a relatively constant rate which ranges from approximately 10 to
    approximately 20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood per hour,
    and (b) that, after rising rapidly within approximately 30 minutes of the last
    drink, a person’s BAC will remain at a relatively constant plateau for
    approximately two hours, before declining at the foregoing rate.  See <i>Phillips</i> and the academic legal and scientific literature relied on therein.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    v. Gibson; R. v. MacDonald,</i> [2008] 1 S.C.R. 397, <i>per</i> Charron J. at paras. 8 and 11, and <i>per </i>Deschamps J. (dissenting, but not on this point), at paras. 85,

    2009), at 29-6, 29-8 and 29-9.  Indeed,
    in <i>Gibson/MacDonald</i>, Deschamps J.
    would have held that accepting an average rate of elimination of 15 milligrams per
    100 millilitres of blood per hour “…would amount only to acknowledging the
    factual findings of trial judges across the country” (para. 88).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is therefore ample support in authoritative forensic
    science and legal fields for the conclusion that the elimination rate and the
    plateau assumptions found in the expert toxicology reports of Mr. Wigmore and
    Ms. Solbeck were not purely assumptions, but were assertions of scientific
    knowledge based upon matters within their field of expertise and, accordingly,
    need not be specifically proven.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Paszczenko</i>,
    the SCAJ attempted to distinguish the <i>S.A.B.</i> differentiation between “foundation” facts and “scientific” facts from this
    case on several bases which I find unhelpful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she concluded that in <i>S.A.B.</i> and in many of the lower court decisions accepting the
    distinction, there was no “challenge to the expert” whereas in <i>Paszczenko</i> there was such a challenge
    because defence counsel attacked various aspects of the toxicology report in
    his submissions.  Unlike the SCAJ,
    however, I do not accept that the type of “challenge to the expert” as
    contemplated in <i>S.A.B.</i> consists of an
    attack on the alleged frailties of the expert’s report during argument at the
    close of the case.  Such an attack may be
    successful in some cases where there are apparent weaknesses in the report, to
    be sure.  But the type of “challenge to
    the expert” contemplated in the jurisprudence that would counter the expert’s
    assumptions and opinion is in my view an evidentiary challenge made by way of
    cross-examination of the Crown’s expert (giving the expert an opportunity to
    explain, retract, elaborate or clarify his or her report) or by calling
    contradictory defence expert evidence.  The Crown may then re-examine, call reply evidence or cross-examine the
    defence expert and the matter will unfold as proof generally does during a
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the SCAJ found a difference between the <span
class=GramE>type</span> of scientific knowledge relied upon by the expert in <i>S.A.B.</i> – “international guidelines”
    relied upon by the expert in that case in rejecting a mutated DNA sample – and
    the “plateau” in this case.  She
    concluded that the international guidelines were widely accepted in the
    scientific community.  Respectfully, I
    see little difference.  For the reasons
    articulated above, I am of the view that the notion of an approximate two-hour
    plateau in the elimination rate of alcohol in the blood stream has long been
    well-established in both the judicial and scientific worlds.  Justice Deschamps’ comment in <i>Gibson/MacDonald</i>, cited above, reflects
    this view, as does the agreed statement of facts and the analysis in <i>Phillips</i>.  Moreover, it would appear from that analysis
    that the two-hour plateau forms the very basis for the s. 258(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c) presumption that breathalyzer readings taken within two
    hours of when the offence was alleged to have been committed are conclusive
    evidence of the accused’s BAC at the time of the incident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reality is that if the expert did not rely on the
    assumption of a plateau, the result would be even worse for Mr.
    Paszczenko.  Without allowing for the
    plateau, the effect of the elimination rate would be to elevate his BAC
    readings at the time of the accident because there would be two additional
    hours of elimination resulting in a “read-back” BAC of at least 20 milligrams per
    100 millilitres higher.  See <i>Phillips</i>, at pp. 160-161; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Versage</span></i>,
    2008 ONCJ 80, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As outlined above, similar observations apply with
    respect to the “elimination rate” assumption, attacked in both appeals.  </p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Shortfalls
    of the Reports</span></u><span lang=EN-US> </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr. North and Mr. Zoppi both argued on behalf
    of their clients that there were shortfalls in the expert reports themselves –
    a definitional uncertainty, they say – as a result of which the courts should
    conclude the assumptions had not been established on the record.  Counsel point out that the ability of the
    Crown – or, for that matter, the defence – to provide expert toxicology
    evidence by way of a report, pursuant to s. 657.3 of the <i>Code</i>, is an exception to the normal way in which evidence must be
    presented at trial.  The procedure is
    sometimes referred to as a “procedural short cut”, but <span class=GramE>counsel
    argue</span> it should not become an “evidentiary short cut”: the reports
    should not be “bare bones”, but should have an explanation as to the meaning of
    the assumptions and why such assumptions are made.  The “over 80” offence is, after all, a
    criminal offence; the accused is presumed to be innocent, and the Crown must
    prove its case with respect to all matters affecting criminal responsibility: <i>R. v. Whyte</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with these sentiments as far as they go, and it
    might well have been preferable if the reports here in question had been fuller
    in their explanations.  However, as
    explained below, I would not conclude that the reports are entitled to no
    weight in these circumstances as a result of their somewhat abbreviated nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of Mr. Paszczenko, Mr. North submitted that
    the description of the “plateau” assumption in the toxicology report was simply
    inadequate to constitute evidence supporting the assumption, even on the theory
    that Mr. Wigmore was entitled to rely on scientific knowledge gained in the
    course of working in his field of expertise.  The fourth assumption was described as “[a] plateau at the lower BAC estimation,”
    with no further explanation.  Mr. North
    says that is a meaningless phrase.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He points out that since the Paszczenko trial, the
    toxicology reports from the Centre of Forensic Sciences (with which Mr. Wigmore
    is associated) have been amended to provide a clearer and more meaningful
    description of the plateau factor.  The
    revised reports now state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>Allowance of a plateau of up to
    two hours.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A plateau in the BAC represents a period of time in
    which there is no significant change in the BAC due to the rate of absorption
    of alcohol into the body being approximately equal to the rate of elimination
    of alcohol from the body.  A plateau
    greater than two hours is rare.  A
    plateau of less than two hours will result in an increased BAC at the lower
    limit of the projected range.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the revised statement is preferable to the
    abridged version provided by Mr. Wigmore in the present toxicology report (although
    even the revised report does not state that the plateau concept is widely used
    and acknowledged as reliable in this field of forensic toxicology).  The revised version does provide a simple and
    brief explanation of what the “plateau” concept is and how it works.  However, in the circumstances, I would not give
    effect to the argument that Mr. Wigmore’s fourth assumption was so inadequately
    framed here – because there was no evidence of what the phrase means or any
    evidence to suggest that the notion of a plateau even exists – that no weight
    could be given to the assumption (and, therefore, to Mr. Wigmore’s opinion).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as I have explained above, the concept of a
    “plateau” is well-accepted in the field of forensic science and has been
    recognized as such in the jurisprudence at least since the decision of this
    Court in <i>Phillips</i>.  Secondly, there is no definitional
    uncertainty in the meaning of the word “plateau”.  It means what it says: the thing being
    measured is not rising or falling during the period mentioned.  The thing being measured is the blood alcohol
    concentration.  In short, during the
    “plateau” period, the assumed elimination rate is not being factored into the
    read-back calculation.  As noted above, <i>any</i> plateau factor favours the accused;
    thus, whatever vagueness may arise from the words “at the lower BAC estimation”
    is of little real consequence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, as the SCAJ in <i>Paszczenko</i> noted and the recent revised version of the toxicology
    report confirms, there has long been a standard form of presentation for these
    types of reports in these types of cases.  They all refer to the same four factors or assumptions.  Courts and counsel are familiar with
    them.  I am satisfied that, in the
    circumstances of this case, the short form reference to a “plateau at the lower
    BAC estimation” was sufficient to signal that Mr. Wigmore’s assumption related
    to the well-recognized two-hour plateau phenomenon (when using the lower rate
    of alcohol elimination) based upon the scientific knowledge gained within his
    field of expertise, and was therefore sufficient “evidence” to support that
    portion of his report in the absence of an evidentiary challenge by the
    defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Zoppi mounted his own definitional uncertainty
    attack on behalf of Mr. Lima in relation to the no bolus drinking assumption in
    Ms. Solbeck’s expert report.  To repeat,
    that assumption was expressed as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No rapid consumption of large quantities
    of alcoholic beverages shortly prior to the incident (commonly referred to as
    “no bolus drinking”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Zoppi argues that the report fails to define what
    “rapid consumption” or “shortly <span style='line-height:200%;'>before</span>” means or what
    quantity of alcohol would have to be consumed in what period of time to
    constitute “large quantities” and thereby establish bolus drinking.  Some judges in the lower courts – including
    the SCAJ in <i>Paszczenko</i> – have
    expressed similar reservations: see, for example, <i>Lin</i>.  There may be cases
    where more precision with respect to these concepts becomes necessary.  Suppose, for example, there was evidence that
    an accused had consumed 3 bottles of beer in the space of 20 minutes before the
    incident.  Would that constitute bolus
    drinking?  On the other hand, in <i>Grosse</i>, the evidence was that, in
    general, a person would have to consume the equivalent of 6 beers or 9 oz. of
    alcohol for bolus drinking to be a factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But judges are capable of understanding, in broad terms,
    what “rapid” consumption, “shortly before” and “large” quantities entail.  There is nothing on the record in either the <i>Lima</i> or the <i>Paszczenko</i> case to suggest <i>any</i> consumption of alcohol in the period prior to the respective incidents, much
    less “rapid” consumption of “large” quantities.  The lack of precision is therefore of little moment in these
    proceedings.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Judicial
    Notice</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Lima</i>, the
    SCAJ concluded that he could take judicial notice of the accuracy of the “plateau”
    and “elimination rate” assumptions, since this Court had already accepted those
    assumptions – based on essentially the same facts and described in the same
    fashion – in <i>Phillips</i>.  The SCAJ in <i>Paszczenko</i> refused to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is some debate in the jurisprudence about this.  For example,  in <i>R. v. Rajeswaran</i>, Duncan J.
    held that he was entitled to take judicial notice of the 10-20 milligram/hour elimination
    rate of alcohol in order to determine BAC at the time of driving, as did
    Langdon J. in <i>R. v. Coulter</i>, [2001]
    O.J. No. 5608 (S.C.J.).  On the other
    hand, trial judges in <i>R. v. Lin</i> (Lampkin J.), <i>R. v. Castro-Mendoza</i> (K. Caldwell J.), <i>R. v. Thompson</i> (C.H. Paris J.), and <i>R. v. Nauss</i> (Zivolak J.), held that they could not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is technically unnecessary to resolve this debate,
    given the analysis outlined above.  I am
    inclined to the view, however, that courts are entitled to take judicial notice
    (a) of the fact that the majority of human beings eliminate alcohol in a range
    of 10-20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood per hour, and (b)
    of the fact that, after rising relatively quickly during the first 30 minutes
    or so after the last drink, a person’s BAC generally hits a plateau for a
    period of up to two hours during which time the absorption rate and the
    elimination rate remain about equal and the BAC neither rises nor falls.  I think this view is consistent with the
    evolving jurisprudence and with the experience of hundreds of trial judges
    across the country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Koh</i>,
    Finlayson J.A. concluded, at p. 679, that “judicial notice may be taken of two
    kinds of fact: facts which are so notorious as not to be the subject of dispute
    amongst reasonable persons; and facts that are capable of immediate and
    accurate demonstration by resorting to readily accessible sources of indisputable
    accuracy.”  Moreover, “judicial notice is
    permissible where previous courts have proven a certain fact.”  See also Sopinka, Lederman &amp; Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2009), at paras. 19.13 <span class=GramE>and</span> 19.17.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Phillips</i>,
    this Court dealt extensively with the underlying facts regarding the absorption
    and elimination of alcohol into and out of the blood and the measurement of
    BAC.  It did <span class=GramE>so on</span> the basis of an agreed statement of facts and the scientific basis underpinning
    those facts.  Speaking for the Court,
    Blair J.A. stated at p. 160:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Scientists have established that the BAC rises
    rapidly, as stated in paras. <span class=GramE>5 and 6 of the agreed statement
    of facts, to a maximum or near maximum within approximately 30 minutes of the
    last drink.</span>  Thereafter, it
    remains relatively constant for a period of two hours after the alleged offence
    and then declines as alcohol is eliminated from the blood at the rate of 10 to
    20 mg per 100 ml of blood per hour.  In
    graphical terms BAC is often described as a sharply ascending curve in the
    first 30 minutes after consumption of the last drink, a plateau of
    approximately two hours and a gradually descending curve thereafter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The one exception to the foregoing conclusion, Blair
    J.A. noted, was the “relatively rare cases where there has been both a large
    amount of alcohol consumed within a few minutes prior to the apprehended
    driving and where the Breathalyzer tests are commenced within about 30 minutes
    of the last alcohol consumption.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These conclusions were well-founded on the scientific
    literature and studies in the forensic toxicology field, to which the Court had
    been referred and which it referenced.  There is no evidence here that the scientific evidence has changed since <i>Phillips</i> was decided.  Indeed, as I noted earlier in these reasons, in <i>Gibson/MacDonald</i>, <i>supra, </i><span class=SpellE>Deschamps</span> J. would have held that accepting an average rate of elimination of 15 milligrams
    per 100 millilitres of blood per hour (the mid-range between 10-20 milligrams) “…would
    amount only to acknowledging the factual findings of trial judges across the
    country.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In principle, therefore, I see no impediment to judges
    taking judicial notice of both the “plateau” and “elimination rate” assumptions
    underlying the expert toxicologist’s reports.  They are assumptions, with underlying facts, that “are capable of
    immediate and accurate demonstration by resorting to readily accessible sources
    of indisputable accuracy” in the scientific field of forensic toxicology and in
    the jurisprudence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the Crown’s
    appeal in the <i>Paszczenko</i> matter, set
    aside the order for a new trial and restore Mr. Paszczenko’s conviction.  I would dismiss Mr. Lima’s appeal.</p>
