    of a civil action that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> brought shortly

    driving a motor vehicle without displaying two licence plates.  Officers Parker and <span class=SpellE>Koscinski</span> were also in the courtroom that day.  Officer Parker testified at Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Penner’s</span> trial; officer <span class=SpellE>Koscinski</span> was there on an unrelated

    at the hearing.  Numerous exhibits were
    filed, including a videotape of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> taken at
    the police station during the timeframe he was allegedly assaulted, and 13
    photographs of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> following his arrest.  These photographs showed scrapes and bruising
    on Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner’s</span> face, a blackened eye, scrapes on his

    at the hearing was whether the police officers had the legal authority to
    arrest an individual in the courtroom.  The hearing officer found the law on this issue to be unclear.  He resolved the issue by holding that the
    prosecution had the onus of showing that the arrest was not authorized by
    statute and that the prosecution had not met its burden.  </span></p>

    found that the officers had not used unnecessary force in arresting Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Penner</span>.  In making
    this finding, the hearing officer relied on the evidence of independent witnesses,
    who testified that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> resisted arrest.  Third, the hearing officer found that the
    police officers had not used unnecessary force on Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> at the police station.  In making this

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> appealed the hearing officer’s decision to the Commission.  The appeal was heard by the Chair and a
    member of the Commission.  The Commission
    held that the hearing officer had erred by failing to determine whether the
    police officers had the lawful authority to arrest Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> in the courtroom without being directed to do so by the presiding Justice of
    the Peace.  Although not excusing Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Penner’s</span> conduct, the Commission went on to hold that “his
    arrest … was both unlawful and unnecessary and that accordingly any force used
    was unjustified.”  The Commission also
    held that the hearing officer’s finding of no unnecessary force at the police
    station was “both correct and proper in law.”  Still, the Commission found both Parker and <span class=SpellE>Koscinski</span> guilty of unnecessary or unlawful exercise of authority.</span></p>

    judicial review of the Commission’s decision.  Their application was granted.  The Divisional Court held that the Commission erred in law by holding that
    the hearing officer ought to have determined whether the officers had the legal
    authority to arrest Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> in the courtroom.  The Divisional Court was of the view that the
    powers of the police and the powers of the Justice of the Peace could
    coexist.  It was unnecessary to decide
    which was paramount in this case because the officers’ actions did not conflict
    with those of the presiding Justice of the Peace.  </span></p>

    the Divisional Court upheld the hearing officer’s findings of fact and restored
    his decision.  The court held that there

lang=EN-US>.  The disciplinary
    proceedings were held to determine whether the two police officers were guilty
    of misconduct.  Those proceedings had no
    direct consequences for Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span>.  In the civil action, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> seeks compensation for the actions of the officers.  I agree with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> that the legislature did not intend to foreclose his civil action simply
    because he filed a complaint under the <i>Police
    Services Act</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

lang=EN-US>.  A related consideration is
    that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> cannot benefit financially in the
    disciplinary proceedings.  The <i>Police Service Act</i> does not provide for
    compensation for a complainant, even for one whose complaint leads to a finding
    of misconduct.  This is an important
    consideration weighing against applying issue <span class=SpellE>estoppel</span>,
    but its strength is diminished by the potential indirect benefit to Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Penner</span> from the disciplinary proceedings.  If, for example, the hearing officer had
    found that the two police officers did not have reasonable and probable grounds
    to arrest Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> or used excessive force on him,
    those findings would likely have <span class=SpellE>estopped</span> the
    officers from asserting otherwise in Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner’s</span> civil action.  In other words, issue <span
class=SpellE>estoppel</span> works both ways.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, these two
    considerations – the different purposes of the two proceedings and the
    unavailability (or limited availability) of compensation in the administrative
    proceeding – will often be present when a party asks the court to exercise its
    discretion not to apply issue <span class=SpellE>estoppel</span> for findings
    made in an administrative hearing.  By
    themselves these considerations do not ordinarily resolve how the court should
    exercise its discretion.   Typically,
    other considerations come into play.  In
    this case, four considerations <span class=SpellE>favour</span> applying issue <span
class=SpellE>estoppel</span>:  the
    expertise of the decision maker, the procedures in the disciplinary
    proceedings, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner’s</span> active participation in
    those proceedings, and the right of appeal.  </span></p>

    maker</span></u><span lang=EN-US>.  The
    hearing officer was not legally trained; he was a retired police
    superintendent.  If the issues claimed to
    give rise to issue <span class=SpellE>estoppel</span> turned on, for example, a
    question of contract interpretation, then his lack of legal training would <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> not applying issue <span class=SpellE>estoppel</span>.  But the findings for which issue <span
class=SpellE>estoppel</span> is sought are reasonable and probable grounds for
    arrest and the use of excessive or unnecessary force.  For making these findings, a senior and
    experienced police officer has as much expertise as a court would have.  The one issue on which the hearing officer
    could claim no expertise – the legal authority of an officer to arrest a person
    in a courtroom – was resolved by the Divisional Court.</span></p>

    disciplinary proceedings</span></u><span lang=EN-US>.  In some of the cases where the court
    exercises its discretion not to apply issue <span class=SpellE>estoppel</span>,
    the administrative proceeding was intended as a quick and inexpensive way to
    obtain a decision and was often heard with a measure of urgency.  In those cases, many if not all of the
    procedural guarantees associated with a civil trial are not present.  Two examples are <span class=SpellE><i>Minott</i></span> and <span class=SpellE><i>Danyluk</i></span>.  That is not the case here.</span></p>

    witnesses testified over several days, and numerous exhibits were filed.  The witnesses were extensively

    standard of proof.  He points out that s.

    “clear and convincing evidence.”  That is
    a higher standard of proof than the standard of proof in a civil action, which
    is, of course, on a balance of probabilities.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span> argues that these two different

    specific.  In <i>Porter v. York Regional Police</i>, 2001 <span class=SpellE>CarswellOnt</span> 2030 the different standards of proof were decisive.  In that case, Hermiston J. relied on these
    different standards in exercising discretion not to apply issue <span

    was “unable to see any evidence whatsoever” that the officers used unnecessary
    or excessive force on Mr. <span class=SpellE>Penner</span>.  Instead, he found that their use of force was
