  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal results from a trial in which the jury was
    asked to assess the damages suffered by the appellants as a result of a motor
    vehicle accident for which the respondents admitted liability. After three
    weeks of evidence, and closing addresses by counsel, the respondents, who had
    delivered the jury notice, moved for a mistrial. The trial judge granted the
    order, finding that the cumulative effect of certain comments in the closing
    address of appellants’ trial counsel (not Mr. Evans or Ms. Hill) impaired trial
    fairness to an extent that could not be corrected by any charge she might give.
    In the absence of the respondents’ consent, the trial judge refused to decide
    the issue of damages herself and ordered a mistrial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the appellants argued that the trial
    judge erred in finding that trial counsel’s comments compromised trial fairness
    and could not be corrected by appropriate instructions. Secondly, the
    appellants say that, in any event, the trial judge erred in refusing to decide
    the question of damages herself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with these submissions. There is no
    doubt that, as Mr. Evans forcefully argued, trial counsel has the right, and
    indeed the duty, to advance the client’s cause fearlessly and with vigour and
    must be given considerable latitude in doing so, even to the point of
    extravagant declaration. But there are also important limits on the bounds of a
    closing address. See <i>Landolfi v. Fargione</i> (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 767 (C.A.), at para. 78. As difficult as it is, there is a
    line to be drawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In doing so here, the trial judge gave anxious and
    detailed consideration to all the various comments in counsel’s closing address
    that the respondents put forward as offensive, and provided clearly expressed
    reasons for her conclusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She found that a number of the improprieties, including
    misstating the onus of proof with respect to future losses, misstating the
    evidence, and inviting the jury to decide based on information not in evidence,
    could be cured by a correcting instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, there were a number of statements that she
    concluded could not be so corrected. These included appeals to the jury’s
    emotions, and asking the jury to decide the case based on counsel’s opinion of
    the evidence. For example, she expressed particular concern about counsel
    telling the jury that in making their decisions they should act on the basis of
    what they felt in their gut and in their heart and further, that their decision
    should be based on whether they would be able to look the plaintiff in the eye
    should they meet her on the street. The trial judge concluded that the
    statements, of which these are examples, particularly when taken cumulatively,
    were highly prejudicial and endangered trial fairness. There were simply too
    many to effectively correct. Her view was that any attempt to do so would only
    reinforce the emotional considerations already left with the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that it was open to the trial judge to find
    the comments were inflammatory and diverted the jury’s attention from deciding
    the issues in this case on the basis of the evidence and that they impaired the
    fairness of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While appellants’ counsel carefully took us through
    each of the comments one by one, focusing on each separately masks the reality
    that, as is often the case, it was the cumulative effect of the comments that
    caused the trial judge the greatest concern. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has been clear that considerable deference
    must be given to a trial judge’s assessment of whether counsel’s statements
    have impaired trial fairness and whether any correcting instruction is
    possible. The judge hearing the comments in the courtroom is best placed to
    assess their impact and whether the appearance and reality of trial fairness have
    been endangered so that correction by the appropriate charge is impossible. See <i>Fiddler v. Chiavetti</i> (2010), 317
    D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 385 (C.A.), at para. 48.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, we can see no basis to interfere with the
    assessment of the trial judge that a number of the statements in counsel’s
    closing address crossed the line and, taken together, carried an impact that
    she could not correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That conclusion necessitated dismissing the jury. Since
    the jury notice was served by the respondents, the decision by the trial judge
    to decline to decide damages herself was simply an appropriate recognition in
    the circumstances of this case that the respondents ought not to be deprived of
    their right to have this issue decided by a jury simply because of the
    transgressions of appellants’ trial counsel. We would not interfere with her
    decision to decline to decide the issue and order a mistrial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, despite Mr. Evans’ able argument, the
    appeal must be dismissed. Costs to the respondent fixed at $15,000 inclusive of
    disbursements and applicable taxes. </p>
