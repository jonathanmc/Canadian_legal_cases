  <p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The central issue on this appeal is whether there are
    errors in the trial judge’s ruling that a statement made by the appellant was
    proven by the Crown to be voluntary.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances surrounding the statement were
    unusual.  Early one November morning, the
    police executed a search warrant at an apartment in which the appellant was
    found. The search warrant was executed following the deployment of stun
    grenades by the Emergency Task Force.  The
    appellant and other occupants of the apartment, lightly clothed, were forced to
    the ground, handcuffed and then led outside the apartment into the hallway.  The officer in charge of the situation gave
    the appellant abbreviated information as to his right to counsel but did not
    caution the appellant as to his right to remain silent.  Windows were opened to clear smoke from the
    stun grenades and the temperature dropped.  The appellant and the other occupants were cold
    and shivering.  The police retrieved
    shoes and coats from the apartment.  The appellant
    did not identify any of the coats initially retrieved as belonging to him.  When asked where his coat was, the appellant
    told the officer that it was on a chair in the living room.  Another officer had previously found a firearm
    under the coat. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown sought to lead the appellant’s statement as
    to the location of his coat to link the appellant to the firearm.  The trial judge conducted a <i>voir dire</i> to determine its admissibility
    under both the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</i> and under the rule requiring the Crown to prove that it was
    made voluntarily.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that there was a breach of the
    appellant’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> right to
    counsel but that the breach was not a serious one as the appellant was given
    some information as to his right to counsel, and that the statement should be
    admitted pursuant to s. 24(2).  The trial
    judge also found that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    statement was voluntary.  He admitted the
    statement into evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of several counts,
    including possession of a loaded restricted weapon and careless storage of a
    firearm, and sentenced to 7 months imprisonment and 2 years probation in
    addition to time served of 14 months. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellant challenges both aspects of the
    trial judge’s ruling, we find that it is only necessary for us to deal with the
    issue of voluntariness.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we have concluded that
    there are three errors in the trial judge’s reasons that undermine his finding
    that the Crown proved that the statement was voluntary.  It follows, in our view, that the ruling
    cannot stand and that a new trial is required on the counts affected, namely
    count 3, possession of a loaded restricted firearm, and count 5, careless
    storage of a firearm.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1. The absence of a caution</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most significant shortcoming in the trial judge’s
    reasons as to voluntariness is the following finding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Brown was also provided with a caution,
    although not the full caution, which indicates that he would have an awareness
    of what was at stake when he indicated that his coat was in the living room,
    and when he further acknowledged that the coat brought out to him was indeed
    his.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the record and, in particular, from the
    evidence of the officer who dealt with the appellant at the scene, that the
    appellant was not cautioned before he made the statement concerning his coat.  The appellant was given partial information as
    to his right to counsel but the officer admitted that at no time did he caution
    the appellant of his right to remain silent or that any statement he made could
    be used in evidence against him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where, as here, the accused was detained, whether or
    not formally arrested and charged, the presence or absence of a caution is a
    factor, and in many cases an important factor, in answering the ultimate
    question of voluntariness.  This
    well-established principle was reiterated by Charron J. in <i>R. v. Singh,</i> [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405 at paras. 31 and 33.  The trial judge’s erroneous finding that a partial
    caution had been given was a legal error that had a direct bearing upon the
    issue of voluntariness.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2. The inducement to answer because of the cold</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was undisputed that the appellant was cold and
    shivering as he stood handcuffed in the hallway.  In his reasons dealing with the alleged <i>Charter</i> violation, the trial judge
    concluded that the appellant “would have expressed ownership of the subject
    coat simply because it was cold at the time of the early morning raid and on
    the evidence, Mr. Brown was cold.”  However, when it came to the issue of
    voluntariness, the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the
    appellant had answered the question about his coat because he was cold.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was handcuffed, thinly clothed and
    shivering after having been roused from sleep by a stun grenade.  The appellant was entirely in the control of
    the police, and, as found by the trial judge, he was motivated to answer the
    question about his coat by the fact that he was cold.  In our view, the trial judge erred by failing
    to take that finding into account in assessing the voluntariness of the
    statement.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3. Misapprehension of the evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Related to the second point is the trial judge’s finding
    that, before answering the question as to the whereabouts of his coat, the
    appellant had “already declined the offer of the other jackets in the closet,
    even the ones not claimed by his mates.”  This suggests that the appellant was offered a
    choice of means to escape the cold.  If
    that had been established, it would bear upon the voluntariness of his answer
    to the question about his coat.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant’s submission that the trial
    judge’s finding that the appellant “declined the offer of other jackets” indicates
    a misapprehension of the evidence.  The
    appellant was not offered other jackets.  A review of the record and of the evidence of
    the officers involved indicates that the procedure involving the provision of
    the coats to the occupants of the apartment was that a police officer brought
    the jackets from the closet one by one and asked the appellant and his
    confederates if any of them owned that jacket.  If no one claimed the jacket as his own, it
    was returned to the closet.  It was only
    after the supply of jackets from the closet had been exhausted that the
    appellant was asked as to the whereabouts of his jacket.  While perhaps not as significant as the other
    two errors, when considered as a whole, the trial judge’s ruling presents a misleading
    picture of what happened.  The appellant
    was not offered a selection of jackets from which he could choose to keep warm;
    the appellant was offered only one choice, namely, to identify the jacket that
    was his.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, these errors undermine the trial judge’s
    finding that the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt the voluntariness
    of the impugned statement. In the result, we allow the appeal, set aside the
    convictions on counts 3 and 5, and order a new trial.  The appellant has served the sentence and as
    the sentence appeal was not pursued in argument, leave to appeal sentence is
    denied.</p>
