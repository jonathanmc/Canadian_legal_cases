  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    October 8, 2003 at about 8:30 p.m., Janakan Sivalingam (the deceased) was set
    upon by a group of assailants who attacked him with baseball bats, an axe and a
    machete. His attackers emerged, with a number of other young men, from three
    vehicles that pulled up beside the parking lot of a mall where the deceased and
    his friends were congregating. The assailants were looking for another man,
    Lingathasan Suntharamoorthy (Pay) who turned out not to be there. The deceased and
    his friends fled when they were set upon. The deceased, who was a friend of
    Pay’s, ran towards the entrance of a high school across the road. Unfortunately,
    he was unable to escape and he was savagely attacked and died as a result of
    his wounds. His attackers then fled in three vehicles, one of which was a
    Pontiac Grand AM that had been rented by the girlfriend of a third co-accused,
    Gobinath (Gobi) Suntharalingam. The evidence implicating Gobi in the crime was
    weak and the jury acquitted him.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants were charged with first degree murder but the jury returned verdicts
    of second degree murder against both of them. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    was the primary position of the Crown that the appellants, along with others,
    had plotted to murder Pay and that in executing their <span class=GramE>plan,</span> they killed the deceased under the mistaken belief that he was Pay. Alternatively,
    the Crown maintained that when the appellants and their cohorts realized that
    Pay was not in the parking lot, they spontaneously chose to attack and kill the
    deceased, who was a friend of Pay, thereby rendering them liable for second
    degree murder. It is apparent from their verdicts that the jury accepted the
    second of these two scenarios.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant Palarajah testified. He admitted that he was present at the scene and
    acknowledged that he was among the assailants who surrounded the victim. He
    maintained, however, that his role was that of peacemaker and that he tried to
    stop his friends from assaulting the deceased when he realized that the
    deceased was not Pay.  He said that he
    accidentally received a wound to his foot during the melee.  He claimed that he and his friends had come
    to confront Pay but not to harm him. By its verdict, it is apparent that the
    jury rejected his evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant Ulaganathan did not testify.  There was both direct and circumstantial evidence placing him at the
    scene of the assault.  The appellant
    Palarajah provided direct evidence of his presence at the scene.  In his testimony, Palarajah identified
    Ulaganathan as the driver of the white Pontiac Grand AM.  Ulaganathan’s fingerprints were recovered
    from the rear view mirror and the outside front passenger door of the Pontiac.
    Other evidence established that after the assault, Ulaganathan drove the injured
    Palarajah and another man to the apartment occupied by Gobi’s girlfriend.  By its verdict, it is apparent that the jury
    concluded that Ulaganathan was a party to the murder. His role was to drive the
    assailants to the scene and then to further their escape by acting as the getaway
    driver.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONVICTION APPEALS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)       The trial
    judge’s instructions to the jury on reasonable doubt</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants maintain that the trial judge failed to provide the jury with
    meaningful instructions on reasonable doubt, particularly when he was
    distinguishing between proof beyond a reasonable doubt and proof on a balance
    of probabilities. They claim that the trial judge failed to link proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt with the notion of “being sure” or “certain” and that in using
    the numerical figure of 51% in describing proof on a balance of probabilities,
    he potentially confused the jury as to what percentage would establish proof
    beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellants further contend that in response to a
    request from the jury to clarify the meaning of reasonable <span class=GramE>doubt,</span> the trial judge erred by simply repeating, almost verbatim, his original
    instructions on reasonable doubt. They further claim that in responding to the
    jury’s question, the trial judge erred by failing to explicitly advise the jury
    that further clarification would be provided if required.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    would not give effect to these submissions. In our view, read as a whole, the
    trial judge’s instructions on reasonable doubt do not raise a concern that the
    jury would have misunderstood the correct criminal standard of proof.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his charge, the trial judge distinguished between proof on a balance of
    probabilities and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, saying:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Proof
    on a balance of probability, the lesser standard, is attained at 51% of
    possibility; whereas, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the criminal standard
    falls much closer to certainty than it does proof on a balance of probability.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>However,
    it is important to keep in mind that it is rarely possible to prove anything
    with absolute or mathematical certainty, and so the burden of proof on the
    Crown is to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but not – I repeat – but not beyond
    any conjectural or speculative doubt whatsoever.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    response to the jury’s question seeking further guidance on the concept of
    reasonable doubt, the trial judge repeated his initial instructions but added
    that “proof to a certainty is attained at 100% of possibility”.  With that addition, he repeated his original
    instruction that proof beyond a reasonable doubt falls much closer to a
    certainty than it does to proof on a balance of probabilities.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    light of the reinstruction, we see no merit in the appellants’ submission that
    the jury would have been confused about the numerical percentage needed to
    achieve proof beyond a reasonable doubt. While it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge added that the jury could only convict if they were “sure”
    that the accused were guilty, that instruction was not <span class=GramE>mandatory.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to the manner in which the trial judge responded to the jury’s
    question, on the facts of this case, it was perfectly proper for the trial
    judge to repeat essentially what he had told the jury in his original
    instructions.  In this respect, we note
    that the trial judge did not provide the jury with a copy of his charge and he
    was entitled to treat their question as a request to repeat his original
    instructions. Manifestly, the jury was aware that if confusion or concerns
    remained following the reinstruction, further clarification could be sought. This
    is apparent from the fact that shortly after the reinstruction, the jury asked
    for and received a written transcript of the trial judge’s reinstruction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the circumstances, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury
    misunderstood the proper standard of proof that was to be applied. Accordingly,
    this ground of appeal fails.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Instructions
    on the right of jurors to disagree</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge in his original instructions told the jury that they had the right
    to disagree.  The instruction in this
    regard was short and to the point but there is no reason to believe that it
    failed to serve its intended purpose.  None of the three defence counsel who <span class=GramE>were</span> present in the courtroom and listening to the charge raised an objection.  Had they, or any of them, been concerned that
    the jury may not have understood such a basic <span class=GramE>principle,</span> surely an objection would have been registered.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the course of deliberating, the jury asked a question, the essence of which was
    that while the jury knew it had to be unanimous to convict, did it also have to
    be unanimous to acquit.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge properly responded to that question. However, in doing so, he did
    not remind the jury that they had the right to disagree and not reach a
    verdict. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge’s response may have left the jury with
    the impression that they had to arrive at a verdict, one way or the other, and
    that they did not have the right to disagree should they be unable to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  In our view, the question posed had nothing to
    do with the jury’s right to disagree.  On
    the contrary, the jury simply wanted to know whether they had to be unanimous
    to return a verdict of acquittal – as they had to be to return a guilty
    verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    consider it implicit in the jury’s question that the jury was aware that they
    could disagree respecting the guilt of the accused but they were unclear
    whether such disagreement would lead to an acquittal, or whether unanimity was
    required to arrive at that result as well. The trial judge correctly answered
    the narrow question posed by the jury. Counsel at trial raised no objection to
    the trial judge’s response. Indeed, they appeared to agree with the wording of
    the trial judge’s answer. While a failure to object may not always be
    determinative, once again, the fact that three competent defence counsel were
    not concerned that the trial judge’s response may have left the jury with a
    misunderstanding about their right to disagree belies the appellants’
    suggestion, raised for the first time on appeal, that the jury may have been
    unclear on this crucial issue.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US> (3)      Instructions pertaining to the issue of mistaken
    identity of the victim</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge initially charged the jury that “mistaken identity or even
    ignorance of the deceased’s true identity is not a defence to murder”. However,
    after hearing submissions from counsel on the issue of mistaken identity and
    its relationship to planning and deliberation, the trial judge reinstructed the
    jury on this point. He explained to the jury that if the accused became aware
    that Pay was not at the mall parking lot and decided on the spur of the moment to
    kill one of his friends, then none of the accused could be guilty of first
    degree murder on the basis of planning and deliberation; rather, they could
    only be found guilty, at most, of second degree murder.  The jury was told that in order to find the
    accused guilty of first degree murder on the basis of planning and deliberation,
    it was necessary for the Crown to prove that in executing their plan, the
    accused believed that their intended victim was Pay. Defence counsel raised no
    objection to these clarifying instructions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the result, the jury found the appellants guilty of second degree murder. In so
    concluding, the jury must have been of the view that the killing of the
    deceased occurred in the context of a spontaneous change of plan when the assailants,
    including the accused, realized that Pay, their intended victim, was not
    present.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants submit for the first time on appeal that the trial judge failed to
    explain, in his clarifying instructions, how mistaken identity could lead to a
    conviction for manslaughter or a verdict of acquittal for an accused who did
    not participate directly in the assault but whose guilt stood to be determined
    on the basis of party liability.  The
    Crown acknowledges that if there was a spontaneous change of plan on the part
    of the principal assailants, as the jury apparently found, then the aiders and
    abettors, including the appellant Ulaganathan in his role as getaway driver,
    would only be guilty of second degree murder if they knew about the spur of the
    moment decision to kill the deceased and did something for the purpose of
    aiding the killing.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge did not provide further instructions on party liability; nor was he
    asked to do so. The Crown accepts that further instructions could have been
    given.  However, the Crown argues that
    they were not necessary because the jury had already been fully instructed on
    the various ways in which the non-assailants could be found liable as parties
    and there is no reason to believe that the jury did not apply those
    instructions in assessing the spontaneous killing scenario.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    agree with the Crown. The jury had all the tools it needed to properly assess
    the liability, if any, of those accused who did not participate directly in the
    assault but who aided or abetted the killing of the deceased. Importantly, both
    appellants took the position at trial that they knew that the person who was
    being assaulted was not Pay. The appellant Palarajah claimed that he interceded
    as a peacemaker when he realized that the deceased was not Pay. The jury
    obviously rejected his evidence to that effect. As for the appellant
    Ulaganathan, he remained at the scene while the assault took place and
    performed the role of getaway driver, thereby enabling the assailants to make
    good their escape. It was open to the jury to find that he did so purposefully,
    especially since there was nothing to suggest that he did anything different
    once he realized the assailants had decided to attack the deceased in place of
    Pay.  As such, the evidence amply
    substantiates his conviction for second degree murder as a party to the offence
    under ss. 21(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) and (c) of the <i>Code</i>. There is no reason to think that the jury did not follow this
    line of reasoning in convicting Ulaganathan of second degree murder.  Accordingly, we would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Instructions
    on the defence of abandonment</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant Palarajah’s primary position before the jury was that he intended no
    harm to Pay.  If the jury rejected this
    claim, Palarajah maintained that the defence of abandonment was open to him
    because when he realized that the deceased was not Pay, he took steps to
    prevent or terminate the attack on the deceased.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The trial judge left the defence of abandonment
    to the jury.  However, in doing so, he
    did not instruct the jury that the timely communication of an intention to
    withdraw should be considered in the context of what was “practical and
    reasonable” in the circumstances. Palarajah claims that this was an important
    aspect of his defence given the speed with which the others carried out their
    attack on the deceased.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> We would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal. The defence of abandonment was tenuous at best.  By its verdict, it is apparent that the jury
    rejected Palarajah’s evidence that he assumed the role of peacemaker and tried
    to stop the attack on the deceased.  On
    the contrary, the jury’s verdict conforms <span class=GramE>with</span> the
    evidence that placed Palarajah in the melee as one of the assailants.  Accordingly, on this record, even if the
    trial judge did err by failing to instruct the jury as Palarajah claims he
    should have, we would have no difficulty in applying the curative proviso to
    save the conviction. </span></p>

    any event, we are satisfied that the instructions that the jury received on the
    defence of abandonment were more favourable than Palarajah deserved and more
    than make up for the alleged deficiency in the trial judge’s instructions.  In concluding his instructions on the defence
    of abandonment, the trial judge stated as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown must satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt – this relates to an essential
    matter – the Crown must satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
    Mr. Palarajah did not yell out “police”, or if he did so, that it did not
    constitute a timely communication to his fellow common intenders of his
    withdrawal from the assault of Janakan Sivalingam.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    we read that instruction, the trial judge effectively told the jury that if
    they were satisfied or had a reasonable doubt that Palarajah yelled out
    “police”, as he claimed he had, so that the assailants would stop attacking the
    deceased, then the Crown would have failed to negative the defence of
    abandonment and Palarajah should be acquitted.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect, that instruction was overly favourable to Mr. Palarajah and probably
    wrong in law. Nonetheless, by its verdict, it is apparent that the jury
    rejected Palarajah’s evidence even on this limited matter. Accordingly, this
    ground of appeal also fails.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    disagree. The trial judge fairly characterized the murder of an innocent
    “surrogate victim” as “terrifying and outright chilling”. He was satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Palarajah was one of the assailants who actually
    killed the deceased. He took into account Palarajah’s character, the nature of
    the offence and its surrounding circumstances, as well as the jury’s
    recommendations. In the end, despite the appellant’s age (23) and his prospects
    for rehabilitation, the trial judge found that the brutal murder of an innocent
    bystander amounted to egregious conduct and demonstrated a “high order of moral
    culpability”.</span></p>

    the Crown that in all the circumstances, the trial judge exercised his

    parole eligibility from 10 to 17 years.  In sum, we see no basis for appellate intervention.</span></p>
