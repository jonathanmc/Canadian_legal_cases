  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party, Hakim Optical, leases space from the
    responding party, 1570710 Ontario, under an offer to lease.  The term of Hakim’s lease ends tomorrow,
    September 30, 2010.  The offer to lease
    gives Hakim an option to extend the lease on written notice, which it has
    given.  However, the option to extend is
    qualified.  It provides: “This option to
    extend shall be granted provided the lesser has not given the lessee notice
    that the lessor plans to redevelop the site.”  On April 20, 2010, the responding party, the landlord, gave Hakim notice
    that “we are terminating on the basis of the redevelopment clause <span
class=GramE>… .”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hakim applied for relief from forfeiture under s. 20 of
    the <i>Commercial Tenancies Act</i>.  It contended that the moving party’s notice
    was premature and defective.  Pollak J.
    dismissed the application.  Hakim has
    appealed her decision to this court.  It
    now moves before me under r. 63.02(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> for a stay of
    Pollak J.’s decision pending the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The landlord raised my jurisdiction to grant relief to
    Hakim.  The landlord contends that Hakim
    does not seek a stay of the order under appeal because there is nothing to stay.  Instead, the landlord contends, Hakim in
    substance seeks an injunction to prevent the landlord from taking possession of
    the leased premises pending the appeal.  The landlord submits that I have no jurisdiction under r. 63 to grant
    injunctive relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the landlord that a stay of the order
    dismissing its application for relief is of no benefit to Hakim.  See <i>Re <span
class=SpellE>Apotex</span> Inc. and Attorney General for Ontario</i>, [1986]
    O.J. No. 250.  As the landlord points
    out, what Hakim really asks for is an interim injunction preventing the
    responding party from entering the leased premises pending appeal.  I also agree with the landlord that r. 63
    does not give me jurisdiction to grant an injunction pending appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I do have jurisdiction to grant an interim
    injunction under s. 134(2) of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, which authorizes this court, on motion, to “make any
    interim order that is considered just to prevent prejudice to a party pending
    the appeal”.  The jurisdiction conferred
    on the court under s. 134(2) may be exercised by a single judge.  See s. 7(2) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I have jurisdiction to grant Hakim’s relief, I
    decline to do so for two reasons.  First,
    I see little merit in Hakim’s appeal.  Hakim’s argument that the landlord’s notice is premature because it does
    not yet have permits for its redevelopment was thoroughly considered and
    rejected by the motion judge.  I agree
    with her analysis.  As she noted, the
    offer to lease does not condition the landlord’s notice on the existence of
    permits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hakim’s argument that the landlord’s notice is
    defective is also weak.  Hakim relies on
    the rider to the offer to lease, which states that “notice to demolish and
    redevelop the premises from the <span class=SpellE>lessor</span> can only be
    given to the lessee during the last six months of the first seven (7) year
    term.”  Hakim argues that the court
    should not give effect to the landlord’s notice because that notice did not
    specify an intention to demolish.  However, as the landlord’s counsel points out, the operative notice
    provision is in the option to extend clause.  The landlord’s notice tracks the wording of that clause.  Moreover, Hakim’s position, is at best,
    highly technical because it has known for five months that the landlord intends
    to redevelop the property and not extend the lease.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the balance of convenience favours the
    landlord.  Although Hakim will no longer
    be able to stay in the <span class=GramE>premises, that</span> is because of
    the contract it struck with the landlord.  The landlord bargained for and obtained the right not to extend the
    lease if it planned, as it does now, to redevelop the property.  The landlord is simply exercising its
    contractual right.  Moreover, Hakim has
    known of the landlord’s intent for many months and thus has had ample time to
    find alternative premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The landlord does not yet have its permits to proceed
    with the redevelopment but that does not negate its urgent need for the leased
    premises.  The landlord proposes to build
    a 42 storey residential/commercial building.  As detailed in the affidavit of its principal Claude <span class=SpellE>Bitton</span>,
    the landlord has already spent a great deal of time and money on the planning
    process, which appears to be well underway.  It requires the leased premise as soon as possible to begin pre-sales of
    units in the building.  Because of these
    considerations the balance of convenience favours the landlord.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could, of course, grant a brief stay and expedite the
    appeal, relief that motion judges in this court often grant on stay
    motions.  However, I decline to do so in
    this case in view of the lack of any obvious merit in the appeal, and my
    assessment of the balance of convenience.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion for a stay or other relief is dismissed with
    costs in the amount of $4,000, inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
