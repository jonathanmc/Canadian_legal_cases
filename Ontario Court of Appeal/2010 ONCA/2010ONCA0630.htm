  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central ground of appeal raised is that the trial
    judge ought not to have accepted Dr. Benoit’s evidence in relation to S.S.’s
    ability to parent. It is argued that Dr.&nbsp;Benoit’s evidence in a subsequent
    trial involving S.S.’s other younger child contradicted the evidence she gave
    in the earlier trial, which is the subject of this appeal. This is, in part,
    the fresh evidence motion before us.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Benoit did a parental capacity assessment of S.S.
    in relation to her older child L.  She
    concluded for reasons set out in that report that S.S. did not have the
    capacity to parent L. although she was willing to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a subsequent trial in March 2010, Dr. Benoit also
    gave evidence.  She was very clear in her
    evidence that she did not re-interview S.S. nor did she ever interview the
    younger child. She was also clear that if all remained as it had been two and
    one-half years earlier, her opinion would remain the same.  If things had changed, she was unable to
    comment on any changes. Counsel suggests this statement contradicts her earlier
    evidence when she opined that the damage sustained by S.S. was irreversible.  We do not agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Dr. Benoit repeated on numerous occasions during her
    protracted cross-examination in March 2010, anything is possible.  Things can and do change and she was unaware
    of any changes that may have occurred in the two and one-half years since she
    had conducted her assessment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the argument in relation to Dr. Benoit’s
    expertise, counsel at both trials accepted Dr. Benoit’s expertise as did the
    trial judge. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Gratl</span> suggests now that Dr.&nbsp;Benoit
    was not qualified to give opinion evidence on the effect of <span class=SpellE>Cortisol</span> on the brain in children exposed to highly stressful situations. She has
    produced no expert evidence that takes issue with Dr. Benoit’s evidence about
    the recent studies involving children exposed to situations of high stress.  She cannot come to this court now and take
    issue with Dr. Benoit’s expertise to give this evidence without some expert
    evidence to back up her allegation, particularly, in a situation where Dr.
    Benoit’s expertise was acknowledged, accepted by all counsel present and no
    objection was taken to her evidence when it was given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted Dr. Benoit’s evidence as she
    was entitled to do and there is no basis for us to interfere.  It is insufficient to come to this court and
    simply attempt to file articles found on the internet which relate to the
    effect of <span class=SpellE>Cortisol</span> on the brain.  There is no opinion from anyone qualified to
    give one that these articles are authoritative.  Absent such evidence, they are of no evidentiary value and are inadmissible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the fresh evidence application is
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this appeal is an attempt to simply retry
    this case.  There is no doubt that this
    is a tragic case.  S.S. has lost her child
    L. who has been made a Crown ward with no access.  However, the trial judge carefully listened to
    the evidence over some 12 days.  Her
    careful reasons for judgment are thorough and complete and she accepted Dr.&nbsp;Benoit’s
    evidence as she was entitled to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sadly, for S.S. she concluded that it was in the best
    interests of L. that she be made a Crown ward with no access.  L. is in a potential adoptive home with her
    younger sibling. She is four years old and she is entitled to have some
    stability and finality in order to get on with her life.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge’s reasons are equally careful and
    considered and we can find no basis to interfere.  The appeal is dismissed.</p>
