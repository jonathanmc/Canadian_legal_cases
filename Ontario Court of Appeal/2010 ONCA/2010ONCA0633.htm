  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants, James Searle and his company Service
    Sheet Metal Inc. (the Searle respondents) move for security for the costs of an
    appeal brought by the plaintiffs (now appellants).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Searle respondents and the defendant William <span
class=SpellE>Flesch</span> and his company WJF Investments Inc. brought summary
    judgment motions to dismiss the appellants’ action against them.  Belobaba J. granted their motions.  The appellants have appealed his orders.  The Searle respondents seek an order that the
    appellants be required to post security for the costs awarded in their favour
    by Belobaba J. on the summary judgment motion, $20,000, together with $6,420
    for the costs of the appeal.  </p>

    will briefly set out the background that gives rise to this motion.  In 2003, Searle and <span class=SpellE>Flesch</span> formed a partnership to sell and service heating, ventilation and air
    conditioning systems in the commercial and industrial market.  In 2006, they sold their interests to the
    appellants under an acquisition agreement.  The agreement contained restrictive covenants and an indemnification
    clause.  Under the indemnification
    clause, if <span class=SpellE>Flesch</span> and his company breach the
    restrictive covenants or otherwise wrong the appellants and are required to pay
    damages, the Searle respondents are required to pay one third of the damages
    awarded.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants brought this action claiming that both <span class=SpellE>Flesch</span> and Searle breached the restrictive covenants in the acquisition agreement and
    committed other wrongs.  However, on the
    summary judgment motions, the appellants acknowledged that they had no direct case
    against the Searle respondents.  The
    Searle respondents remained in the action only because of their potential
    liability under the indemnification clause.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the motion before me, counsel for the appellants reiterated that his clients
    have no claim against the Searle respondents apart from their obligation under
    the indemnification clause.  The
    appellants still seek to hold <span class=SpellE>Flesch</span> liable for
    damages and to obtain one third of those damages from the Searle respondents.</span></p>

    rule 61.06 of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, a judge of this court has jurisdiction to order security for the

    cases:</span></p>

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span

    it appears that an order for security for costs could be made against the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where
    it appears that for other good reasons security for costs should be ordered.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Searle respondents cannot rely on either of the first two categories.  Although they question the strength of the
    appeal, the Searle respondents do not assert that it appears frivolous.  Moreover, they acknowledge that the
    appellants are not impecunious.  They
    also acknowledge that they are not entitled to an order for security for costs
    under rule 56.01.  They rest their motion
    on the residual third category, “for other good reason”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
    constitutes “other good reason”?  The
    court does not have a closed list of cases in which security for costs has been
    ordered under the residual category.  The
    list of reasons justifying security under the residual category is open
    ended.  However, the “other good reason”
    must be related to the purpose for ordering security: that a respondent is
    entitled to a measure of protection for costs incurred and to be incurred in
    the proceeding, which is now on appeal.  And, the “other good reason” should be a fairly compelling reason, as
    the respondent cannot meet the requirements of either of the first two
    categories.  Security for costs awards
    under the residual category are not to be made routinely.  I now turn to the Searle respondents’
    specific requests. </span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(a)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       Security for costs of
    the appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Searle respondents’ request for security for the costs of the appeal has no
    merit.  Searle and his company are
    properly respondents on the appeal because of their potential liability under the
    indemnification clause.  They intend to
    participate in the appeal, as might be expected, by supporting the position of <span
class=SpellE>Flesch</span>.  There is no
    “good reason” to order the appellants to post security for the costs of the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       <span class=GramE>Security
    for the costs of the motion before Belobaba J.</span></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Searle respondents’ request that the appellants post security for the $20,000 in
    costs ordered by Belobaba J. is not as straightforward.  The appellants made two separate claims
    against the Searle respondents: a claim for damages for breach of the
    restrictive covenants and for other wrongdoing; and, a claim for
    indemnification should <span class=SpellE>Flesch</span> <span class=GramE>be</span> found liable for damages.  In their
    appeal, the appellants maintain the latter claim, but not the former.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Searle respondents say that most, if not all, of the $20,000 costs award
    pertains to the appellants’ claim for breach of the restrictive covenants and
    other wrongdoing, which the appellants have now abandoned.  Therefore, the Searle respondents argue that
    it would be just to order the appellants to post that amount as security.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    argument has some attractiveness, but I reject it.  First, as I have said, the Searle respondents
    are properly parties to the appeal both from their perspective and the
    perspective of the appellants because of their potential liability under the
    indemnification clause.  Thus, at bottom,
    the Searle respondents seek to have the appellants make an advance payment into
    court in the amount of the motion judge’s costs award before the appeal is heard,
    even though the notice of appeal automatically stays payment of that costs
    award.  I see no compelling reason for
    requiring the appellants to do so.  If
    the costs award stands after the appeal is decided, there is no suggestion that
    at that time the Searle respondents will be unable to collect those costs from
    the appellants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the $20,000 costs award is not wholly attributable to the abandoned claim
    against the Searle respondents.  The
    motion judge commented in his endorsement on costs (at para. 12) that the
    Searle respondents’ position on the summary judgment motion was to “follow on”
    and support the <span class=SpellE>Flesch</span> defendants.  From his comments, I take it that the costs
    award in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the Searle respondents reflects
    both time taken to defend the allegations against them and time taken to
    support <span class=SpellE>Flesch</span>.  Yet there is no breakdown between the two.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    if the appellants succeed on their appeal, they may be entitled to have the
    $20,000 costs award reduced and even offset by a costs award in their <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> from this court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the Searle respondents’ motion for security for
    costs.  The appellants are entitled to
    their costs of this motion in the amount of $3,500, inclusive of disbursements
    and applicable taxes.</span></p>
