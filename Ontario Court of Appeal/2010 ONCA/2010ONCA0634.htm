  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Feldman J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Best Day Tours is a bus transportation company that operates
    exclusively in Mexico. <a name="OLE_LINK2">It had a contract with Sunwing, a
    company headquartered in Toronto, to </a><a name="OLE_LINK1">provide transport between a Cancun resort and
    the Cancun airport for Sunwing tour guests</a>. The plaintiffs in the
    two actions were on a Sunwing tour package from Ontario. On the way from the
    resort to the airport for the flight home, the bus was in a one-vehicle
    accident. The travelling plaintiffs suffered serious injuries. The accident was
    investigated by local police in Mexico, who reported that it was caused solely
    by the negligence of the bus-driver.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs brought an action in Ontario for damages
    against Sunwing and Best Day. Sunwing cross-claimed against Best Day for
    contribution and indemnity, based primarily on the indemnification agreement they
    signed following the accident to deal with claims arising out of the accident.  Best Day challenged both the jurisdiction of the
    Ontario court and the convenience of the Ontario forum. The motion judge
    dismissed both aspects of the motion, applying the test from the “<i>Muscutt </i>quintet”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>.
    Following the decision on the motion, this court released its decision in <i>Van Breda v. Village Resorts Limited </i>(2010),
    98 O.R. (3d) 721 (C.A.), which reconsidered and revised the <i>Muscutt </i>test. This appeal was argued
    based on the law as now set out in <i>Van
    Breda</i>. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The travelling plaintiffs, who all resided in Ontario,
    purchased vacation packages from Sunwing in Ontario for weeklong vacations at a
    resort in Cancun, Mexico for the week of January 7 – 14, 2005 . The packages
    included ground transportation from the airport to the resort and back. On
    January 14, 2005, while transporting the plaintiffs from the resort to the
    airport, the bus was in a single-vehicle collision, which the Mexican police
    concluded was caused by the driver’s unsafe speed. Three of the plaintiffs were
    injured, were treated in hospital in Mexico and in Ontario, and suffered
    significant damages as claimed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the accident, Sunwing had a “Ground
    Transportation Agreement” for the bus transportation with Best Day. The
    agreement contained a choice of Ontario law clause. Best Day subcontracted the
    bus service to another Mexico corporation, Autobus Rapidos de Zacatlan S.A. de
    C.V., known as AutoTur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three days after the accident, Best Day and Sunwing
    entered into an agreement with AutoTur wherein,<i> inter alia</i>, AutoTur<i> </i>released
    both Best Day and Sunwing for claims under “<i>The
    Negligence Act of Ontario</i>”, and Best Day acknowledged that it would retain
    and pay the Toronto law firm Berkow, Cohen LLP to defend Best Day and Sunwing
    against any claims stemming from the accident. This agreement stated further
    that “[t]he parties agree that this Agreement shall be interpreted in the
    Courts with the law of the Province of Ontario and that the Courts of the
    Province of Ontario shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising
    from this agreement.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 28, 2005, Best Day entered into an indemnity
    agreement with Sunwing, wherein it agreed, <i>inter
    alia</i>, to indemnify Sunwing for any claims arising out of the accident, to
    retain the law firm of Berkow Cohen LLP in Toronto to represent both Best Day
    and Sunwing in respect of any claims arising out of the accident, that the
    Ontario courts would have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out
    of the indemnity agreement, and that the law of Ontario would apply to the
    interpretation of the indemnity agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both sets of plaintiffs commenced their actions in
    Ontario on January 12, 2007.  Sunwing
    defended the actions and cross-claimed against Best Day. Best Day did not
    defend but brought its motion to dismiss or stay the actions returnable
    December 19, 2008.</p>
  <h3>The Motion Judge’s Reasons</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge used the <i>Muscutt</i> analysis to address first the issue of jurisdiction, then
    the issue of forum. Applying the eight factors to determine jurisdiction, she
    concluded that there is a real and substantial connection between Ontario and
    the plaintiffs’ claims. First, she found a strong connection between the plaintiffs’
    claims and Ontario because of the connections of the plaintiffs and their
    witnesses to Ontario, the Ground Transportation Agreement between Best Day and
    Sunwing that was governed by Ontario law, as well as the presumed expectation of
    Best Day from transporting Ontario visitors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although there would be some unfairness to Best Day to have
    to litigate in Ontario, that unfairness was mitigated by the indemnity
    agreements with Sunwing as well as with AutoTur, which the motion judge found
    was likely to have insurance. On the other hand, there would be significant
    unfairness to the plaintiffs if the claims had to be brought in Mexico,
    including the juridical impediment of a limitation period that had already
    passed. Also, because the main issue would be damages, there would be
    unfairness because most of the witnesses are in Ontario. Regarding other
    involved parties, Sunwing preferred to litigate in Ontario and to enforce its
    indemnity agreement according to its terms. The motion judge found that Ontario
    has recognized judgments from other jurisdictions in similar circumstances. Only
    the last two factors militated against finding a real and substantial
    connection: that assuming jurisdiction in Ontario was more difficult to justify
    because this is an international case, and enforcement in Mexico would be
    difficult. Considering all the factors together, the motion judge concluded
    that there was a real and substantial connection that warranted the assumption
    of jurisdiction by the Ontario court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the question of forum <i>conveniens,</i> the motion judge recognized several factors that were
    either neutral or tilted in favour of Mexico as the convenient forum. These
    factors included that the law of Mexico applies to the plaintiffs’ tort claim
    against Best Day; that there may be difficulties enforcing an Ontario judgment
    in Mexico; and that witnesses in both jurisdictions could testify by video
    conference. However, she concluded that all the factors she considered on the
    jurisdiction question supported her conclusion that Ontario was the convenient
    forum for hearing the actions, and on that basis, she declined to order a stay.</p>
  <h3>Issues on Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the new test from <i>Van Breda</i>, did the motion judge err in concluding that Ontario
    should assume jurisdiction over the claim? If not, did the motion judge err in
    concluding that Ontario was the convenient forum?</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>Analysis</h3>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid;
'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Jurisdiction <i>Simpliciter</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the revised <i>Van
    Breda</i> analysis, the first issue is whether there is presumed jurisdiction
    because of the application of rule 17.02 (other than ss. (h) and (o)) of the Rules
    of Civil Procedure, which governs service out of the jurisdiction. With respect
    to the defendant Best Day, no subsection of the Rule applies other than ss. (h)
    and (o).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Therefore, the focus of the jurisdiction analysis shifts to the key connecting factor
    identified in <i>Van Breda</i>, which is the
    connection of the claims and of the defendants to Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As these appeals involve international travel on a tour
    package by Ontario residents, they are very factually reminiscent of two of the
    cases that were decided with <i>Muscutt</i>,<i> Leufkens v. Alba Tours</i> and <i>Lemmex v. Bernard</i>.  Because this court concluded in both those cases
    that Ontario should not assume jurisdiction, it is important to identify any
    relevant factors in these appeals that would distinguish them from <i>Leufkens </i>and <i>Lemmex </i>and then analyze whether those factors are sufficient to
    cause the court to conclude that Ontario ought to assume jurisdiction.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Leufkens</i>,
    the Ontario plaintiffs purchased a vacation package to Costa Rica from Alba
    Tours, an Ontario company, which then contracted with a Costa Rican company,
    Swiss Travel, to provide the tour services locally. One of the plaintiffs was
    injured on the treetop rope excursion that they purchased from Swiss Travel
    while in Costa Rica.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court concluded at paragraph 26 that the Ontario
    court lacked jurisdiction, largely because there was an insufficient connection
    between the jurisdiction and the defendant:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a company offering services specifically
    designed for tourists, Swiss Travel Service could certainly foresee the risk
    that negligence on its part could lead to injury to foreign tourists who would
    return home and suffer consequential damages.  Moreover, given its contractual relationship with Canadian tour
    companies, Swiss Travel Service could foresee that residents of Ontario could
    be the foreign tourists in question.  However, for the reasons given in <i>Muscutt</i>,
    I agree with the finding of the motions court judge that the foreseeability of
    a claim being made in an injured tourist’s jurisdiction does not bring the case
    within the principle articulated in <i>Moran
    v. Pyle National (Canada) Ltd.</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 393.  As the motions court judge explained, “<span
class=GramE>the</span> proper question is not whether it was reasonably
    foreseeable to the Costa Rican defendants that they would be sued in Ontario”
    but rather “whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the services provided
    would cause an injury in Ontario”.  Accordingly, I conclude that there is no significant connection between
    the defendant and the forum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Lemmex</i>,
    the Ontario plaintiffs purchased a cruise package from Sunflight, which
    contracted with Premier, an American company, to provide the cruise. On board
    ship, the passengers were offered various shore excursions. The plaintiffs
    chose a trip to Grenada, which was provided by the Grenadian company Huggins
    Ltd. While on the excursion, because the local taxi that provided ground transportation
    was defective, one of the plaintiffs suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. The
    plaintiffs included the local taxi driver and Huggins Ltd. as defendants in
    their suit in Ontario against Sunflight and Premier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again this court found that the connection between the
    claim and the defendants with Ontario was not sufficiently real and substantial
    for Ontario to assume jurisdiction. The defendants carried on business only in
    Grenada, and while Huggins Ltd. targeted foreign tourists, the court concluded
    that it would be unfair for a tourist’s home forum to assume jurisdiction based
    only on the foreseeability that the tourist might possibly be injured in the
    taxi. At paragraph 38, the court adopted the following rhetorical question
    posed by the Divisional Court judge when granting leave to appeal to that
    court:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lemmex, his wife and his daughter chose to leave
    Ontario and travel to Grenada for a vacation. They chose to take a tour on Grenada
    offered by a Grenadian company. They were aware that injuries could be
    sustained in Grenada, just like they could be anywhere else one goes. Was it
    reasonable for them to expect that if one of them was injured through the
    negligence of a Grenadian, an action would be heard in Ontario, the law of
    Grenada would have to be proven in the Ontario court, and Grenadian witnesses
    might have to travel to Ontario to give their evidence?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Do Ontario courts foster order and fairness by
    assuming jurisdiction in the first action where Huggins and Bernard are
    defendants? Is it fair to expect Bernard, a local taxi driver in Grenada, to
    come to Ontario to defend this action?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To repeat, as the connection of both the claim and the
    defendant to the Ontario forum is the key factor in the jurisdiction analysis,
    it is important to address what, if any, are the factual distinctions between this
    case and the <i>Leufkens</i> and <i>Lemmex </i>cases, where the lack of
    sufficient connection caused jurisdiction to be denied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are three key differences. First, the vacation
    packages—which explicitly included ground transportation services—were
    purchased in Ontario.  Second, Best Day’s
    Ground Transportation Agreement with Sunwing was agreed to be governed by
    Ontario law. This can be contrasted with the situation in <i>Leufkens</i>, where the agreement between the Ontario tour operator and
    the Costa Rican Swiss Travel <span class=GramE>company</span> was made in Costa
    Rica and had no Ontario aspect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, and most significantly, Best Day entered into indemnity
    agreements with Sunwing and AutoTur following the accident. Both agreements
    were made in respect of any lawsuit that might be brought in Ontario by one of
    the tourists who was injured in the bus accident, the very type of lawsuit that
    was brought by the plaintiffs in these two cases. In the agreement with Sunwing,
    Best Day agreed that if Sunwing were to be sued as a result of the accident,
    that Best Day would indemnify Sunwing and save it harmless including in respect
    of costs claimed and its own solicitor’s costs. Best Day also agreed that in
    interpreting the indemnity agreement, Ontario courts would have exclusive
    jurisdiction and that Ontario law would apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these factors are significant and
    distinguish the <i>Leufkens</i> and <i>Lemmex </i>cases from these appeals in
    respect of the connection between the defendant and Ontario. By voluntarily entering
    into the two indemnity agreements with Sunwing and with AutoTur, Best Day has
    effectively acknowledged the expectation that claims arising out of the
    accident would or could be brought in Ontario, certainly against Sunwing, and
    that those claims would have to be litigated in Ontario. Even if an Ontario
    action did not name Best Day, Best Day would be brought into it as a third
    party by Sunwing for indemnity under its indemnity agreement, and as agreed,
    Ontario would have the exclusive jurisdiction to determine any indemnity issues
    applying Ontario law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, in respect of claims such as those brought
    by the plaintiffs in these two actions, Best Day expected and contemplated that
    they would be litigated in Ontario, and in respect of an essential party to the
    actions, Sunwing, Best Day has agreed to litigate in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the effect of these factors, taken
    together, is to establish the necessary real and substantial connection between
    the plaintiffs’ claims, the defendant Best Day, and the Ontario forum. It also
    overcomes the factors that would otherwise speak against a connection between
    Ontario and Best Day, despite circumstances that are otherwise factually
    similar to those in the <i>Leufkens</i> and <i>Lemmex</i> cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Van Breda</i> instructs that other considerations in the jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i> analysis are no longer to be treated as independent
    factors, but rather as principles that bear upon the analysis, including the fairness
    to each party of assuming or refusing to assume jurisdiction, the involvement
    of other parties in the action, the willingness to recognize and enforce an
    extra-provincial judgment with similar jurisdictional connections to the forum,
    comity, and the standards of enforcement in the other jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, any unfairness to Best Day in Ontario
    assuming jurisdiction is overridden by the terms of the indemnity agreement
    already discussed. The motion judge found that Ontario has enforced judgments
    where jurisdiction was assumed by the foreign court in similar circumstances.
    Although the record suggests that there may be problems enforcing a judgment in
    Mexico, the plaintiffs have elected to proceed in the face of any such
    potential difficulties. In any event, if liability is established at trial on a
    joint and several <span class=GramE>basis</span>, as is pleaded in the
    statements of claim, the plaintiffs will be able to enforce their judgments
    against Sunwing in Ontario.<a href="#_ftn3"

'>[3]</span></span></span></a> As discussed above, the involvement of Sunwing as a necessary party in the
    Ontario actions is a critical connecting factor, because of the indemnity
    agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, weighing all of the independent factors and
    other relevant considerations, the motion judge did not err in her conclusion
    that the balance favours Ontario assuming jurisdiction in these actions.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Forum <i>Conveniens</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Unlike the issue
    of jurisdiction, which is a question of law although it involves the weighing
    of factors and the application of overarching principles, the decision on
    whether there is a more convenient and appropriate forum is an exercise of
    judicial discretion and is subject to deference on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge recognized factors that made both
    Ontario and Mexico potentially available fora in these cases. However, she
    declined to exercise her discretion to move the actions from Ontario. She
    referred to factors she had considered in her jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i> analysis. One of these factors was the location and
    convenience of many medical witnesses in Ontario. As Sharpe J.A. reiterated in <i>Van Breda</i>, this factor is relevant only
    to the forum <i>conveniens</i> analysis and
    is not to be considered when deciding whether there is jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies on the fact that all the liability
    witnesses are in Mexico. However, as the motion judge pointed out, the major
    issue in these cases will be the extent and quantification of damages. She also
    noted that, if necessary, witnesses could appear via video conference. Having
    said that, the plaintiff May saw 12 medical practitioners in Ontario, while the
    plaintiff Dilkas saw 39 medical service providers here. The key loss of income
    and collateral benefits witnesses are here as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two other significant factors that are very relevant to
    the forum<i> conveniens</i> issue are the
    juridical disadvantage that the plaintiffs may suffer in Mexico because of the
    passage of the limitation period in that jurisdiction, and the issue of
    multiplicity of actions, as the actions against Sunwing will proceed in
    Ontario. Finally, the motion judge noted that the plaintiffs and Sunwing were
    willing to take on the burden of enforcing any judgment in Mexico.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no error in the conclusion reached by the motion

    and find no basis to interfere with her determination.</a></p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeals are dismissed with costs to the respondents

'>[2]</span></span></span></a> When serving Best Day in Mexico, the plaintiffs relied on rules 17.02(h), (o)
    and (f) (contracts made in Ontario). The reference to rule 17.02(f) was,
    presumably, based on a theory of the case where Best Day was a foreign agent of
    Sunwing, and the contract between the plaintiffs and Sunwing was entered into
    in Ontario. However, this would not trigger a jurisdictional presumption.  In <i>Van
    Breda</i>, Sharpe J.A. held that the jurisdictional presumption under rule
    17.02(f) did not arise regarding the foreign agent of the Ontario defendants,
    even though the foreign agent was involved in the promotion and execution of
    the Ontario contract: <i>Van Breda v.
    Village Resorts Limited </i>(2010), 98 O.R. (3d) 721 at para. <span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a> The appellant submits that, based on the case of <i>Craven v. Strand Holidays (Canada) Ltd</i>., [1982] O.J. No. 3599
    (C.A.), Best Day cannot be found jointly and severally liable with Sunwing. In
    that case the court found that there was no implied agreement by the tour
    operator with the tourists for safe transportation and therefore there could be
    no liability on the tour operator for negligence by a tour bus driver as their
    relationship was one of independent contractor. In these actions, the issue of
    the relationships among the parties and the basis for liability is pleaded and
    will depend in part on findings of fact and on the interpretation of any
    relevant agreements, and is an issue that is open for determination in the
    actions.  Moreover, even if the
    plaintiffs are ultimately unsuccessful against Sunwing, Best Day has a real and
    substantial connection to Ontario, in large part because it chose to sign the
    Indemnification Agreement.</p>
