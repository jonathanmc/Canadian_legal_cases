    the judge or justice is of the opinion that such an order is in the interest of
    public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper administration of justice
    or is necessary to prevent injury to international relations or national
    defence or national security.</p>

  <p class=Paragraph1><strong>(3)</strong>            If an accused is charged with an
    offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or
    (3) or section 163.1, 171, 172, 172.1, 173, 212, 271, 272 or 273 and the

    product misappropriated in their business ventures in drugs, prostitution and
    money-lending.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duong decided that he wanted Ton dead. Killed, along
    with Ton’s wife, Bon Bui, if they were together.  Arrangements were necessary. Money to finance
    the job.  A killer or two to carry it
    out.  A weapon.  A place away from public view.  An escape plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duong asked for financial help from his lover, Minh
    Dang, a prostitute associated with both Ton and Duong.  She agreed.  Duong enlisted Ibrahim <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>, an associate in
    the drug business, to find a killer or two to do the job.  <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> agreed. He
    proposed <span class=SpellE>Vinicio</span> Cardoso and Bruce Glen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A murder weapon was essential.  Duong arranged for a handgun to be brought to
    Buffalo from California.  Three men, including
    Long <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span>, came with it. <span class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> sometime common law partner, Genevieve Ward, drove to Buffalo and returned to
    Canada with the handgun.  The men who brought
    the handgun to Buffalo entered Canada separately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> entreated Dang to
    persuade Duong to have Cardoso and Glen kill Ton and Bui, rather than to have any
    of the men from the United States do so.  Duong agreed.  A place for the
    killing was selected, a plan developed to lure the victims there to be killed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a pretence of going elsewhere, Dang lured Ton and
    Bui to a dark, deserted <span class=SpellE>cul&#8209;de</span>-sac near Highway
    11, north of Barrie.  There, Cardoso and
    Glen, armed and out of view, waited. Several shots were fired. Beatings
    followed. Dang left to meet Duong nearby.  Ton and Bui died there.  Everybody
    else fled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In time, arrests were made.  Dang.  Duong. Cardoso.  Glen.  <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>.  And Ward.  Later, Dang made a deal with the prosecutor and testified against the
    others at their joint trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a trial lasting nine months, a jury convicted <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>, Duong and Cardoso of two counts of first degree
    murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder.  Glen and Ward were acquitted of each of the
    charges on which they were tried.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>, Cardoso and Duong
    appeal their convictions. They allege that the jury selection at their trial
    was flawed because the prosecutor had information about prospective jurors that
    was not disclosed to their trial counsel.  They also claim that the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury
    were riddled with error.  In the result,
    they say, they should have another trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. The appellants’ <span class=GramE>counsel
    at trial were</span> aware that inquiries had been made to determine whether
    prospective jurors had criminal records, but did nothing about it.  The undisclosed details did not affect the
    reliability of the verdicts rendered nor compromise the actual or apparent fairness
    of the trial.  The final instructions, while
    not a model of brevity and clarity, were nonetheless adequate in the
    circumstances of this overwhelming prosecution case.  I would dismiss the appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When first argued, the grounds of appeal advanced all
    related to the adequacy of the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury. We
    reserved judgment. During the time judgment was under reserve, the parties
    became aware of a “jury vetting” practice that had prevailed for a number of
    years in the trial venue.  Inquiries were
    made.  Transcripts of the jury selection
    process were prepared.  A record was
    compiled, including affidavits on which cross-examinations were conducted.  The appeal was re-opened and argument heard
    about the effect of what had occurred on the integrity of the trial process and
    the reliability of the verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These reasons deal first with what was argued last, the
    jury selection issue, <span class=GramE>then</span> examine the adequacy of the
    trial judge’s final instructions.</p>

    December 13, 2004, someone from the Court Services Branch provided a copy of
    the jury panel lists to the Crown Attorney’s office.  Section 20 of the <i>Juries Act</i> forbids disclosure of these lists “until 10 days before
    the sittings of the court for which the panel has been drafted”. The return
    date of the first panel was January 24, 2005.</span></p>
  <h3>The
    Memorandum of the Crown Attorney</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 14, 2004, an administrative assistant in
    the Crown Attorney’s office sent the jury panel lists to every police force
    with jurisdiction in Simcoe County. A form memorandum explained what was
    sought:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Please check the attached jury panel list, for the
    persons listed in your locality, and advise if any of them have criminal
    records.  We are not able to provide
    birth dates.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would also be helpful if comments could be made
    concerning any disreputable persons we would not want as a juror.  All we can ask is that you do your best
    considering the lack of information available to us.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Please relay the information by telephone to (705)
    739-6188 on or before Wednesday, January 12, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any information provided by a police force in response
    to the memorandum was transposed to a copy of the jury panel list in the Crown
    Attorney’s office.</p>
  <h3>The
    Background Checks</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without objection, the respondent filed affidavits from
    three individuals to explain the checks that were made.  Each affiant was cross-examined.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det. Sgt. Donald Anthony was the lead investigator.
    Prov. <span class=SpellE>Cst</span>. Hugh <span class=SpellE>McConachie</span>,
    who is now retired, was the Court Case Manager for the Barrie Detachment of the
    Ontario Provincial Police.  Both
    explained the inquiries they made in connection with prospective jurors as a
    result of the Crown Attorney’s memorandum.  Robert Murray, a civilian member of the RCMP, is the person in charge of
    Civil Pardons and Purge Services of the Canadian Criminal Real Time
    Identification Services (CCRTIS).  He
    explained the data available to approved agencies in the Identification Data
    Bank and the extent of information required to determine whether a particular
    individual has a criminal record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det. Sgt. Anthony ran record checks on 46 prospective
    jurors.  His checks extended beyond the
    CPIC data base to include internal police records systems.  He made notes about his findings: “Okay”,
    “0”, “10-60”, “possible record” and similar cryptic comments.  Det. Sgt. Anthony recorded his comments in
    his notes, and provided them to the Crown Attorney’s office. The officer was in
    court during jury selection and offered his view to the prosecutor, based on
    his annotated jury panel list, before the prosecutor was required to say
    “challenge” or “content”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det. Sgt. Anthony explained that he confined his checks,
    as did former Prov. <span class=SpellE>Cst</span>. <span class=SpellE>McConachie</span>,
    to the area of Simcoe County in which his detachment had jurisdiction.  He explained that because jury panel lists do
    not include dates of birth of prospective jurors, he would access other records
    systems, to ascertain whether the person had had any contact with police. The
    officer said that his purpose in performing these searches was to find persons
    who were likely to be neutral if selected because they had not been “in trouble
    with the law”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>McConachie</span> identified
    prospective jurors who lived in the Oro-<span class=SpellE>Medonte</span> area
    policed by the Barrie Detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police.  Sometimes, he was asked to conduct record
    checks for persons living elsewhere in Simcoe County.  <span class=SpellE>McConachie’s</span> checks
    did <i>not</i> extend beyond the CPIC data
    base.  He would input the prospective juror’s
    name and follow up a positive response with a record check.  When the record appeared, <span class=SpellE>McConachie</span> tried to determine from the place of conviction the likelihood of a match.  If he considered a match was possible, <span
class=SpellE>McConachie</span> noted the Finger Print Search (FPS) number and
    record.  He added the birth date.  His only purpose was to find out whether
    someone had a criminal record and to forward that information to the Crown
    Attorney’s office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>McConachie</span> was adamant that
    he checked no data base beyond CPIC.  He
    did not have the time, nor was it his job to go beyond criminal records.  He did not consider it his decision <span
class=GramE>who</span> would be selected as a juror.  <span class=SpellE>McConachie</span> performed record checks on over 300 prospective jurors. He did not make any
    notes indicating “okay”, but confined his notations to criminal records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert Murray described the several data banks
    maintained by the RCMP on the basis of information supplied by law enforcement
    agencies.  He explained that the data
    bases included a Criminal Name Index (CNI), Criminal Record Synopsis (CRS), and
    criminal records. To be entered in the system, any information submitted by a law
    enforcement agency must be supported by fingerprints and comply with any
    applicable statutory requirements, but need <i>not </i>indicate whether the mode of procedure was by indictment or by summary
    conviction. Verification of a criminal record cannot be made without <i>both</i> a date of birth and a set of
    fingerprints.  Every type of inquiry
    requires identifiers beyond a person’s name.  Occurrence reports are <i>not</i> included in these data bases.<i></i></p>
  <h3>Disclosure
    of Record Checks Prior to Jury Selection</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before jury selection began, the prosecutor did <i>not</i> disclose to defence counsel the fact
    that police forces in Simcoe County were conducting record checks on prospective
    jurors, the nature of the checks conducted, or the information obtained from those
    checks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants have filed no affidavit material from
    any of the five experienced counsel who represented the appellants and the co-accused,
    Glen and Ward, at trial. The record rests silent, to say the same thing
    differently, about any knowledge they may have had about the practice of
    “jury-vetting” in Barrie or elsewhere, or any pre-trial inquiries they may have
    made on the subject. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The notes of Det. Sgt. Anthony, at least the portion of
    them dealing with the record checks, were <i>not</i> disclosed in advance of jury selection. <span class=SpellE>McConachie</span> did not maintain a notebook <span class=GramE>nor</span> other record of his
    work, apart from any endorsements he may have made on the lists or Memorandum
    he returned to the Crown Attorney’s office.</p>
  <h3>The Timing
    of Jury Selection</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each jury panel was scheduled to attend the court house
    on a specified date.  Typically, not
    everyone who was summoned appeared.  Those who did attend were divided into sub-groups of 25 and directed to
    return at a specific time and date to begin or continue the formal selection
    process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge directed the first sub-group to
    re-attend at 9:30 a.m. on February 28, 2005.  In the result, after excusals, deferrals, and failures to appear, the eight
    panels originally summoned were reduced to a total of 334 prospective jurors
    assigned to 14 time slots for re-attendance.</p>
  
  
  
  <h3>The Selection
    Procedure</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge permitted each prospective juror whose
    name was called to explain any problems that he or she might encounter if
    selected as a juror. Health concerns.  Employment difficulties.  Financial hardship.  Family problems.  Those who were not excused or deferred moved
    on to the next phase of the process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Duong, a member of a visible minority,
    challenged each prospective juror for cause on the ground of racial bias. Those
    prospective jurors who were unsuccessfully challenged for cause proceeded to
    the next phase of jury selection – the peremptory challenge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each juror who was successfully challenged for cause or
    was challenged per-<span class=SpellE>emptorily</span> received some
    instructions from the trial judge about communications with other panel
    members.  The rejected jurors were told
    not to remain around the courthouse, rather to leave immediately, and not to communicate
    with any remaining panel member about the selection process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During jury selection, Det. Sgt. Anthony was in the
    courtroom to assist the prosecutors.  It
    is a reasonable inference from the fresh evidence that the prosecutors had
    their jury lists with them in court during the selection procedure, in all
    likelihood, the tiered lists.  Some
    annotations on the tiered lists were obviously made in the courtroom during
    jury selection. After all, it would have been pointless for the prosecutors to
    have sought and obtained the results of police checks, yet leave them behind
    when the purpose for which they were created was unfolding.</p>
  <h3>The Juror
    Incidents</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 24, 2005, during the <span class=SpellE>tiering</span> process, the prosecutor queried the eligibility of a member of the jury panel.
    He thought that this prospective juror may have been convicted of an indictable
    offence and sought confirmation of the accuracy of his memory. The prosecutor
    complained about the jury lists: “you don’t get date of births [<i>sic</i>] anymore”.  He added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. FLOSMAN: [Crown counsel] Your Honour, I – when
    this gentleman was initially named back a few weeks ago the name rang a bell
    and I didn’t think about it more – <i>I
    found out that he had a criminal record</i> but I haven’t looked at it.  <i>I
    looked at it today</i> and I’m looking at a – I believe I was the prosecutor
    against his father, so ….  (Emphasis
    added.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the juror referred to in the preceding
    paragraph, it appears that 24 prospective jurors about whom the prosecutor had
    information from police checks appeared at the peremptory challenge stage of
    the jury selection process.  Detective
    Sgt. Anthony had provided information on 21 of those checks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second incident occurred on February 28, 2005, the
    first day on which the tiers appeared to begin the challenge of individual jurors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>JUROR NUMBER 1402:     Okay.  I was told that this would be the last
    opportunity possibly because I’ve been charged with things before, and I was
    wondering if that means that I’m exempt from this.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  Well, it depends.  <span
class=GramE>If it’s an indictable offence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>JUROR NUMBER 1402:     See
    that, I don’t know.  I could tell you
    what I was charged with.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  Well, I don’t know that that’s necessary but I suppose there would be
    ways of finding out.  And <i>I assume that for these purposes that would
    have been done</i>.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>JUROR NUMBER 1402:  <i>That’s what I would have assumed,
    as well</i>, yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  Right, so I’m going to continue, all right? Thank you for bringing that
    to our attention.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>JUROR NUMBER 1402:   No problem.   (Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties completed the jury selection on March 4,
    2005. No party exhausted their peremptory challenges. Defence counsel retained
    a total of 9 challenges, the prosecutor, <span class=GramE>73</span>. The
    obvious reference to a criminal record check in connection with one prospective
    juror, and the assumptions voiced by the trial judge and another prospective juror,
    compel two conclusions: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          that
    defence counsel were aware, during and before the conclusion       of the jury selection procedure, that the
    prosecutor had conducted   criminal
    records checks on prospective jurors; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         <span class=GramE>that</span> neither
    the fact that record checks had been done nor their results undisclosed raised any disclosure or trial fairness concerns
        among defence counsel.</p>
  <h3>The
    Disclosure of Det. Sgt. Anthony’s Notes</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 22, 2005, about seven weeks after jury
    selection had been completed, the prosecutor disclosed to defence counsel
    copies of Det. Sgt. Anthony’s notebook.  Included in the notes were unmistakeable references to CPIC checks:
    “list of potential jurors – need Barrie City people CPIC”, “drop off jury
    selection list to Hugh <span class=SpellE>McConachie</span>, CCM to do Barrie
    CPIC over holidays”; “CPIC list jurors” and “RMS/CPIC re jury panel list”.  Some entries were followed by a list of names
    included on the jury panel list and the results of the inquiries. The dates
    recounted in the notes demonstrate that the record checks of prospective jurors
    occurred before the formal selection of the jury began.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About four months after disclosure of copies of Det. Sgt.
    Anthony’s notes that revealed record checks of prospective jurors, trial
    counsel for the appellant Duong attempted to cross-examine Det. Sgt. Anthony on
    the failure of investigators to follow up on the potential involvement of a
    third party suspect:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. FLOSMAN: [Crown Counsel]   Your Honour, before we have the jury back
    in, I have a concern.  I think my friend
    is going down the road I presume he’s going in, this entry in Detective
    Anthony’s notes deals with him running CPIC checks on a jury list.  How is that relevant?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:   I do not know where he is going.  If that is the issue, how is that relevant?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. GRYS:  [Counsel
    for Duong] <span class=GramE>It</span> seems to me if they’ve got time to
    investigate a quantity of jurors, they’ve got time to investigate Daniel
    Nguyen.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. FLOSMAN:  With respect, it’s an attempt to embarrass the police officer in front
    of a jury, hey guess what, folks, I ran you.  I can indicate to the court the second jury trial I ever did, we found
    after we had a guy serving an intermittent sentence because they denied us the
    dates of birth for jurors.  So it’s a
    very laborious process, it’s done in each and every case and as you’ll notice
    what he says is he passes the list off to somebody else to look at, the court
    officer whose job it is.  In my
    respectful submission it’s not relevant, it shouldn’t be asked.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  I
    think that is beyond the realm of relevancy.  I am not going to permit that area of cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. GRYS:  That’s fine.  Thank you.  <span class=GramE>Your</span> Honour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  All right.  Yes, all right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disclosure of Det. Sgt. Anthony’s notes occurred eight
    months before the jury rendered its verdicts.  During this eight month period, none of the five experienced trial
    counsel for the appellants and co-accused sought further disclosure of the
    record checks conducted on prospective jurors, alleged an impairment of the
    right to make full answer and defence because of incomplete or untimely
    disclosure of the results of those checks, moved for a mistrial, or sought any
    other remedy.  Nothing.</p>
  
  
  
  <h3>The
    Appellate Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal first emerged in May 2009, after
    argument had been completed on the issues raised in the various notices of
    appeal.  It formed no part of the
    original argument.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the police investigation of
    the backgrounds of prospective jurors was unlawful from the outset.  The jury panel lists were delivered to the
    Crown Attorney’s office in breach of s. 20 of the <i>Juries Act</i> to allow sufficient time for the checks to be run. These
    were not simply checks for criminal records, but extended to any contact the
    prospective jurors may have had with law enforcement agencies. Their purpose
    was to ensure that the jurors chosen were favourably disposed towards the
    prosecution, not simply to weed out the ineligible or disqualified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants say that jury selection was not
    conducted on a level playing field.  The
    prosecutor had information about prospective jurors beyond what was available
    to defence counsel. This information was relevant to decisions about peremptory
    challenges, thus to the composition of the jury.  The information should have been disclosed to
    defence counsel so that all parties were equally equipped for jury
    selection.  The lack of timely disclosure
    effectively skewed the balance in favour of the prosecutor and created an
    appearance of unfairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants point to the significant disparity
    between the <span class=GramE>number</span> of challenges remaining to the
    prosecutor (73), when compared to the appellants (9), on completion of jury
    selection.  Such a disparity, the
    appellants say, suggests unfairness, the only cause of which was superior
    knowledge of the backgrounds of the prospective jurors. The appellants say they
    have established a reasonable apprehension of bias in the composition of the
    jury.  A new trial should follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the respondent, Ms. Fairburn acknowledges that any
    concrete information obtained on criminal record checks of prospective jurors
    should have been provided to trial counsel in advance of jury selection. The
    obligation to disclose was limited to positive information, not negative
    information, like the absence of a record. But trial counsel knew, as early as
    the pre-selection process and, at the latest with the disclosure of Det. Sgt.
    Anthony’s notes on April 22, 2005, that record checks had been done on
    prospective jurors.  The defence did
    nothing, for over four and one-half years.  They are disentitled to any relief now.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent further submits that, viewed as a case
    of failed or late disclosure, it falls to the appellants to demonstrate that
    there is a reasonable possibility that the omission or delay adversely impacted
    on the jury selection process or the overall fairness of the trial.  In this, Ms. Fairburn says, the appellants
    have failed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent asserts that when complaints of failed
    or late disclosure at trial are raised on appeal in support of a claim for a
    new trial, an appellant must first demonstrate a failure to meet the standard
    of disclosure required.  The failure of
    counsel to object is a significant factor in this analysis.  On satisfaction of this requirement, the
    appellants must further establish that the prosecutorial failure, whether by
    late delivery or non-delivery, infringed the appellants’ right to make full
    answer and defence and had an impact on the outcome or overall fairness of the
    trial proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Fairburn urges that any failure to adhere to the
    relevant disclosure standard had no adverse impact on the selection of the jury
    or the outcome of a trial. The disclosure defect had no impact on any
    prospective juror who was excused or deferred by the trial judge, on any
    prospective juror who was successfully challenged for cause, or on any
    prospective juror who was not reached in the selection process. At most, ten
    prospective jurors about whom the prosecutor had undisclosed information made
    it to the peremptory challenge phase of jury selection.  The prosecutor was required to state his
    position first in relation to five of these prospective jurors and the defence had
    to declare first for the other five.  No
    one exhausted their peremptory challenges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent takes the position that any complaint
    about the effect of failed or late disclosure on the fairness of the trial is
    belied by the failure of trial counsel to take any steps to obtain a remedy
    when <span class=GramE>apprised</span> of the conduct of which complaint is now
    made.</p>
  
  
  
  
  <h3>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several principles inform the decision on this ground
    of appeal.  Some have to do with the
    eligibility of persons to serve as jurors in a criminal case.  Others with the propriety of checking to
    determine whether prospective jurors are disqualified from service because of
    criminal convictions. Yet others define the disclosure obligations of the Crown
    and the remedies available on appeal for failed or late disclosure. </p>
  <h3><span>            </span>The Qualifications of Jurors</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An amalgam of federal and provincial legislation

    law is qualified to serve as a juror in a criminal case tried in that province.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 4(b) of the <i>Juries
    Act</i> declares <i>ineligible</i> for jury
    service anyone who has been convicted of an indictable offence and has not been
    granted a pardon for that conviction. The questionnaire sent to each person
    whose name has been randomly chosen for potential jury service asks each
    respondent a question about prior unpardoned convictions for indictable
    offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A person ineligible for jury service under s. 4(b) of
    the <i>Juries Act</i> would <i>not </i>be qualified as a juror according to
    provincial law, thus would <i>not</i> be
    qualified to serve as a juror in a criminal trial in this province because of
    s. 626(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The expression “indictable offence” in s. 4(b) of the <i>Juries Act</i> includes offences that are
    exclusively indictable, as well as those that are prosecuted by indictment
    where the prosecutor has the option to proceed by indictment or summary
    conviction: <i>R. v. Mitchell</i> (1998), 36
    O.R (3d) 643, (C.A.) at p. 646.  It is of
    no moment to s. 4(b) what punishment was imposed upon conviction.  </p>
  <h3>Challenges
    for Cause for Ineligibility</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 638(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> entitles the prosecutor or an accused to challenge
    prospective jurors for cause on the ground that the juror has been convicted of
    an offence for which he or she was sentenced to death or to imprisonment for a
    term of 12 months or more.  This
    provision, in its current or similar language, has been in force since the
    enactment of the <i>Criminal Code</i> of
    1892 when it was s. 668(4)(c).  The
    ground of challenge for which s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) provides is
    at once more and less <span class=SpellE>expansive</span> than the disqualifier
    under s. 4(b) of the <i>Juries Act</i>.  It is more expansive because s. 638(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c) would include summary conviction offences, provided the
    imprisonment threshold was satisfied.  But it is also less expansive because it would exclude indictable
    offences where the punishment did not meet or exceed the imprisonment
    threshold.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Challenges for cause involve an in-court procedure that
    takes place prior to any party being called upon to exercise a peremptory
    challenge.  Before a party is entitled to
    challenge for cause under s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b), the party must
    demonstrate a “realistic potential” that the jury pool may contain people who
    are not impartial: <i>R. v. Find</i>, [2001]
    1 S.C.R. 863, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 31; <i>R. v. Williams</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    14.  No principled reason justifies any diminution
    of the threshold approach when the challenge is advanced under s. 638(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A specific statutory procedure is not in place to
    permit a party to challenge a prospective juror for cause in a criminal case on
    the basis of ineligibility under provincial law. Section 32 of the <i>Juries Act</i> declares want of eligibility
    a good cause for challenge, but the provision does not apply to criminal
    proceedings. The release provisions of s. 24 and the excusal authority of s. 23
    of the <i>Juries Act</i> seem equally inapplicable.</p>
  <h3>The
    Propriety of Criminal Record Checks of Prospective Jurors</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since determinations of ineligibility under s. 4(6) of
    the <i>Juries Act</i> and disqualifications under
    s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>must be based on evidence, it seems reasonable to
    conclude that the parties are entitled to adduce evidence to support a claim of
    ineligibility under s. 4(b) or a challenge for cause based on a prior
    unpardoned conviction of crime under s. 638(1)(c).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 4.05(3) of the <i>Rules
    of Professional Conduct</i> <i>of the Law
    Society of Upper Canada</i> requires lawyers to disclose to the court “any
    information that the lawyer has about improper conduct by a member of a jury
    panel”. Rule 21 of the <i>Code of
    Professional Conduct of the Canadian Bar Association</i> permits a lawyer to
    investigate prospective jurors to ascertain any basis for challenge, but the
    lawyer must not directly or indirectly communicate with the prospective juror
    or any member of his or her family, and disclose any information acquired to
    the presiding judge and opposing counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In express terms or by necessary implication, both sets
    of <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i> permit inquiries about prospective jurors to ascertain any basis for challenge
    and use of the results of those inquiries as the basis for a challenge. The <i>Rules</i> require disclosure of any
    information obtained to both the presiding judge and opposing counsel and bar
    any direct or indirect communication with the prospective jurors or members of
    their family.  The scope of permitted
    inquiry would include investigations about criminal records.  Impermissible inquiries contravene a
    fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system: <i>R. v. Latimer</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.

  <h3>The
    Disclosure Obligations of the Prosecutor</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor’s disclosure obligation extends to all
    relevant, non-privileged information relating to the investigation of the
    accused and within the prosecution’s control: <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    17; <i>R. v. Chaplin</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R.
    727, at p. 739; <i>R. v. Egger</i>, [1993] 2
    S.C.R. 451, at pp. 465-66.  Relevant
    information includes not only information related to what the prosecutor
    proposes to adduce in evidence, but also any information in respect of which
    there is a reasonable possibility that it may assist the accused in exercising
    the right to make full answer and defence:  <i>McNeil </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    17; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Stinchcombe</span></i>,
    [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at pp. 343-44.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The disclosure obligations of the prosecutor are well
    defined. Circumscribed, not infinite. Those obligations are not co-extensive
    with the entire storehouse of information, knowledge and experience, in brief
    the stock-in-trade a prosecutor may acquire by exposure to daily appearances in
    the courts and interactions with the police, witnesses, victims and the
    communities at large in their jurisdiction.  Equality of knowledge and community intelligence, like equivalence in
    skill and experience as between opposing counsel in a criminal trial, is not a
    constitutional requirement or a principle of fundamental justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The disclosure obligation imposed upon the prosecutor
    becomes engaged by a request from the person(s) charged: <i>McNeil </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 17.  An accused <span class=GramE>who</span> learns of a disclosure failure or receives delayed disclosure of relevant
    information at trial must alert the trial judge to the failure or delay at the
    earliest opportunity and seek relief for it: <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span> at p. 341. Failure of
    defence counsel at trial to identify disclosure delays or defaults is a
    significant factor in determining on appeal whether the failure of or delay in
    prosecutorial disclosure affected the fairness of the trial process: <i>R. v. Dixon</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 37; <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span> at p. 341.</p>
  
  
  
  
  <h3>Appellate
    Remedies <span class=GramE>For</span> Disclosure Delays and Defaults</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an appellant alleges a disclosure delay or
    default on an appeal from conviction, the reviewing court must determine not
    only whether the subject-matter of the complaint met the <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span> test for disclosure,
    but also whether the prosecutor’s delay or default in disclosure impaired the
    appellant’s right to make full answer and defence: <i>Dixon </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 31. An inquiry into
    infringement comes first, to be followed by an analysis of impact where a case
    of infringement has been made out. The applicable remedy depends on the extent
    to which the right was impaired: <i>Dixon </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 31.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An appellant who invokes non-disclosure as a ground of
    appeal against conviction must establish, on a balance of probabilities, a
    violation of the right to disclosure and consequent impairment of the right to
    make full answer and defence: <i>Dixon</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 33.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To demonstrate an impairment of the right to make full
    answer and defence as a result of a default or delay in disclosure, an
    appellant must establish a <i>reasonable
    possibility</i> that the delayed or failed disclosure affected the outcome at
    trial or the overall fairness of the trial process: <i>Dixon </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 34; <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span> at p. 348; <i>R. v. C. (M. H.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 763,
    at p. 776.  The reasonable possibility
    that the appellant is required to demonstrate must not be entirely speculative,
    rather must be grounded on reasonably possible uses of the non-disclosed
    evidence, or reasonably possible avenues of investigation that were closed to
    the appellant as the result of the default or delay in disclosure: <i>Dixon </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    34.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To assess the effect of any disclosure delay or deficit
    on the <i>reliability</i> of the result of
    the trial, we must examine the undisclosed information to determine the impact
    it might have made on the decision to convict: <i>Dixon</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 36; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Taillefer</span></i>; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Duguay</span></i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 81 (later, <span class=SpellE><i>Taillefer</i></span>). The appellant shoulders the onus of
    demonstrating that there is a reasonable possibility that the verdict might
    have been different but for the prosecutor’s disclosure default or delay: <span
class=SpellE><i>Taillefer</i></span><i> </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 81.
    The appellate court will determine whether there was a reasonable possibility
    that the jury, with a benefit of all the relevant evidence, might have had a
    reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt: <span class=SpellE><i>Taillefer</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    82.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To evaluate the reasonable possibility that
    nondisclosure affected the <i>overall
    fairness</i> of an appellant’s trial requires us to examine <i>reasonably</i> possible uses of the
    non-disclosed information or <i>reasonably </i>possible
    avenues of investigation closed to an appellant because of the non-disclosure: <i>Dixon </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    34; <span class=SpellE><i>Taillefer</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 84.  An important factor to consider in this trial fairness analysis is the
    position of trial counsel.  If defence
    counsel knew or ought to have known on the basis of other  disclosure that the prosecutor had failed to
    disclose information, yet remained passive for tactical reasons or want of due
    diligence, a submission that non-disclosure affected trial fairness may be
    untenable: <i>Dixon</i> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 38.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Essential to the overall fairness of a criminal jury
    trial is a jury that is and appears impartial in their determination of the
    adequacy of the prosecutor’s proof.  Neither the composition nor the conduct of the jury should give rise to
    a reasonable apprehension of bias.  The <span
class=GramE>intention of the prosecutor in exercising peremptory challenges, as
    well as the prosecutor’s belief about the overall disposition of the jury, are</span> not dispositive of the bias issue.  To
    sustain a claim of a lack of trial fairness based on a reasonable apprehension
    of bias, the composition of the jury must be such that it leaves the
    well-informed observer with a reasonable apprehension of bias in favour of the
    prosecution: <i>R. v. Biddle</i> (1993), 84
    C.C.C. (3d) 430 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 443-44.</p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What remains is the application of the controlling
    principles to the singular circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Propriety of Criminal Record Checks</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prospective jurors may be ineligible to serve in a
    trial jury under provincial law or subject to challenge under s. 638(1)(c) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> if they have
    unpardoned convictions of certain criminal offences. Each person selected for
    consideration as a prospective juror is asked, and required to answer truthfully
    on a questionnaire, whether she or he has been convicted of an indictable
    offence for which she or he has not been granted a pardon. The questionnaire
    includes the prospective juror’s name and address but does not contain or seek
    disclosure of the prospective juror’s date of birth or other identifiers. A
    respondent who admits a previous unpardoned conviction for an indictable
    offence is <i>not </i>asked to provide any
    details about any prior conviction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prospective jurors whose previous convictions fall outside
    the sweep of s. 4(b) of the <i>Juries Act</i> remain eligible for jury service under provincial law.  But a party may challenge the prospective
    juror on the basis of a conviction that falls within s. 638(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, for example an unpardoned
    conviction for a summary conviction offence that attracted a sentence of
    imprisonment that exceeded 12 months.  The truth of the challenge for cause under s. 638(1)(c), like that of a
    challenge for cause based on lack of indifference under s. 638(1)(b), is determined
    by two <span class=SpellE>triers</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine the truth of a challenge for cause under
    s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b), the party challenging the prospective
    juror adduces evidence, the answers provided by the prospective juror to
    questions asked by challenging counsel.  The <span class=SpellE>triers</span> make their decision on the truth of
    the challenge on the basis of their assessment of the evidence and the
    instructions of the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine the truth of a challenge for cause under
    s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) also requires evidence, of a prior
    conviction and a sentence of imprisonment of more than 12 months.  To ensure consistency with what is required
    when the challenge is made under s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b), the
    challenger under s. 638(1)(c) must demonstrate a realistic potential of a
    disqualifying conviction before that party will be entitled to proceed with the
    challenge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior convictions may affect juror eligibility. They
    may also affect juror qualifications. To demonstrate either ineligibility or
    disqualification requires evidence.  It
    follows logically that the parties should be entitled to make inquiries about
    prospective jurors to ensure that they are neither ineligible nor unqualified
    for service because of prior convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In practical terms, as between the parties in a
    criminal prosecution, only the prosecutor has access to the means by which to
    conduct criminal records checks on prospective jurors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The RCMP <span class=GramE>maintain</span> a national
    system that includes information about persons convicted of crime.  Local police forces and other accredited
    agencies have access to this information. Other persons, whether organizations
    or individuals cannot obtain this information. Access to this system does not
    guarantee an answer to every query, much less an accurate response.  To ensure accuracy of the response, the
    inquirer needs some details about the subject of the inquiry. Full name. Date
    of birth. FPS number.  Fingerprints. The
    less complete the descriptors, the less likely a response, all the more an
    accurate answer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury panel lists lack crucial information to ensure
    accuracy in the results of those inquiries. Hence the need to consult other
    sources for essential information such as dates of birth. But this need for
    further identifiers to ensure accuracy of information about criminal records
    cannot justify wide-ranging inquiries to equip the prosecutor with the
    wherewithal to select jurors favourably disposed towards the prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown Attorney requested record checks of
    prospective jurors in this case.  No
    birthdates were provided.  But the Crown Attorney
    had another request: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would also be helpful if comments could be made
    concerning any disreputable persons we would not want as a juror.  All we can ask is that you do your best
    considering the lack of information available to us.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the scope of the Crown Attorney’s request, the
    material filed reveals that the purpose of the police inquiries was to
    determine whether a prospective juror had a criminal record. In the absence of
    fingerprints, investigators obtained dates of birth from the MTO database, <span
class=GramE>then</span> entered the details into a national database that
    records criminal convictions. These inquiries confirmed prior convictions or
    revealed none.  In some instances, the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of this case reveal no colourable use
    of legitimate criminal record checks of prospective jurors to obtain a
    favourable jury.  <span class=SpellE>McConachie</span> performed most of the checks.  He
    confined himself to criminal records.  It
    was not his job, he said, to check for anything beyond criminal records, nor
    his business, as he saw it, to help determine who should be on the jury. Det.
    Sgt. Anthony reviewed the content of any results returned in any of the
    databases he used and may have printed it. The information could have included
    a criminal record search, occurrence and arrest reports or other police contact
    information contained in other databases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The material gathered in response to the criminal

    Disclosure Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent acknowledges that acquisition and
    possession of information acquired about the criminal records of potential
    jurors imposed an obligation on the prosecutor to disclose to the appellants at
    trial at least any positive results of the inquiries.  The respondent is right to acknowledge this
    obligation, which is consistent with a draft Ministry memo of April 26, 2005 and
    the subsequent policy memo of March 31, 2006, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is the duty of Crown counsel to attempt to
    obtain a jury that is impartial, not a jury that is favourable to its
    position.  Further, the issue of
    impartiality between the Crown and the accused is not determined by whether the
    potential juror has personal opinions of one sort or another on matters
    peripheral to the case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In choosing a jury, both Crown counsel and defence
    should have access to the same background information material.  To that end, results of criminal record
    checks of potential jurors, if obtained by Crown counsel, should be disclosed
    to defence counsel. Crown counsel should not request police to undertake any
    further or other investigation into the list of jurors.  Crown counsel should not request police to
    conduct out-of-court investigations into private aspects of potential jurors’
    lives.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Any concrete information provided by police to
    Crown counsel suggesting that a prospective juror may not be impartial should
    be disclosed to the defence.  If
    background information relating to a prospective juror raises the issue of
    whether he/she is able to judge the case without bias, prejudice or partiality,
    Crown counsel should utilize the challenge for cause process to address these
    concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No complaint about non-disclosure occurs in the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel are to bring to the attention of the
    presiding judge, at the earliest opportunity, any prosecutorial failure or
    delay in disclosure of which counsel becomes aware. When <span class=GramE>counsel
    do</span> so, the trial judge is well-situated to gauge the impact of the
    default and to determine an appropriate and just remedy for it in the
    circumstances revealed at trial: <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span><i> </i>at p.
    341. As I have already indicated, lack of due diligence, reflected in a failure
    to complain, is an important factor in determining in an appellate forum
    whether a new trial should be ordered: <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span> at p. 341; <i>Dixon</i> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 37, 39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as early as February 24, 2005, during the <span class=SpellE>tiering</span> procedure that preceded the formal challenge
    process, the prosecutor indicated that a prospective juror might have a prior
    conviction for an indictable offence. What the prosecutor said then would lead
    a reasonable person to conclude that a criminal records check had been
    conducted and a record found that the prosecutor wished to confirm with the
    prospective juror.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few days later, during the selection process, another
    prospective juror told the judge that he had been “charged with things”.  Both the trial judge and prospective juror
    assumed aloud that inquiries would have been made concerning his
    eligibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About six weeks later, on April 22, 2005, copies of Det.
    Sgt. Anthony’s notes from September 13, 2004, until April 19, 2005, were
    disclosed to defence counsel. The notes disclosed his role in vetting the jury
    list at the prosecutor’s request. The names of the prospective jurors, the
    database consulted and the results of the inquiries were noted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Silence was the only response from defence counsel. No
    complaint of non-disclosure. No suggestion of any compromise of the right to
    make full answer and defence. Nor request for disclosure.  Nor application for a mistrial or other
    remedy.  Not a peep from a quintet of
    experienced defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the failure of counsel at trial to pursue
    disclosure assumes a place of prominence. The subject first emerged before any
    prospective juror was challenged and was repeated during selection. Specific details
    were provided in Det. Sgt. Anthony’s notes six weeks later. The trial did not
    conclude for another eight months and before its conclusion, counsel for Duong
    sought to cross-examine Det. Sgt. Anthony on why he had spent so little time
    investigating a third party suspect when he had squandered so many resources on
    investigating the prospective jurors.  Knowing silence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Silence or protest, the prosecutor defaulted on his
    obligation to disclose that prospective jurors had or may have prior criminal
    convictions. This criminal record information was something that could have
    been used by defence counsel in making decisions about the exercise of peremptory
    challenges. That said<span class=GramE>,</span> it surpasses reason to suggest
    that negative results of criminal record inquiries would have been of any
    appreciable value to defence counsel, irrespective of the order of challenge.
    Positive results, even of “possible criminal record”, would seem unlikely to
    have affected defence challenges, except perhaps where defence counsel were
    required to challenge first when counsel could reasonably expect the prosecutor
    would challenge later. That did not happen in this case. Prospective jurors
    with connections to law enforcement or persons involved in the trial showed no
    hesitation in disclosing these connections before the formal challenge process
    began.</p>
  <h3>The Impact
    of Non-disclosure</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To assess the impact of non-disclosure on the trial
    process, recall that the right to disclosure is but one component of the right
    to make full answer and defence: <i>Dixon </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 31.  Every
    violation of the right to disclosure does not impair the right to make full
    answer and defence: <i>Dixon </i>at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 31.  The <i>Charter</i> claimant must prove, on the
    balance of probabilities, that a <i>Charter</i> right has been infringed. In this case, the appellants must show not only that
    the undisclosed information meets the <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span><i> </i>standard,
    but also that the failure to disclose it impaired their right to make full
    answer and defence: <i>Dixon</i> at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 31-32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the appellants have failed to meet
    the second and crucial requirement, namely impairment of their right to make
    full answer and defence.  In this case,
    they have failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the
    non-disclosure affected either the outcome of the trial or the overall fairness
    of the trial process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The information not disclosed here was the result of
    inquiries to determine whether members of the jury panel, thus prospective
    jurors, had a criminal record that would render them ineligible for service
    under provincial law or subject to challenge for cause under s. 638(1)(c) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>. What <span
class=GramE>was</span> not disclosed was not evidence, let alone evidence that
    was relevant, material and admissible at the appellants’ trial.  The evidence upon which the jury rendered its
    verdict, to convict the appellants and to acquit the remaining co-accused,
    would not have varied a scintilla had disclosure of the result of the criminal record
    inquiries been made in a timely way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The undisclosed information had nothing to say about
    the nature and extent of the participation of any appellant in the offences
    charged. It offered neither contradiction nor qualification of evidence at
    trial, testimonial or documentary. Indeed, what was not disclosed could not
    even have made its way into the case for the prosecution or <span class=GramE>defence.</span>  Irrelevant. Immaterial.  And inadmissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The undisclosed information did not affect the outcome
    at <span class=GramE>trial, that</span> is the reliability of the appellants’
    convictions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But undisclosed information may infringe an appellant’s
    right to make full answer and defence in another way: by its effect on the
    overall fairness of the trial process that led to the findings of guilt: <i>Dixon</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    36.  Typically, what is involved here is
    an assessment, once again on the basis of reasonable possibility, not fevered
    imaginings or unbridled speculation, of the lines of inquiry that could have
    been pursued with witnesses or the opportunities to gather additional
    information that could have been available to the defence had any or timely
    disclosure been made: <i>Dixon</i> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 36.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the impact of non-disclosure on the
    overall fairness of the trial process, we must take into account defence
    counsel’s diligence in pursuing disclosure from the prosecutor. A lack of due
    diligence is a significant factor in determining whether prosecutorial
    non-disclosure affected the fairness of the trial process: <i>Dixon</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 37; <span class=SpellE><i>Stinchcombe</i></span> at p. 341.  In some instances, to do nothing in the face
    of knowledge that relevant information has not been disclosed will, at a
    minimum, justify a finding of lack of due diligence and may support an
    inference that counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue disclosure: <i>Dixon</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    55.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, I am not satisfied that the
    non-disclosure affected the overall fairness of the trial process to such an
    extent that it impaired the right of the appellants to make full answer and
    defence.  A new trial is not warranted on
    this ground.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, this is <i>not</i> a case in which the appellants only learned about non-disclosure of the record
    checks of prospective jurors after verdict.  Far from it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 24, 2005, during the <span class=SpellE>tiering</span> process that preceded challenges for cause and peremptory challenges, the
    prosecutor raised the prospect that a potential juror had a previous conviction
    and lamented the failure of the jury panel lists to include dates of birth to
    ensure that the convicted person and juror were one and the same.  It beggars the imagination to come to any
    conclusion other than that this disclosure signalled that record checks had
    been conducted of prospective jurors. Five experienced defence counsel did
    nothing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few days later, when another prospective juror
    revealed that he had been charged a few times, both the prospective juror and
    the trial judge <i>assumed</i> that
    appropriate checks would have been done. Again, five experienced defence
    counsel made no inquiry and sought no disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When copies of the notes of Det. Sgt. Anthony were
    disclosed to defence counsel on April 22, 2005, about six weeks after jury
    selection and eight months before the end of the trial, the five experienced
    defence counsel had written confirmation of the fact and results of the record
    checks done by Detective Sgt. Anthony. <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>A</span>gain,
    not a whisper of complaint, a request for further disclosure, a suggestion of
    impairment of the right to make full answer and defence, or a request for a
    remedy.  One would be naïve to think
    that, had the non-disclosure been of such significance as it is now said to
    have assumed, that six weeks into a nine-month trial defence counsel would not
    have done something about it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The commencement and pursuit of appellate proceedings
    raised no issue of non-disclosure, much less its effect on the reliability of
    the result or the overall fairness of the trial process. Indeed, what <span
class=GramE>appears</span> to have attracted the appellants’ attention was
    media reports of “jury vetting” by the prosecutors in another case in the venue
    of trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only use five experienced trial counsel sought to
    make of the record checks of prospective jurors emerged in the
    cross-examination of Det. Sgt. Anthony at trial.  Trial counsel for Duong contrasted the
    officer’s efforts in “checking out” prospective jurors with his lack of effort
    in pursuing an alleged third party suspect. The trial judge did not permit the
    witness to answer the question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellate record continues the silence of trial
    counsel. Nothing about their knowledge of the record checks. Nothing about
    their failure to seek disclosure or a remedy for its failure.  And nothing to suggest that the failure
    impaired the ability of any appellant to make full answer and defence at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The non-disclosure had no effect on the adjudication of
    guilt in the traditional sense.  The
    subject-matter of the non-disclosure had nothing to say about the cogency of
    the prosecutor’s case and could not have opened up any further lines of inquiry
    or led to the gathering of additional evidence for consideration by the <span
class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The undisclosed information related exclusively to the
    jury selection process, in particular the exercise of peremptory challenges.
    Apprised of this information in respect of any prospective juror who was not excused,
    deferred, declared ineligible because of prior convictions or successfully
    challenged for cause under either s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) or
    (1)(c)  and in respect of whom the
    defence was required to declare first, defence counsel <i>might</i> not have challenged peremptorily in the expectation that the
    prosecutor would do so because of the prior record. But we know from the fresh
    evidence record that this possibility never became reality. No one exhausted
    all their challenges and the defence never challenged first in connection with
    a prospective juror who police inquiries revealed had or may have had a prior
    criminal record.  There is no reasonable
    possibility that the jury would have been constituted differently had
    disclosure been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peremptory challenges are an important part of the jury
    selection process.  Unlike challenges for
    cause, that rest upon allegations of lack of impartiality that must be
    established by evidence adduced by the challenging party, peremptory challenges
    require no justification or explanation, much less an evidentiary foundation or
    proof.  The very basis upon which
    peremptory challenges are founded is subjective, not objective: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Cloutier</span></i>,
    [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709, at pp. 720-21.  Peremptory challenges rest upon no firmer foundation than a mere belief,
    more often a hunch, of a party that within the prospective juror resides a
    state of mind at odds with impartiality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jury selection is not a science.  Anyone who has ever prosecuted, defended or
    tried a criminal case with a jury has their own views about the basis upon
    which to exercise a peremptory challenge. Occupation.  Education. Mode of dress. Age. None are
    verifiable empirically. Many, if not most, cannot withstand objective analysis.
    Peremptory challenges permit a party to remove from jury service a limited
    number of persons whom the party believes, in the circumstances of the case to
    be tried, may not reach an impartial, evidence-driven conclusion.  The availability of peremptory challenges
    fosters confidence in the adjudicative fairness of the criminal jury
    trial.  Parties often exercise peremptory
    challenges in an attempt to secure what they hope will be a sympathetic jury.
    The equalization of the number of peremptory challenges available to both
    parties tends to ensure that neither gains an unfair advantage over the other in
    this aspect of jury selection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record in this case is barren of any support for a
    claim that non-disclosure of the criminal record checks caused <i>actual</i> unfairness in the peremptory
    challenge aspect of the jury selection process, thereby in the trial itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if undisclosed information may infringe an
    appellant’s right to make full answer and defence by its effect on the <i>appearance</i> of overall fairness of the
    trial process, the appellants cannot succeed in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The number of challenges remaining to the parties when
    jury selection was completed cannot support an inference, in light of the
    record, that the selection process had the appearance of unfairness. That
    defence counsel, for their own reasons, would exercise significantly more of
    their available peremptory challenges than the prosecutor is scarcely
    remarkable, let alone indicative of any semblance of unfairness as a result of
    non-disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a case like <i>R. v. Latimer</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217 in which the undisclosed
    information revealed <i>direct</i> contact
    with prospective jurors and solicitation of their views and beliefs about
    subject-matters related to issues likely to arise at trial. Five persons who
    were administered the questionnaire that solicited their views on these
    subjects served on the jury. It was in that context that the Court considered
    that the interference with prospective jurors contravened a fundamental tenet
    of the criminal justice system: that justice should not only be done, but
    should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done: <i>Latimer</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of this case differ significantly
    from the circumstances in which <i>R. v.
    Hobbs</i>, 2010 NSCA 62 was decided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In<i> Hobbs</i>, the
    prosecutor asked the police to check both the Canadian Police Information
    Centre<i> </i>(CPIC) and the Justice
    Enterprise Information Network (JEIN) to determine whether any prospective
    jurors had criminal records.  The
    prosecutor asked that the jury panel members be categorized as panel members</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>with criminal records and whether of serious

'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>with</span> potential but
    unconfirmed criminal records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The information provided to the prosecutor was a factor
    in the prosecutor’s decision to challenge five prospective jurors peremptorily.
    The information was not provided to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hobbs</i>,
    Crown counsel conceded on appeal: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>i</span></span>.          that
    the information obtained by the police should have been disclosed to the
    appellant;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            ii.         that, had the information been
    disclosed, there was a reasonable possibility that the defence would have
    executed its peremptory challenges differently in respect of two prospective
    jurors, and thereby preserved two peremptory challenges rather than exhausting
    all their challenges;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            iii.       <span class=GramE>that</span>, had the
    information been disclosed, the jury would have been differently constituted;
    and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            iv.        <span class=GramE>that</span> the appeal
    should be allowed and a new trial ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Critical to the decision in <i>Hobbs</i> are two factors that are absent here. First, an affirmative
    finding, based on a concession by Crown counsel, that non-disclosure had an <i>actual</i> impact on the jury
    selection.  <i>Hobbs</i> exhausted his peremptory challenges. That is not this case. Second, <i>Hobbs </i>had no inkling that the
    prosecutor had requested record checks of prospective jurors and received the
    results of those checks.  That is also
    not this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CHARGE GROUNDS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants allege several deficiencies, both errors
    and omissions, in the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury.  The charge was delivered orally.  Each juror was also provided with a written
    copy of the complete charge, together with verdict sheets and decision trees.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt;text-transform:uppercase;'>THE <i>VETROVEC</i> CAUTION AND RELATED ISSUES</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each appellant has a complaint about the <span
class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>cautions contained in the final
    instructions.  All say that the caution
    relating to the testimony of Minh Dang was inadequate.  Duong contends that the instruction in
    connection with the testimony of Long <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span> was also
    deficient.  <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> argues that the trial judge was wrong in giving a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>warning or its equivalent for the testimony of members of his family
    that was supportive of his defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some background is necessary to situate the complaints
    in their proper context. </p>
  
  
  
  <h3>The
    Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Minh Dang was a fully involved co-conspirator and an
    eyewitness to the killings of both deceased.  She lured the deceased to the place where the killings were to occur
    with full knowledge of what lay ahead.  Originally a co-accused, she was permitted to plead guilty to the lesser
    offence of manslaughter and a single count of conspiracy part way through the
    preliminary inquiry.  She received a
    lenient sentence for her involvement and testified for the prosecution at
    trial.  Her testimony was essential to and
    occupied a central place in the prosecution’s case against the appellants and
    their co-accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Minh Dang testified at trial for 14 days.  In their closing submissions, trial counsel
    for the appellants branded her a “liar”, a “pathological liar”, an “unmitigated
    liar”, an “accomplished actress” and a “Jezebel”, amongst other things.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Long <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span> was an associate of
    the appellant Duong.  He and others
    brought the murder weapon to Buffalo from San Jose, California, turned it over
    to Genevieve Ward for transport into Canada, <span class=GramE>then</span> entered Canada themselves.  <span
class=SpellE>Dinh</span> received immunity in return for his testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four members of the appellant <span class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> family testified at trial. Only April <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> was a
    defence witness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Ajnet</span> and <span class=SpellE>Elmosa</span> <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> had provided statements to the police that, if
    repeated in substance under oath, would have been of considerable value to the
    prosecutor’s case.  Both recanted.
    Despite unswerving allegiance to their recantations, and their best efforts to
    do otherwise, their trial evidence did provide some support for the
    prosecution’s case, including proving access to a van used to facilitate the
    killings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Adem</span> <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> was also a prosecution witness. He refused to adopt a prior intercepted
    telephone conversation in which he discussed what to do with a ring taken from
    Bui on the night she was killed.  His
    testimony did establish a prior link between Glen and Cardoso.</p>
  <h3>The Jury
    Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge warned the jury that neither Dang’s
    pleas of guilty nor the sentence she received afforded evidence of the guilt of
    anyone else on trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the heading, <i>Caution
    Concerning Minh Dang’s Testimony</i>, the trial judge instructed the jury:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          that it
    was <i>very dangerous</i> to convict any
    accused on the basis of         Minh
    Dang’s evidence alone; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         that they should look for independent
    evidence that confirmed what      Minh
    Dang said before acting upon her evidence; but</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       <span class=GramE>they</span> could act
    on her testimony alone if they believed it and found it     trustworthy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, over 19 pages of transcript, pointed
    out the reasons underlying the caution, including the myriad lies Dang had told
    to the police and under oath, and the fact that she had been permitted to plead
    guilty to a lesser offence and received a lenient sentence.  He listed several items of evidence that were
    potentially confirmatory of her testimony, but limited the confirmatory
    potential of each appellant’s statements to confirmation in relation to their
    maker only.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also cautioned the jury about relying
    on the testimony of Long <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span>.  He described <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span> as a co-conspirator who had never been charged as a result of his involvement
    in providing the gun to be used in the killings. <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span> admitted embellishing his testimony about what happened to the gun and expressed
    his wish to protect his friend and fellow gun trafficker, Van Lam.  The judge told the jurors to look at <span
class=SpellE>Dinh’s</span> testimony with the greatest of care and caution and
    to seek confirmation of it from somebody or something other than <span
class=SpellE>Dinh</span> before relying on it in the case against any
    accused.  The trial judge offered some
    illustrations of potentially confirmatory testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In connection with the <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> family witnesses, the trial judge told the jury that inconsistencies in their
    testimony, both internally and among their various versions, their reluctance
    to answer questions and inconsistencies between their evidence and that of
    others afforded good reason to consider parts of their evidence with the
    greatest care and caution. The judge then instructed the jury to look for some
    confirmation of the evidence of these witnesses before relying upon it in
    deciding whether the Crown had proven its case against the accused beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  The trial judge did
    not provide any illustrations of potentially confirmatory evidence.</p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cardoso and Duong contend that the caution about Dang’s
    testimony was inadequate because it failed to point out two critical features
    that signalled the need for caution:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          the
    inconsistency between Dang’s evidence and the incontrovertible     forensic findings at the scene of the
    killings; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         Dang’s access to disclosure, as a
    former co-accused who participated in the
    preliminary hearing prior to her guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The caution, they contend, was
    generally unrepresentative of the defects in Dang’s evidence and overstated its
    strength.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For his part, <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> takes the
    position that the instruction about the lack of evidentiary value associated
    with Dang’s guilty plea diluted its impact (as a benefit given to Dang) as a
    relevant and important factor signalling the dangers associated with reliance upon
    Dang’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duong alone alleges that the caution given in relation
    to <span class=SpellE>Dinh’s</span> evidence was inadequate: too weak to
    satisfy the requirements of <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> and without any meaningful discussion of
    potentially confirmatory evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> challenges the
    propriety of the <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i>-</i>like caution given in relation to the
    testimony of members of his family. This evidence, he submits, was evidence
    critical to his defence, namely that the facially <span class=SpellE>inculpatory</span> statements he provided to police were involuntary, thus unreliable, given as a
    result of a promise by authorities so that his children could be removed to a
    place of safety.  Their evidence was
    exculpatory, did not engage the principles that underpin a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> warning, thus should not
    have attracted one according to <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent stands firmly behind the instructions
    given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent says that the caution relating to the
    testimony of Dang was adequate in every respect.  It pointed out the influence of the plea of
    guilty and sentence for a lesser offence as a factor underlying the need for
    caution. There was no need to point out any inconsistency between Dang’s
    version and the findings at the scene.  The jurors had the wherewithal to consider the congruity or incongruity
    of her testimony with the findings at the scene – the scene photos were
    exhibits. And they made that distinction when they acquitted Glen.  Neither was there any need to mention access
    to disclosure as accounting for the confirmation of Dang’s testimony by other
    evidence – most of the confirmation came from the testimony of Glen and Ward
    about which Dang could not have learned from disclosure. And what is more, Ms.
    Fairburn adds, the charge on confirmatory evidence was unduly favourable to the
    appellants because it segregated confirmation by accused, thus overriding the
    principle that evidence need not implicate an accused to be confirmatory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent contends that the caution in relation to
    the testimony of <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span> was adequate.  The crafting of the warning was a matter for
    the discretion of the trial judge.  No
    magic formula need be followed, nor incantation uttered. The warning was
    repeated when the trial judge reviewed Duong’s position for the jury.  Deference should prevail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> <span
class=GramE>family witnesses, Ms. Fairburn observes</span>, the complaint is
    made for the first time here.  Although
    some of the markers of <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> were used, the trial judge did not say that it was dangerous to act on their
    evidence or itemize the reasons underlying the need for caution.  There was, after all, some basis for caution
    in relation to those witnesses called by the prosecution. Their evidence was <span
class=SpellE>inculpatory</span> in some respects, as well self-contradictory
    and inconsistent with other testimony.  In every event, comments on credibility are not barred, even in
    connection with defence witnesses.</p>
  <h3><span>            </span>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central purpose of a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>instruction is to alert the jury about the danger of relying upon
    the testimony of unsavoury witnesses and to explain the reasons that underpin
    the need for special scrutiny of their testimony: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Khela</span></i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 11.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crafting a caution appropriate to the unique
    circumstances of an individual case is best left to the judge presiding at
    trial.  No particular combination of
    words is essential, no pre-ordained formula compulsory: <span class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    13; <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 146,
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 16.  Each case is different.  The
    cautionary instructions should respond to and reflect the circumstances of the
    case: <span class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 14.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four elements guide trial judges in the composition of <span
class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> warnings
    about the testimony of potentially untrustworthy witnesses:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          <i>identification </i>of the <i>witness</i> whose evidence requires special    scrutiny;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         <i>explanation</i> of the <i>reasons</i> why the evidence is
    subject to special        scrutiny;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       a <i>caution</i> that it is dangerous to convict on unconfirmed evidence of    this kind, though jurors are entitled to do
    so if they are satisfied that          the
    evidence is true; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.        <span class=GramE><i>advice</i></span><i> </i>to the jury
    that, in determining the veracity of the suspect           evidence, they should look for evidence from another source
    tending     to show that the untrustworthy
    witness is telling the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE><i>Khela</i></span></span><span
class=GramE> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.</span> <span class=GramE>37; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Kehler</span></i>,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 328, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.</span> <span

class=SpellE>at</span> para. 82.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In some cases, a relevant factor for a trial judge to
    consider in determining whether to give a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> warning in connection
    with the testimony of a particular witness is preferential treatment given to
    the witness in connection with his or her involvement in the offence. That the
    witness has changed positions from co-accused to prosecution <span class=GramE>witness,</span> and the circumstances in which that change came about, for example by entry of
    a plea with prosecutorial consent to a lesser offence, may favour a <span
class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>warning. Nothing should be said that
    expressly or by necessary implication removes such treatment as a factor
    signalling caution and worthy of specific mention by the trial judge: <i>R. v. Chenier </i>(2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d)
    333 (Ont. C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>caution that displays the characteristics described in paragraph
    155 and contains no other flaw will survive appellate review: <span
class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 44.  Content
    controls, not form. What matters is that the instruction serves its intended
    purpose: <span class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 13.  Sometimes, deficiencies in a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> caution itself may be compensated for by other
    passages in the charge: <span class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 52.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Something should be said about the nature of
    confirmatory evidence and the obligation of the trial judge to instruct jurors
    about it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be confirmatory of the testimony of a witness whose
    evidence is subject to a<i> <span
class=SpellE>Vetrovec</span> </i>caution, the evidence must be independent of
    the <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>witness. Said in another way,
    confirmatory evidence must come from some source other than the tainted
    witness. To be confirmatory, this independent evidence need not implicate the
    accused. But the independent evidence must be capable of restoring the faith of
    the <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact in relevant aspects of the tainted
    witness’ account: <span class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 12 and 16; <span class=SpellE><i>Kehler</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    41. Where the only issue is whether the accused committed the offence,
    confirmatory evidence should provide comfort for the <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact that the tainted witness is telling the truth <i>in</i> <i>that regard</i>: <span
class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jury instructions should make clear the type of
    evidence capable of offering support for the testimony of the tainted
    witness.  The list of potentially
    confirmatory evidence may be illustrative rather than exhaustive, but the jury
    should not simply be turned loose to roam the evidentiary landscape for
    anything that it feels confirms the truth of the witness’ testimony:  <span class=SpellE><i>Khela</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=FR-CA>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    further points. <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> cautions are limited to witnesses called on behalf of the prosecution and
    relied upon to establish an <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> guilt: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Suzack</span></i> (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    186.  <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> warnings must not be
    given in relation to defence witnesses, although a trial judge is entitled to
    comment on the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of their evidence,
    including defence witnesses: <span class=SpellE><i>Suzack</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. <span lang=FR-CA>189; <i>R.

  <h3><span lang=FR-CA>The <span class=SpellE>Principles</span> <span
class=SpellE>Applied</span></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to any of the specific
    complaints of errors or omissions in connection with the <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>or <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span>-like
    instructions in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> warning in connection with the evidence of Minh
    Dang contained all four elements that inform the content of <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>warnings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the instruction drew the jury’s attention to her
    evidence as the testimony of a witness that the jury should approach with “the
    greatest care and caution”. Jurors were instructed that it was “very dangerous”
    for them to convict <i>any</i> accused on
    the uncorroborated evidence of Minh Dang standing on its own. The jurors were
    told to look for confirmation before accepting any of her testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge explained why the jury should
    subject Minh Dang’s evidence to this enhanced scrutiny. She was a named
    co-conspirator who had previously been a co-accused.  She had pleaded guilty to a lesser offence
    and received a lesser sentence.  She had
    admittedly lied to investigators and under oath.  She was described as a “pathological
    liar”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial judge told the jury that it was very
    dangerous to convict anyone on Minh Dang’s evidence alone, but that they could
    do so if they believed it and found it to be trustworthy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the trial judge advised the jury that they
    should look for evidence from another source tending to show that Dang was
    telling the truth before relying on her testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge explained to the jury that to be
    confirmatory of the testimony of Minh Dang evidence must come from somebody or
    something else.  He illustrated several items
    of potentially confirmatory evidence, all of it independent of Minh Dang’s
    testimony, and left it to the jury to determine whether they considered this
    evidence confirmatory and whether they would act on Minh Dang’s testimony
    confirmed or on its own.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an earlier portion of his charge, the trial judge
    instructed the jury, as he was required to do, that Minh Dang’s pleas of guilty
    to manslaughter and conspiracy to commit murder did <i>not</i> constitute evidence of any other person’s guilt.  Without such an instruction, there was a palpable
    danger that jurors would consider Minh Dang’s admission of guilt as an item of
    evidence supportive of the guilt of everyone else on trial as participants in
    the same criminal ventures.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge revisited the effect of Ms. Dang’s plea
    of guilty and the sentence imposed when he gave jurors a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> warning about reliance
    on her testimony.  He explained that the
    permitted plea and sentencing disposition <span class=SpellE>enured</span> to
    Ms. Dang’s benefit.  That benefit, the
    trial judge pointed out, was one of the reasons why the jury should approach
    her evidence with the greatest care and caution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellants also complain that the trial
    judge did not point out two other reasons why Minh Dang’s testimony should be
    approached with the greatest care and caution and not acted upon without
    independent confirmatory evidence, it is debatable whether a trial judge is
    required to list <i>every</i> reason that
    underlies the need for specific scrutiny of a witness’ evidence and requires a <span
class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> caution: <i>Smith</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    14.  The adequacy of the instruction is
    not measured by the number of items in the list of reasons for special
    scrutiny.  As I have indicated, what is
    more important is that what is said conveys to the jury <i>why</i> the evidence of a particular witness is singled out for special
    mention.  That was done here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The omissions of which specific complaint is made did
    not render the explanation offered for the need for special scrutiny
    deficient.  The jurors were
    well-equipped, by other testimony and exhibits, to determine whether and to what
    extent Dang’s testimony coincided with or differed from the physical findings
    at the scene.  It is clear that they did
    not render verdicts in lock-step with her evidence, witness the acquittal of
    Glen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In one respect at least, the charge about confirmatory
    evidence was overly favourable to the appellants. The trial judge limited the
    confirmatory potential of several items of evidence to individual appellants
    and accused. No such limitation should have been imposed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the caution relating to the testimony of Long <span class=SpellE>Dinh</span>, of which Duong complains, was adequate. The
    trial judge also instructed jurors to approach his evidence with the greatest
    care and caution. They were instructed to look for confirmation of his evidence
    from other sources. The trial judge gave illustrations of potentially
    confirmatory evidence. The reasons underlying the need for special scrutiny
    were drawn to the jury’s attention. The instructions attracted no objection at
    trial, nor can the complaints of inadequacy prevail here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another deficiency raised for the first time here
    concerns the cautionary instructions given about the evidence of several
    witnesses from the “<span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> family”. The appellant <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> did not testify. With the exception of April <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>, these “family” witnesses were called by the
    prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> provided several statements to the police. He sought
    their exclusion at trial.  He said the
    statements were involuntary.  The trial
    judge disagreed and admitted the statements in evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> took the
    position that the statements admitted by the trial judge as voluntary, were in
    fact involuntary because he had provided them to police as a <i>quid pro quo</i> to secure the safety of his
    children. Unsupported by his own testimony, <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> contended that evidence of his family members supported his claim that his
    children were unsafe in Ward’s home and, by extension, that his statements to
    the police were unreliable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent acknowledges that the <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> witnesses called for the Crown were “not classic
    unsavoury witnesses”, despite their recantation of highly <span class=SpellE>inculpatory</span> prior statements and testimony. That said<span class=GramE>,</span> these
    witnesses did provide some evidence helpful to the prosecution’s case. Their
    evidence painted the co-accused Genevieve Ward in a most unflattering light.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether to give and how to formulate a <span
class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span><i> </i>caution rests largely with the
    discretion of the judge presiding at a trial. While reasonable people may
    differ about the need for such a caution in respect of the <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> witnesses who testified for the prosecution, deference is owed to the trial
    judge on this issue. The instructions invited the jurors to seek confirmation
    of their evidence before relying upon it in deciding whether the case against
    the accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Trial counsel for <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> did not object to these instructions either before or after they were given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of these witnesses was highly prejudicial
    to Genevieve Ward. This was a joint trial.  It involved cutthroat defences.  The trial judge was required to consider Ms. Ward’s position, not just
    that of <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>, in deciding whether to provide a
    caution about this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> caution should <i>not </i>have been given in relation to April <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>, a
    defence witness. That said, the use that <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> sought
    to make of this evidence beggars the imagination. In the face of an
    overwhelming prosecution case, this instruction occasioned no prejudice.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%'>THE
    DURESS GROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge instructed the jury on the excuse of
    duress in connection with the appellant Duong’s participation as an <span
class=SpellE>aider</span> of the principals in a planned and deliberate first
    degree murder. The trial judge also left duress for the jury’s consideration in
    determining Duong’s liability on both counts of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
  <h3>The
    Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary support offered for the excuse of
    duress is a statement Duong provided to investigators on June 27, 2002.  Duong acknowledged that he knew about the
    plan to kill Ton.  He said that Dang had
    tried to involve him in the scheme, but that he had resisted her entreaties.  Dang told Duong that everything was in place
    for the killing.  She instructed Duong to
    pick her up at a predetermined place near the location selected for the
    murders.  If he did not do her bidding, according
    to Duong, Dang said, she would tell Ton, the intended <span class=GramE>victim,
    that Duong was “going to kill him [Ton]”</span>. Duong complied with Dang’s
    request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Duong did <i>not</i> testify at trial.  Nor
    did counsel for Duong attempt to have Ms. Dang confirm this threat Duong had
    told investigators about on June 27, 2002.</p>
  <h3><span>                        </span>The
    Jury Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge instructed the jury that duress could
    negative deliberation, thus reduce first degree murder to second degree murder
    if the jury had a reasonable doubt that Duong was acting under duress when he
    participated in the murder of the deceased.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also instructed the jury that duress
    could raise a reasonable doubt that Duong was a member of the conspiracy to
    murder the deceased.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants take no issue with the substance of the
    instructions on duress.  The trial judge
    accurately described the essential elements of duress and did not err in his
    instructions about the burden of proof associated with it.</p>
  <h3><span>                        </span>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the trial judge erred in
    instructing the jury that</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          duress
    cannot serve as an excuse for murder;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         duress may negate the requirement that
    a planned murder be       deliberate, thus
    reduce what otherwise would be first degree murder        to second degree murder; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       <span class=GramE>duress</span> may raise
    a reasonable doubt that a person, in this case the          appellant Duong, was a member of an otherwise established             conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent takes the position that the excuse of
    duress had no legitimate place in the trial judge’s final instructions. There
    was no air of reality to the excuse because there was no evidence capable of
    supporting each of the constituent elements of the excuse. The excuse never
    should have made its way into the final instructions.  It is of no moment that the judge erred in
    leaving duress as relevant to proof of deliberation.  Besides, duress is not available as an excuse
    for secondary participation in murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the respondent continues, the jury
    plainly rejected duress. They convicted Duong of first degree murder and
    conspiracy to commit murder.  Along the
    way, they rejected the influence of duress on which they were properly
    instructed.  No harm, no foul.</p>
  <h3><span>                        </span>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obligation imposed upon a trial judge to instruct a
    jury on a defence, justification or excuse is not absolute.  The duty becomes engaged when, but only when,
    there is evidence in the record at trial that provides an air of reality for
    the defence, justification or excuse. Where there is such an air of reality, a
    trial judge has a positive duty to put that defence, justification or excuse to
    the jury. A trial judge has a positive duty of equivalent importance to keep
    from the jury any defence, justification or excuse that lacks an air of
    reality: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Cinous</span></i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 51.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[196]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defences, justifications and excuses often include several
    elements. The air of reality test applies to each constituent element: <span
class=SpellE><i>Cinous</i></span> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. <span lang=FR-CA>95; <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Savoury</span></i> (2005), 200 C.C.C. (3d) 94 (Ont. C.A.), <span class=SpellE>at</span> para. </span>45.  What is required is that there <span
class=GramE>be</span> evidence upon which a jury could reasonably draw the
    inferences necessary for each constituent element, thus to found an acquittal
    on that basis: <span class=SpellE><i>Cinous</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 61 and 83.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essential elements of the excuse of duress include:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          a threat
    of death or serious bodily harm to the accused;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         a belief on the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> part that the threat could be carried out;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       the threat could cause a reasonable
    person in the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> position      to do as the accused did;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.        the accused had no safe avenue of escape;
    and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=GramE>v</span>.         the accused
    committed the offence only because of the threats of         death or serious bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span class=GramE><i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Hibbert</span></i>,
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.</span> <span
class=GramE>51-62.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In some instances, that a person commits an offence as
    a result of threats of death or serious bodily harm can be relevant to proof of
    the mental or fault element in the crime.  In those circumstances, an accused may rely on evidence of threats to
    contend that the prosecutor has not proven the necessary fault or mental
    element beyond a reasonable doubt: <span class=SpellE><i>Hibbert</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 45.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But duress is also an excuse.  Regardless of its relevance to proof of the
    mental or fault element, an accused may be able to invoke the statutory or
    common law excuse to escape conviction: <span class=SpellE><i>Hibbert</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 45.</p>
  <h3><span>                        </span></h3>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary foundation for the excuse of duress
    here is Dang’s threat to <i>tell</i> Ton
    that Duong was going to kill him [Ton]. Ton was to be killed that night. The
    plans were made.  The participants were
    in place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “threat” here was not of death or serious bodily
    harm, rather of disclosure to someone who was about to be murdered.  There was no evidence of its effect on Duong
    or that he attended at the designated place only because of that threat.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[202]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It surpasses reason to suggest that the evidence was
    capable of supporting an inference that Duong had no safe means of escape. No
    reasonable <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact could conclude otherwise
    than that Duong had several obvious and safe means of escape as he drove north
    on Highway 400 and onto Highway 11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The excuse of duress should not have been left to the
    jury.  The fact that it was, and the
    manner in which it was left for consideration, is not something of which any
    appellant can complain.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON SECONDARY PARTICIPATION
    AND INCLUDED           OFFENCES</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[204]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duong and Cardoso allege deficiencies in the trial
    judge’s final instructions on secondary participation and the included offences
    of second degree murder and manslaughter.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></h3>
  <h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>SECONDARY PARTICIPATION</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[205]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecution’s case against Duong was that he was deeply
    involved in the plan to murder the deceased, but played no active role in the
    actual killings.  His liability was left
    on the basis that he was an <span class=SpellE>aider</span> in a planned and
    deliberate murder and a full participant in the underlying conspiracy.  </p>
  <h3>The Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[206]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the complaint advanced by Duong in his
    factum, though not pressed in oral argument, does not require more than passing
    reference to what occurred at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[207]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duong defended the case against him on the basis that
    he did not participate as an <span class=SpellE>aider</span> in any planned and
    deliberate murders or other unlawful killings. He rejected Dang’s entreaties
    and made it clear that he did not want to be, nor was he involved.  His only complicity, with which he was not
    charged, was that he drove Dang away from the place at which the victims had
    been killed.</p>
  <h3>The Jury Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[208]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave jurors an overview of aiding, then
    a more elaborate instruction about the constituent elements of aiding.  He pointed out the need to prove that an
    accused <i>intended</i> to help another
    commit the offence, not merely that the accused did something that had that effect.
    He told the jurors that aiding related to a specific offence, one that the
    aider intends will be committed, or knows that another intends to commit and
    intends to help the other person commit it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[209]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge linked
    the aiding instructions to the essential elements of planned and deliberate
    first degree murder.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[210]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal complaint of the appellant Duong is that
    the trial judge provided only a cursory overview of what was required to
    constitute a person an <span class=SpellE>aider</span> in a principal’s
    crime.  The complaint was not pressed in
    oral argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[211]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the instructions adequately
    explained both the conduct and fault requirements of aiding and the manner in
    which Duong could be found guilty of first degree murder as an <span
class=SpellE>aider</span>.  Nothing more
    was required.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[212]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A person is a party to a crime as an <span
class=SpellE>aider</span> if that person does something that helps a principal
    commit the offence and provides the assistance with the intention of helping a
    principal to commit the offence: <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Almarales</span></i> (2008), 237 C.C.C. (3d) 148 (Ont. C.A.), at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 66. To be found guilty as an <span class=SpellE>aider</span> of a planned and deliberate first degree murder, a person must do something
    that helped a principal commit a planned and deliberate murder and provide that
    assistance with the intention of helping a principal commit a planned and
    deliberate murder: <span class=SpellE><i>Almarales</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 69.  The fault requirement involves both intention and knowledge. The aider
    may acquire knowledge about the planned and deliberate nature of the murder by
    participating in the planning and deliberation, or by some other means: <span
class=SpellE><i>Almarales</i></span> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 70.</p>
  <h3><span>            </span>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[213]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal moves no freight.  It is based upon a selective reading of the
    charge, rather than a consideration of it as a whole. The complaint faintly
    urged now attracted no objection at trial, either before or after the charge
    was delivered. The essential elements of aiding were well and fully explained
    by the trial judge and adequately integrated into instructions about the
    essential elements of the prosecution’s proof.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>            </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>SECOND DEGREE
    MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[214]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Duong and Cardoso submit that the trial judge
    erred in failing adequately to define manslaughter in his final
    instructions.  Cardoso also contends that
    the instructions on second degree murder were deficient.  </p>
  
  <h3>The
    Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[215]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The positions advanced at trial furnish important context
    for these complaints about inadequacies in final instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[216]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor alleged that Duong was an <span
class=SpellE>aider</span> in both killings that were planned and deliberate
    murders.  Duong participated, indeed was
    the prime mover in the plan to kill Ton.  It was Duong who alone had the financial motive to kill Ton and, along
    with him, Bui.  Duong knew that Bui would
    be with Ton. After all, Duong was intimately involved in the ruse executed by
    Dang to lure both to the place where they would be killed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[217]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor contended that Cardoso, along with Glen,
    participated in the killings as a principal. He was at the scene, struck the
    blows that killed Bui and was a principal in the shooting death of Ton.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[218]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duong acknowledged that he drove Dang away from the
    scene of the killings.  He was coerced to
    go there, he said, because Dang threatened to tell Ton that Duong planned to
    kill him (Ton).  Duong was admittedly an
    accessory after the fact to the murders, but not otherwise complicit in them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[219]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cardoso denied any liability.  He said that he was in British Columbia when the
    deceased were killed.   </p>
  <h3>The Jury Instructions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[220]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge approached his instructions on both
    murder counts in the same way. He gave separate instructions for each person
    charged on each count. He summarized the essential elements of first degree
    murder, then divided them up into three components that could be summarized as:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>participation</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>murder</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>classification of murder</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The trial judge converted each
    element into a question that he followed with legal instructions, evidentiary
    references, and the available findings, together with their verdict
    consequences.  He followed the format
    used in the <i>Ontario Specimen Jury
    Instructions (Criminal)</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[221]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not provide, nor was he asked to
    give, expanded instructions on the essential elements of unlawful act
    manslaughter.</p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[222]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cardoso and Glen argue that the trial judge did not
    adequately instruct the jury on the essential elements of unlawful act
    manslaughter, rather left it simply as a residual category of unproven
    murder.  For Cardoso, though not for
    Duong, the air of reality for this instruction emerged from the evidence of
    Glen who indicated that Cardoso didn’t know what was going to happen at the
    scene and Dang’s evidence about a plan to injure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[223]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is Cardoso’s further position that the trial judge
    failed to adequately relate the evidence to the offence of second degree
    murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[224]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the charge on both lesser
    offences was adequate in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[225]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Fairburn reminds that the jury convicted both
    appellants of first degree murder, thus finding that both participated in a
    planned and deliberate murder. To get there, the jurors plainly found an intention
    to kill. The failure to elaborate upon the fault element in manslaughter is of
    no moment.  And besides, the
    circumstances of the killings, involving gunshots and protracted beatings in an
    isolated place, negate any prospect of manslaughter as a viable verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[226]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Fairburn adds that Duong, whose liability was based
    on aiding, was the beneficiary of an extremely favourable jury instruction on
    second degree murder: the jury was told that to find Duong committed second
    degree murder, they had to find that he intended to kill or cause bodily harm
    that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or
    not. No such proof was required to establish Duong’s guilt as an <span
class=SpellE>aider</span>.</p>
  <h3>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[227]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A brief reference to the principles that govern
    instructions on lesser or included offences, as well as those that explain or
    define the essential elements of second degree murder and unlawful act
    manslaughter will be of service in the assessment of these grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[228]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, commission of one offence includes the
    commission of another or others. An allegation of first degree murder, for
    example, includes both second degree murder and manslaughter: <i>Criminal Code</i>, ss. 662(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a); 662(2); and 662(3).  But a trial judge does not always have an obligation to instruct a jury
    on every offence that is included in another as a matter of law: the obligation
    to instruct on included offences depends upon, among other factors, the
    evidence adduced, the issues raised and the positions of the parties. Where no
    reasonable view of the evidence could cause the jury to acquit of the principal
    offence charged, but convict of a lesser or included offence, a trial judge need
    not instruct the jury on the lesser offence: <i>R. v. Wong</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 520 (Ont. C.A.), at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 12.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[229]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The availability of an included offence, thus the
    obligation to instruct upon it often arises because some affirmative defence is
    advanced by an accused.  Where that
    defence has several essential elements, there must be evidence capable of
    sustaining each finding necessary to support the defence before an instruction
    about it will be required: <span class=SpellE><i>Cinous</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 53.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[230]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Murder is defined in s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and classified for
    sentencing purposes as either first degree murder or second degree murder in
    section 231. Any murder that is not first degree murder is second degree murder
    under s. 231(7).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[231]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fault or mental element in murder, thus second
    degree murder under s. 229(a)(ii), combines <i>intent</i> (to cause bodily harm), <i>knowledge</i> (that the bodily harm will <i>likely</i> cause death) and <i>recklessness</i> (whether death ensues).  Recklessness is
    almost an afterthought in this definition: <i>R.
    v. Cooper</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p. 154.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[232]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manslaughter is a residual category of culpable homicide,
    not defined by the <i>Criminal Code.</i> Manslaughter is an unlawful killing that is neither murder nor infanticide.
    Unlawful act manslaughter is involuntary manslaughter.<i> </i>The fault or mental element in unlawful act manslaughter comprises
    the mental or fault element for the underlying unlawful act, together with
    objective <span class=SpellE>forseeability</span> of the risk of bodily harm
    that is neither trivial nor transitory in the context of a dangerous act: <i>R. v. Creighton</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at
    pp. 44-45.</p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[233]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal comes up short.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[234]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his final instructions, the trial judge followed the
    step-direction approach of the <i>Ontario
    Specimen Jury Instructions (Criminal)</i>. As is well-known, those instructions
    list the essential elements of an offence, in this case first degree murder, <span
class=GramE>then</span> convert each element into a question for jurors to
    answer in accordance with the trial judge’s instructions about the governing
    legal principles, including any defence relating to the essential element under
    discussion. Adherents to the instructions then review the substantial features
    of the evidence that relate to that element, and leave the decision about the
    adequacy of the prosecutor’s proof of that essential element to the jury, along
    with an instruction about any verdict or further deliberation consequences that
    may follow from that decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[235]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the jurors were instructed that if they
    were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Duong and Cardoso, as
    individuals, unlawfully caused the death of the deceased, but were not
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that in doing so Cardoso or Duong (as the
    case may be) had a state of mind required to make the unlawful killing murder,
    they should find that person not guilty of first degree murder, but guilty of
    manslaughter. And so it was that manslaughter was left as a potential verdict
    for each of Cardoso and Duong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[236]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In connection with second degree murder, the jurors
    were instructed that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    either Cardoso or Duong committed murder, but not satisfied that the murder was
    both planned and deliberate on the part of Cardoso or Duong, they were to find
    that appellant not guilty of first degree murder, but guilty of second degree
    murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[237]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The availability of these verdicts was confirmed on the
    verdict sheets provided for the jury. The findings required for each verdict
    and appellant were replicated in the applicable decision trees. This is not a
    case in which verdicts of guilty of first degree murder and not guilty were the
    only verdicts left with the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[238]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The instructions on second degree murder and
    manslaughter are not free of error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[239]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his charge to the jury on the fault element
    described in s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the trial judge paraphrased the recklessness element
    as “was aware of the <i>risk </i>that she
    [he] could die from the injury, but went ahead anyway and took the chance”. The
    reference to “risk” is erroneous. The proper standard is “likelihood”.  This <span class=SpellE>misdescription</span> was not raised at trial, <span class=GramE>nor</span> on appeal.  It is not fatal here: <i>R. v. Moo</i> (2009), 247 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Ont. C.A.), at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 66-67.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[240]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did <i>not</i> provide the jurors with an instruction on manslaughter that coincided with the
    requirements of <i>Creighton </i>described
    in <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 232.  Nor was he asked to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[241]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the jurors were told that they should
    convict of manslaughter any accused who unlawfully caused the death of the
    deceased, or helped someone else unlawfully cause the death of the deceased,
    but who did not intend to kill, or cause the person bodily harm that the
    accused knew was likely to kill the person, and was reckless whether death
    ensued or not (as paraphrased above).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[242]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A more expansive direction would have made no
    difference. This is not and never was a manslaughter case.  Not for any principal.  And not for any secondary participant.  Out of his own mouth, Duong knew of the plan
    to kill Ton.  In a remote location.  In the dead of night.  Gunshots, followed by a savage beating.  Then flight.  Cardoso was a principal.  He
    “whacked” two people and tried to collect some money for it.  End of story.</p>
  <h4>THE INSTRUCTIONS ON FIRST DEGREE MURDER</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[243]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cardoso complains that the trial judge did not
    adequately relate the evidence to the essential elements of planned and
    deliberate first degree murder. He does not say that the verdicts of first
    degree murder are unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.  Once again, background is critical.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[244]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the prosecutor took the position that
    Cardoso, together with Glen, were the principals, the persons who actually
    killed both deceased. Further, the prosecutor contended, Cardoso was a willing and
    active participant in the planning of these murders.  He was promised consideration for his role
    and was arrested as he attempted to collect it from a person he erroneously
    thought had been dispatched by “Abe” to pay him on account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[245]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cardoso agreed that he had been part of an earlier plan
    to “kneecap” Ton, but the plan was never carried out.  He said he had no part in any subsequent plan
    to harm or kill Ton and did not participate in any plan that resulted in the
    deaths of both Ton and Bui.  In fact,
    according to Cardoso, he was not even in Ontario, much less at the scene of the
    shootings when they occurred.  He tried
    to explain several highly <span class=SpellE>inculpatory</span> pieces of
    evidence in the prosecutor’s case, including an alleged confession to an uncle
    in British Columbia, an admission to an undercover police officer recorded on
    audiotape, and the presence of his sweater and DNA in the front seat of the vehicle
    in which the deceased had been shot.</p>
  
  
  
  
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[246]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cardoso contends that the trial judge was required to
    ensure that his final instructions left the jury with a clear understanding
    about the essential elements of planned and deliberate first degree murder and
    the evidence that was relevant to their decision.  He submits that the trial judge erred in
    instructing the jury that they could rely on evidence of certain after-the-fact
    conduct in determining Cardoso’s liability for first degree murder, but failing
    to give proper limiting instructions about the use of that evidence.  Some of the evidence to which reference was
    made, such as telephone calls to <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> and flight to
    British Columbia, was irrelevant and, overall, the instructions lacked proper
    balance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[247]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Fairburn begins her response with the submission
    that the instructions on planned and deliberate first degree murder were at
    once accurate, balanced and complete.  Jurors were invited to consider <i>all </i>the evidence that established the planned and deliberate nature of the
    murder and the evidence that implicated the appellant Cardoso in it.  Admittedly, the trial judge did not provide
    an exhaustive catalogue of evidence that was relevant, material and admissible
    to demonstrate Cardoso’s complicity. That more items could have been included
    in the catalogue is not something of which Cardoso can complain. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[248]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Fairburn takes issue with Cardoso’s complaint about
    the inclusion of evidence of his after-the-fact conduct as relevant to his culpability
    for first degree murder. These items of circumstantial evidence should not have
    been subject to any limiting instructions as Cardoso contends.</p>
  <h3>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[249]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In every criminal jury trial, the jury is required to
    decide various factual issues.  It is the
    task of the trial judge to define those issues for the jury and to explain to
    them the legal principles that govern their decision on each issue.  Decisions on factual issues involve findings
    of fact.  And findings of fact are based
    on evidence adduced at trial. It is the further obligation of the trial judge
    to review for the jury the essential features of the evidence, and to relate it
    to the issues of fact they are required to decide, thus to ensure that the
    jurors understand the value and effect of the evidence:<i> R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 27; <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Azoulay</span></i>, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, at p. 498.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[250]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence adduced in a criminal trial may be relevant to
    proof of more than one issue the jury has to decide.  For example, evidence of motive may help to
    establish not only that the person with the motive committed the acts that
    constitute the basis of the offence charged, but also that she or he did so
    with the state of mind essential to make that conduct criminal.  Where items of evidence have this multiple
    relevance, a trial judge is under no obligation to recite, chapter and verse,
    the same evidence twice, where once will do, provided the instructions
    otherwise make it clear that the same evidence applies to the different issues: <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314,
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 14.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[251]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A prosecutor’s proof often consists of circumstantial
    evidence. Sometimes, that evidence consists of testimony about things an
    accused said or did after an offence has been committed.  At other times, the evidence may reveal
    things said or done before or around the same time as the offence was
    committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[252]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of events that happened after an offence was
    committed may provide a circumstantial link to the accused as the person
    responsible for a crime.  Possession of a
    murder weapon.  Possession or use of
    property taken from the victim.  Words
    spoken that reveal intimate details about the circumstances of the
    offence.  Evidence of the kind just illustrated
    is relevant because it tends to make a fact in issue, the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> participation in the offence charged, more likely than it would be without that
    evidence.  It is the relevance of the
    evidence that informs how the jury should be instructed about its use: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Peavoy</span> </i>(1997),
    117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 25.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[253]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of what occurred or what an accused said or
    did after an offence was committed does not have any unique or original nature
    or mythical quality about it.  Circumstantial evidence is what it is and what it remains.  A brick in the wall.  A link in the chain.  To be taken into account with and in the
    context of the rest of the evidence.  Weighed.  Evaluated.  The cumulative effect measured against the
    prosecutor’s burden of proof: <span class=SpellE><i>Peavoy</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[254]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, the prosecutor seeks to use evidence of
    things said or done by an accused <i>after</i> an offence has been committed to complete its proof through a different chain
    of reasoning. What is involved here is an inference from things said or done to
    a state of mind related to the commission of the offence.  Flight.  Change in appearance.  Fabrication
    of evidence.  It is only where the
    evidence is related to the crime charged that this evidence is of any relevance
    to the demonstration of guilt.  A
    specific instruction to the jury is required where the evidence is offered for
    this purpose: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Arcangioli</span></i>,
    [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, at p. 146; <i>R. v.
    White</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 26-27.</p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[255]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal fails.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[256]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complaints, as I apprehend the submissions, relate
    to the trial judge’s review of the evidence that tended to link Cardoso to the
    killings of the deceased and tended to show that he was a principal or a
    secondary participant in what were planned and deliberate first degree
    murders.  According to Cardoso, some of
    the evidence to which the trial judge referred was irrelevant to the issue, the
    references were, on the whole, incomplete, and the instructions on evidence of
    after-the-fact conduct did not properly circumscribe the use of that evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[257]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge’s general instructions on what
    constituted planned and deliberate first degree murder and the general nature
    of the evidence that could be relied upon <span class=GramE>–  prior</span>, contemporaneous and subsequent
    words and conduct –  were free of
    error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[258]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the items of evidence to which the trial judge
    directed the jury’s attention were <i>relevant</i> to the planned and deliberate character of the murders and Cardoso’s
    participation in them.  To be relevant on
    the issue of Cardoso’s participation in a planned and deliberate first degree
    murder, individual items of evidence need not prove <i>both</i> that the murder was planned and deliberate <i>and</i> that Cardoso was a principal or
    secondary participant in it.  An
    individual item of evidence may show that the murders were planned and
    deliberate.  Other items of evidence,
    individually or cumulatively, may establish Cardoso’s participation in the
    planning or his knowledge that the murder was planned and deliberate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[259]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To require an individual item of evidence to prove both
    the legal classification of the murder and Cardoso’s participation in it is, at
    once, to substitute proof for relevance and to impose a standard of
    conclusiveness that very few items of circumstantial evidence could meet:  <i>1 McCormick
    on Evidence </i>(6<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2006), §185, at p. 733; <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[260]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary references made by the trial judge were
    incomplete. Absent an obligation upon a trial judge to review <i>all </i>the evidence and relate it to the
    relevant issues, non-direction on items of evidence is neither surprising nor
    legally wrong. In many instances, the beneficiary of evidentiary omissions is
    the accused. So too here. Cardoso can scarcely complain that, among the
    omissions were references to Dang’s evidence about Cardoso’s participation in a
    scouting trip to find a location for the murders earlier in the day of the
    killings, and her evidence of providing the gun to <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> in the presence of Glen and Cardoso hours before the killings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[261]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the evidence of <span class=SpellE>Casamiro</span> Dias and Det. Sgt. Campbell disclosed things that Cardoso said and did after
    the killings had taken place. Dias’ evidence consisted of admissions he
    attributed to Cardoso that, on their own, linked him to a planned and
    deliberate killing, for which he <span class=GramE>was to be</span> paid
    $10,000.  The details provided were
    eerily similar to the events that took place when Ton and Bui were killed. This
    evidence was relevant, material and admissible to prove the planned and
    deliberate nature of the murders and Cardoso’s participation in them. It was in
    no way dependent on antecedent proof of the arrangement to pay money for the
    killings.  The same may be said about the
    evidence of Det. Sgt. Campbell and the recordings of his interaction with
    Cardoso on collection day. No limiting instructions of the nature suggested
    were required.  </p>

lang=EN-US>In his closing address to the jury,

    twofold motive to become involved in the murders of the deceased.  He wanted to impress Duong’s associates in
    San Jose (who had provided the murder weapon) to further his connection with
    them by providing the killers Duong sought. And <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> had a financial motive as well: he would share in the monies paid to Cardoso

    and returned to or continued his involvement in drug trafficking. The jurors
    were told that evidence that <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> did not flee after

lang=EN-US>For <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span>,
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rondinelli</span> characterizes the evidence of <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> trafficking activities after the killings as
    evidence of after-the-fact conduct that had no evidentiary value on any
    material issue at trial.  The jurors, he
    submits, should have been told that the evidence could not amount to evidence
    of motive and was of no value in their deliberations.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rondinelli</span> acknowledges the admittedly false story about the car breakdown.  But, he says, this evidence, again of
    after-the-fact conduct, could say nothing about the level of <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> culpability, thus should not have been left to the
    jury as an item of evidence relevant to <span class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> participation
    in a planned and deliberate murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[271]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Ms. Fairburn submits that <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> complaints amount to naught.  The evidence adduced at trial demonstrated
    clearly that <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> persisted in his drug dealing ways
    after Ton and Bui had been killed.  His
    involvement in these activities was evidence of motive that tended to link him
    to the killings.  The jury were properly
    instructed on the relevance of evidence of motive and adequately warned about
    the lack of probative value associated with the evidence that <span
class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> did not flee the jurisdiction or otherwise drop from
    view after the killings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[272]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The false story about the car

    of after-the-fact conduct. <span class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> call to Ms. Ward
    took place <i>before</i>, not after the
    deceased were killed.  This
    pre-fabricated deceit was a relevant item of evidence in a determination of <span

  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h3>

lang=EN-US>[273]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Evidence of motive is circumstantial
    evidence.  The argument for the relevance
    of motive in a criminal case is that evidence that a person had a motive to do
    an act enhances the likelihood that the person did that act. Motive points
    forward to future conduct. The argument involves <span class=SpellE>prospectant</span> use of circumstantial evidence.  We infer
    from prior motive subsequent conduct.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[274]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Evidence of motive is relevant to
    prove an <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> participation in an offence, as
    well as the state of mind with which he or she acted.  In other words, motive is relevant in proof
    of identity and intention: <i>R. v. Lewis</i>,
    [1979] 2 S.C.R. 821, at p. 834; <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Cloutier</span></i>, [1940] S.C.R. 131, at p. 135. Motive is

lang=EN-US>Evidence of motive is not excluded
    simply because it reveals extrinsic misconduct, provided its probative value on
    the issue of motive outweighs its prejudicial effect through propensity

lang=EN-US>The motive that may impel a person
    to do some act that amounts to a crime is as variable as the range of human

lang=EN-US>The prosecution may also rely on
    evidence of what an accused said or did <i>after </i>an offence has been committed as circumstantial evidence supportive of
    guilt.  Sometimes, this evidence may
    include evidence that an accused, after a crime, offered an alibi for the time
    when the crime was committed.  And
    sometimes, the prosecution contends that the alibi was concocted or fabricated later
    for the purpose of avoiding liability for the offence committed earlier.</span></p>

    fabricated alibi can constitute circumstantial evidence from which an inference

    to adequately instruct the jury about the prohibited and permitted uses of
    evidence of <span class=SpellE>Yumnu’s</span> bad character.  The general instructions provided were
    inadequate.  Specific instructions were
    necessary, especially in connection with the evidence of Cardoso and Glen. The

    the general instruction about the limited use of evidence of bad
    character.  The later references to “any

    As the trial proceeded, the trial judge gave jurors proper limiting
    instructions about the use they could not make of evidence of bad character,

    omission of Cardoso’s name from the list of accused at the outset of the instruction
    on evidence of bad character. That said, she continues, this inadvertent
    omission was rescued by the contents of the instructions that followed and the
    references to “any” and to “all” accused.  The specific instructions about the evidentiary value of Cardoso’s
    criminal record, Ward’s evidence about <span class=SpellE>Yumnu</span> and the

lang=EN-US>Evidence of extrinsic misconduct or

    character, one who has a disposition or propensity to commit crime, has an
    inherent prejudicial effect. Untutored about the limits on their use of this
    evidence, jurors may reason from evidence of bad character to proof of guilt of
    the offence charged. Such a path of reasoning, which uses evidence of bad
    character as circumstantial evidence of guilt, the law prohibits. We insist
    that convictions be grounded on proof of conduct not of character.  Confronted with evidence of bad character,
    jurors may be inclined to punish an accused for prior misdeeds by finding guilt
    on the charge being tried, without a discerning evaluation of the adequacy of
    the prosecutor’s proof.  The jurors’
    attention may also be diverted from the task at hand, an analysis of the
    cogency of the prosecutor’s proof on the charge being tried, because of the
    confusion produced by the introduction of other crimes evidence: <i>R. v. D. (L.E.)</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111, at

lang=EN-US>Especially in a joint trial, where
    some but not all accused have provided statements to investigators that are
    introduced in evidence, a trial judge must ensure that jurors understand the
    use they may make of the statement as evidence.  In most instances, as here, the statements are evidence to be considered
    only in determining whether the offence alleged to have been committed by their
    maker has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  A piece of evidence, to be taken into account
    along with and in the same way as the rest of the evidence.  To be believed in whole, in part, or not at
    all.  </span></p>

    limited use must be explained to the jury, especially statements that refer to
    things done or said by others who are being tried together with the maker of
    the statement. The mere fact that a statement is the subject of specific instruction
    does not, expressly or by necessary implication, invite an item by item
    appraisal of the evidence inconsistent with <i>Morin</i> or constitute what has become known as a <i>Miller</i> error: <i>R. v. Miller</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C.

    conspiracy and described the position of each appellant in response to the

lang=EN-US>The trial judge instructed the jury

    accused the jurors were considering. The second, actual <span class=GramE>membership,</span> could be established by adding the acts and declarations of other likely
    co-conspirators in furtherance of the common purpose to the words and conduct
    of the individual accused under consideration to determine whether the

lang=EN-US>Cardoso and Yumnu acknowledge that
    the trial judge accurately set out the essential elements of the conspiracies
    alleged and properly converted them to questions for the jurors to
    consider.  But the trial judge, they say,
    conflated the third stage of <span class=GramE>the  conspiracy</span> analysis, membership, with the
    first, agreement. The trial judge referred to evidence to prove the agreement
    that was irrelevant to that issue and relevant only to the question of
    membership. The evidentiary references were generally mangled and not all the acts
    and declarations the judge used to illustrate how the prosecutor’s proof of
    membership could be completed were in furtherance of the common unlawful
    purpose. </span></p>

    references to the evidence. But any errors favoured the position of the
    appellants, imposed a more onerous burden on the prosecution, and had no effect

    instruction would have done nothing less than seal the fate of the appellants
    on both conspiracy counts.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[336]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The nature of the appellants’

    unnecessary.  A few basic reminders will
    suffice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[337]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It is fundamental that to establish
    the guilt of an accused of conspiracy to commit a specific offence, the
    prosecutor must prove not only the unlawful agreement alleged, but equally the
    accused’s participation or membership in it: <i>R. v. Carter</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, at p. 946.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[338]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The first step in conspiracy
    prosecutions involves proof of the existence of the conspiracy alleged. A
    determination of the adequacy of the prosecutor’s proof on this issue is to be
    made on <i>all</i> the evidence, including
    but not only what alleged conspirators have said and done in furtherance of the
    common purpose: <i>R. v. Paradis</i>, [1934]
    S.C.R. 165, at p. 168.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[339]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The agreement may be established in
    a variety of ways, including by inference from the manner in which the
    substantive offence, the object of the conspiracy, was committed.  A reasonable doubt about the fact or object
    of the agreement ends the jury’s deliberations without consideration of the
    membership issue in relation to any accused.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[340]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Proof of an individual’s membership
    in a conspiracy involves two steps. The first step, <i>probable</i> membership, is determined on the basis of the individual’s
    own words and conduct. Put in another way, proof of an individual’s probable
    membership in a conspiracy must be made exclusively on the basis of evidence
    directly admissible against that person: <i>Carter </i>at p. 947.  The second step, <i>actual</i> membership, permits recourse to
    acts and declarations of other conspirators in furtherance of a common design.
    The purpose of this additional evidence is to convert direct proof of probable
    participation into completed proof of actual participation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[341]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It is not every act or word of
    fellow co-conspirators that may be summoned to complete the prosecutor’s proof
    of an individual accused’s membership in the conspiracy. The act or declaration
    must be made while the conspiracy (or common venture) is ongoing and be in
    furtherance of the common design: <i>Carter</i> at p. 947; <i>R. v. Mapara</i>, [2005] 1
    S.C.R. 358, at para. 8. Sometimes, acts or declarations that occur <i>after</i> the offence object of the
    agreement has been committed may be “in furtherance” of a common design: <i>R. v. Sauvé </i>(2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 321
    (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 115-118.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We should also keep in mind that
    when an alleged co-conspirator testifies and describes acts and declarations of
    others alleged to be involved in the conspiracy, the co-conspirator exception
    to the hearsay rule is not engaged. Rather, the evidence is directly admissible
    against the person whose acts or declarations the co-conspirator describes in
    his or her testimony: <i>Canada (Attorney
    General) v. LaForme</i>, [2010] ONCA 532, at para. 1; <i>R. v. Connelly </i>(2001), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 292 (Nfld. C.A.), at para.

lang=EN-US>[343]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge correctly instructed
    the jury about the essential elements of each conspiracy charged. His legal
    instructions about what I have termed the agreement component of the offence
    were legally correct. Regrettably, he limited some of the examples he provided
    of evidence that could be used to help prove the agreement to what the specific
    accused under consideration said or did.  The examples given did not detract from the overall instruction to
    consider the whole of the evidence, nor prejudice either appellant who
    complains now. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[344]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Reduced to its essence, the
    appellants’ complaint is grounded in a clinical analysis of the probative
    potential of individual items of evidence stripped of their context. Frequently
    individual items of evidence have <span class=GramE>multiple relevance</span>.
    In cases like this, an item of evidence may help to establish both an agreement
    and an accused’s participation in it. What is more, it is at least arguable, as
    Ms. Magotiaux for the respondent points out, that the trial judge’s
    instructions left the impression that an appellant had to be “instrumental” in
    the functioning of the conspiracy, thus imposing an additional requirement of
    proof beyond what the governing principles demand.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[345]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, this is a case in which an
    admitted co-conspirator and participant in the killings testified for the
    prosecution.  Dang gave evidence of
    things done and said by each of the appellants. The prosecution did not need to
    invoke any hearsay exception to permit jury use of this evidence.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    deceased were nothing less than executions. The victims were lured to a dark,
    deserted road. Ambushed. Shot. Beaten. Left for dead. Getaway vehicles

    for the marking of the verdict sheet for these appellants on the conspiracy
    counts.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[348]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The final instructions on conspiracy
    were flawed.  Incomplete for failure to
    review the relevant evidence and relate it to the issues. Confusing, for
    misplacing items of evidence on issues to which they did not relate.  But of no moment in the final analysis and in
    light of the correct instructions on the essential elements of the offence and
    the overwhelming nature of the prosecution’s case.</span></p>

    later on November 2, 2005.  Five accused
    stood trial on an indictment that contained five counts, including substantive
    offences, preliminary crimes and a single allegation of assistance after the

    resisted inclusion of the evidentiary references.  At first, the trial judge agreed with the

lang=EN-US>The objections of Cardoso and Duong
    have three aspects. The <i>entire</i> charge
    should not have been left to the jury because doing so simply compounded the
    effect of the several erroneous instructions on the deliberation process.  Two specific errors added to the unfairness
    of the trial.  The first involved
    instructions that could be viewed, especially when reduced to writing, as
    detracting from the principles of <i>R. v.
    W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  The
    second contradicted the principles in <i>Morin</i> that the burden of proof applies to the essential elements of the offence, not
    to individual items of evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[355]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The respondent counters the
    appellants’ submissions on each issue.  Ms. Fairburn submits that the trial judge had a well-grounded discretion
    to provide a written copy of the entire final instructions to the jury for
    their use during deliberations.  He
    exercised that discretion properly in this joint trial of multiple counts and accused
    that extended over several months and involved cutthroat <span class=SpellE>defences</span>.
    Although prior decisions of this court note that written instructions are more
    likely to be relied upon than those given orally, what is critical is the
    nature and extent of any errors, not the form in which they are expressed.  Nothing erroneous here is rendered fatally so
    by its reduction to writing.</span></p>

    … the choice of instructions to the jury”) and in s. 682(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    (“a copy or transcript of any charge to the jury …”).  In the result, the <i>Criminal Code</i> neither requires, permits, nor prohibits final

    57 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at para. 47; <i>R.

    judges omit from the written versions of their oral instructions evidentiary
    references and statements of the positions of counsel, on the ground that
    factual decisions are for the jury who are not bound by the trial judge’s
    summary, and that jurors are equally not bound by positions of counsel. Rather,
    the jury is required to decide only whether the essential elements of an offence

    materials included in final instructions should not be provided to jurors.  This court embraced the use of written

    submission made in <i>Poitras</i> on its
    head, alleging error in what was argued there to be essential.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The <i>Poitras</i> court rejected the all or nothing argument advanced there.
    The written version need not be an exact replica of the oral rendition, but what
    is provided, for example the governing legal principles, must contain <i>all</i> the instructions on those
    principles, including instructions on the presumption of innocence and the
    burden and standard of proof: <i>Poitras</i> at para. 59.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The <i>Poitras</i> court considered that provision of a written copy of all
    the instructions to the jury for their reference during deliberations could
    bury a critical part of those instructions in a maelstrom of detail of which
    the jury would have no need during deliberations: <i>Poitras </i>at para. 59. A similar observation was made in <i>Henry</i> about protracted evidentiary
    references: <i>Henry </i>at para. 58.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Each case is different.  In this case, I am not persuaded that
    provision of the entire charge to the jury in written form, together with the
    deliberation aids of decision trees and verdict sheets, reflects legal error or
    an abuse of judicial discretion, or created any unfairness in the adjudicative
    process that led to verdict.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>A judge who proposes to provide
    jurors with a written version of final instructions for their use during
    deliberations should always vet those instructions with counsel sufficiently in
    advance of delivery to permit meaningful discussions and any necessary
    corrections. The procedure followed in <i>Poitras</i> should be used as a guide. The trial judge followed that approach here.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In appropriate cases, no principled
    reason prohibits a trial judge from providing a written version of his or
    entire charge for jurors’ use during deliberations.  In deciding whether to follow this approach,
    a trial judge might consider factors such as these:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>i.          the
    length of the trial proceedings, including the period between the conclusion of the evidence and the charge;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ii.         the
    volume of evidentiary references contained in the charge, bearing in mind the principles governing
    evidentiary review;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iii.       the
    danger of diluting the effect of the instructions on the governing legal principles by their submersion in a
    protracted evidentiary review;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iv.        the
    positions of counsel;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>v.         the
    issues to be resolved by the jury in their deliberations; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>vi.        the
    danger of simply overburdening the jurors by the volume of the instructions;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>vii.       whether
    jurors took notes of the evidence adduced at trial;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>viii.      the risk that jurors will consider the evidentiary references
    to be exhaustive of the evidence
    they should consider in reaching their decision;
    and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ix.        <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[368]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Where written versions of final
    instructions provided to the jury include evidentiary references, a trial judge
    should emphasize the obligation of the jurors to consider <i>all</i> the evidence, not just that to which reference is made in the
    instructions.  The judge should remind
    jurors of the supremacy of their recollection of the evidence, of its
    importance to their decision and of the irrelevance of any views the judge may
    have or seem to have about factual issues.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[369]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Critical to any assistance that
    written versions of final instructions may provide to jurors is the jurors’
    ability to read and understand the language of trial.  In this case, the questionnaire provided to
    each perspective juror asked about and required a reply to a question about language
    facility. There is no suggestion that any juror selected could not read or
    understand the language of the final instructions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[370]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In this case, as I have said,
    provision of a written version of final instructions to the jurors was neither
    wrong, nor unfair. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[371]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The specific complaints advanced in
    conjunction with this ground also fail. A general instruction that evidence of
    a single witness, if believed, is sufficient to prove an issue of fact is at
    once correct and does not detract from a <span class=SpellE><i>Vetrovec</i></span> warning in connection
    with the testimony of a specific witness.  It also ensures, often to the benefit of an accused, that findings of
    fact are based on the quality of testimony, not on the quantity of witnesses
    who give it. Based upon who is believed, not on how many are called. The
    instruction on <i>W. (D.) </i>was adequate
    in the circumstances of this case.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>A Postscript</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[372]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Specimen jury instructions provide
    the basic building blocks for a jury charge.  They are not the one-size-fits-all of jury instructions. Their
    application is reasoned, not rote. Tailoring may be required. A trim here. An
    addition there. According to the circumstances of the case.  The inclusion of irrelevant instructions
    blurs the focus of the trial.  In some
    cases, the clutter of irrelevancies may cause a miscarriage of justice. After
    anxious consideration, I am satisfied that it did not do so here.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[373]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The manner in which trial judges
    instruct juries, how they organize their final instructions, is left largely to
    their discretion.  Reasonable people may
    differ about how best to educate jurors to make an informed decision.  Substance controls, not form.  But sometimes the manner chosen to convey the
    essential matter may obfuscate rather than enlighten. That nearly happened
    here. The chief mischief makers: prolixity, rote repetition, uneven evidentiary
    references and flawed organization. Perfection in final instructions is neither
    required nor attainable, but organized, focused, clearly expressed
    instructions, tailored to the circumstances of the case are at once the
    entitlement of the jurors and the obligation of the trial judge.  </span></p>
