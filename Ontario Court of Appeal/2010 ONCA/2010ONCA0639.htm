  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant <span class=SpellE>Shahmahmood</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ahmadi</span> appeals his conviction for sexual assault by
    Pelletier J. of the Superior Court of Justice on September 8, 2008. He also
    appeals the one year custodial sentence he received on April 28, 2009; he seeks
    either a conditional sentence or a shorter term of imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s conviction arose from an alleged sexual
    assault on a seriously intoxicated 16-year old girl in the apartment of one of
    the appellant’s friends in Ottawa.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his conviction appeal, the appellant makes four
    submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant contends that the trial judge
    erred in failing to consider the effect of the contradictory evidence with
    respect to anal penetration on the complainant’s reliability as a whole. The
    complainant testified that one of the components of the appellant’s assault on
    her was anal penetration. The medical evidence from the complainant’s visit to
    a hospital a day after the alleged assault did not confirm that this took
    place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. The trial judge did
    scrutinize this aspect of the complainant’s testimony on two separate occasions.
    First, in his review of the evidence and, before he made his assessment of the
    complainant’s overall credibility, the trial judge specifically referred to the
    fact that her account of anal penetration was contradicted by the medical
    evidence. We are therefore not persuaded that he failed to take that
    contradiction into account when assessing her credibility as a whole. When he
    turned to the contradiction the second time to consider whether the Crown had
    proved sexual assault causing bodily harm, he did not reject the complainant’s
    evidence, but rather declined to find the element of bodily harm had been
    proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This careful scrutiny did not preclude the
    trial judge from finding that other aspects of the sexual assault, especially
    those confirmed by corroborative evidence, did occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant contends that the trial judge
    erred with respect to corroborating or confirmatory evidence. The trial judge
    initially decided that the complainant’s evidence could only be relied on where
    corroborated, given her level of intoxication. The appellant submits that he
    erred by relying on certain evidence as being confirmatory of the sexual
    assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. Some of the evidence criticized by the
    appellant in this submission was indeed directly corroborative of the sexual
    assault – for example, the injuries the complainant suffered after she left the
    Tim Horton’s store with the appellant and his friend. The other evidence,
    although not directly corroborative of the sexual assault, was confirmatory of
    the complainant’s account of the events generally, and was used as such by the
    trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    by misapprehending the evidence about the appellant’s failure to respond to the
    calls made by Ms. Redmond, who was concerned that the young complainant was
    late returning to the Tim Horton’s store.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. In our view, the
    trial judge properly understood the telephone communications – and lack thereof
    – between the appellant and Ms. Redmond in the early morning hours of the night
    in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the appellant asserts that the trial judge
    erred in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant on the basis that
    the appellant’s friend who, according to the complainant’s testimony, stood in
    the bathroom and watched the sexual assault, did not testify at the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. The trial judge’s observation in this
    domain was a straightforward common sense observation – if the complainant
    wanted to concoct a story about a violent sexual assault, it would be unlikely
    that she would insert into the story a close friend of the appellant who might
    well be able to contradict her story in whole or in part if it were concocted.
    The trial judge was entitled to regard this point as one telling in favour of
    the complainant’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the sentence appeal, we can see no basis for
    interfering with the one year custodial portion of the sentence. The sexual
    assault was made on a young girl in a vulnerable position. A custodial sentence
    was entirely appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
