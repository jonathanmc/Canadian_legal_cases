  <h4><span lang=EN-US>By The Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant appeals the decision of the trial judge to deprive him of all costs
    of the action. The appellant was a defendant in respect of numerous claims for
    fraud and other malfeasance in respect of 19 properties that were sold to other
    defendants by the ORC, the appellant’s employer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Two days
    prior to trial, the respondent withdrew or abandoned its claims in respect of
    15 of the impugned transactions. Then at the opening of trial, all claims
    alleging bid-rigging were abandoned or withdrawn. Finally, during its closing
    argument, the respondent withdrew all remaining claims against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant then sought its costs of the action against the respondent on two
    bases: (1) that all claims were withdrawn against him, and (2) that he had made
    two early offers to settle, the first offering to consent to dismissal of the
    action without costs, and the second, made during his lengthy examination for
    discovery, was to pay $20,000 Neither offer was accepted. As a result, the
    appellant remained a party to the action for almost 9 years and through
    counsel, defended himself at a trial lasting 18 days over three months in the
    fall of 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The trial
    judge declined to award any costs to the appellant. He found that although the
    appellant was not dishonest or purposely evasive as a witness, his involvement
    in two of the transactions was “troubling” and negligent and had the claim not
    been abandoned by the Crown, the result might have been much different; and in
    a third transaction, the Aurora, (for which he was not sued) the appellant
    agreed to the two unjustified price reductions. The trial judge concluded that
    these involvements justified the denial of any award of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant submits that the trial judge made errors in principle which undermine
    the exercise of his discretion on this issue. We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    respondents’ withdrawal of their claims against the appellant before the end of
    the trial amounted to an effective admission by the Crown that it could not
    succeed against the appellant and that its claims against him must be
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Normally,
    there are costs consequences to a party where its action is dismissed. The
    purpose of the spectre of cost consequences is to focus litigants on the costs
    of the litigation to all parties, and to ensure that litigants act responsibly
    in bringing and pursuing actions, which are costly for any party involved.
    Similarly, the Rules regarding the cost consequences of offers to settle have
    the same purpose: to focus litigants on the need to settle as early as
    possible, if possible, with cost consequences for failure to accept a
    reasonable offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In this
    case, the trial judge erred by failing to view the appellant as <i>prima facie</i> entitled to his costs of the
    action, given that the action was wholly withdrawn against him before the end
    of trial and ultimately dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The trial
    judge also erred by failing to advert to the offers to settle that the
    appellant made to try to extricate <span class=GramE>himself</span> from the
    litigation. As he was not one of the parties who benefitted financially by
    purchasing government properties at undervalue, the amount of damages that
    could be recovered against him should have been a factor for the respondent to
    consider in assessing any offer from him. The fact that the respondent rejected
    the offer of $20,000 and continued against the appellant right up until the end
    of the trial, indicates that it should have been prepared to accept the cost
    consequences for that strategy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in our view, although the trial judge was entitled
    to include as a factor the conduct of the appellant on the impugned
    transactions, the nature of that misconduct, as found by the trial judge, did
    not trump the other principles that had to be considered so as to warrant a
    complete denial of costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the decision of the trial judge should be
    set aside and an order made awarding costs of the action to the appellant on
    the partial indemnity scale, but with a significant reduction to reflect the
    misconduct identified by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of $256,000 were claimed on the partial indemnity
    scale, including $210,000 for fees. We would reduce the fee portion of the
    costs to reflect some duplication of time caused by a change of lawyers as well
    as an additional amount for the misconduct. In the result, the fees are reduced
    to $140,000, and the total amount awarded including disbursements and taxes is
    $186,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of the application for leave to appeal costs and
    for the appeal to the appellant fixed at $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and
    taxes.</p>
