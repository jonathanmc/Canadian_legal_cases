    Angelo Gabriele (“Gabriele”), a number of Gabriele controlled corporations,
    certain of his business partners, and several former employees of ORC.  The claims were far-reaching, involving
    allegations of fraud, conspiracy, bribery, breach of fiduciary duty and bid
    rigging in over 40 transactions involving ORC and one or more of the
    defendants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>ORC alleged that Gabriele, primarily through compromising the
    loyalty of various ORC employees, dishonestly acquired several properties from
    ORC.  ORC further alleged that he
    dishonestly obtained abatements in the purchase prices of some of those
    properties.  In addition, ORC contended
    that Gabriele had used various dishonest means to obtain contracts with ORC
    involving the environmental clean-up on some of ORC’s properties.  ORC maintained that while Gabriele (or
    associated companies) had billed and been paid for work described in the
    contracts<span class=GramE>,  the</span> work
    had not been done.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The lengthy trial eventually focused on seven
    transactions.  The trial judge found no
    liability on two of the transactions.  On
    a third transaction (the “Aurora transaction”), the trial judge allowed a
    counterclaim and awarded damages to one of Gabriele’s corporations in the
    amount of $50,000.  The ORC was
    successful on the remaining four transactions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    appellant on both appeals. The other appellants are entities controlled by

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FIRST APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first appeal (C50050) involves the “Markham/Pickering”
    transaction and the “Aurora” transaction.  On the Markham/Pickering transaction, the appellants challenge the trial
    judge’s finding that the appellants did not perform the work for which they
    were paid by ORC.  On the Aurora
    transaction, the appellants contend that the trial judge erred in failing to
    order a reference to determine the quantum of damages suffered by the
    appellants as a result of ORC’s failure to close the sale of the property to
    one of the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The court did not require argument from the respondents on
    either submission and both can be addressed briefly.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that the environmental clean-up work
    for which the Gabriele-related companies had been paid was not done.  The argument made on appeal is that the trial
    judge improperly reversed the onus of proof on that issue and required the
    appellants to prove that the work was done.  The appellants argue that had the trial judge applied the proper onus to
    the totality of the evidence, he would not have concluded that ORC had
    established that the contracted work was not performed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We see no reversal of the onus of proof in the trial judge’s
    reasons.  The trial judge fully canvassed
    the relevant evidence and made clear findings of fact.  There was abundant evidence to support ORC’s
    contention that the work was not done.  The mere fact that the trial judge did not draw inferences favourable to
    the appellants that may have been available from some part of the evidence does
    not suggest any reversal of the burden of proof.  There is no basis upon which this court can
    or should interfere with the trial judge’s findings.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In respect of the Aurora transaction, the trial judge found
    that ORC was required to close the transaction with the Gabriele <span
class=GramE>corporation</span>.  He
    found, however, that the corporation had not proved any damages beyond its
    $50,000 deposit.  The trial judge
    carefully considered whether the Gabriele <span class=GramE>corporation</span> had demonstrated any loss of potential profits through the potential
    development of the property.  The trial
    judge concluded that the appellants had not demonstrated that the property
    could not have been developed and sold at a profit.  Once again, his analysis of the evidence is
    careful and detailed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The appellants contend that even if the evidence did not admit of a
    precise quantification of the potential lost profits, the trial judge was
    required to either do his best in quantifying that loss or alternatively direct
    a reference.  This submission misses the
    crucial distinction between a finding that there was some loss of profit,
    albeit one that could not be easily determined, and the finding actually made –
    that the appellants had failed to prove any lost profit.  On that finding, there was nothing to
    quantify and no reason to direct a reference.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE SECOND APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second appeal (C50052) involves three transactions,
    referred to as “Britannia Tomken”, “Bowmanville” and “Kings Highway 2A”, and
    the trial judge’s award of compound interest.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Britannia Tomken</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the Britannia Tomken transaction, the
    appellants submit that the trial judge made two errors: (1) in finding that the
    appellants had been unjustly enriched as a result of a price abatement of
    $300,000.00 agreed to by the ORC prior to closing; and (2) in ordering the
    appellants to disgorge a profit they made on the resale of the property less
    than one year later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    trial judge found that the appellants had conspired with John Falcioni, an ORC
    employee and fiduciary, and the marketing coordinator for the sale of the
    property. As part of that conspiracy, Falcioni breached his fiduciary duty owed
    to ORC.  The trial judge also found that,
    as a consequence of that agreement, the appellants obtained the property despite
    having made a bid that did not comply with the request for proposals and <span
class=GramE>obtained a $</span>300,000 unjustified abatement to the purchase
    price.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argued that the ORC lost nothing because
    the appellants had tendered the highest bid, that amendments made to the bid by
    the appellants were contemplated by the bid terms and that the abatement was
    negotiated with the ORC. These submissions ignore the trial judge’s finding of
    the unlawful conspiracy set out above.  The trial judge’s findings in respect of the unlawful conspiracy are
    fully supported by the evidence accepted by the trial judge.  Further, the trial judge made very strong
    credibility findings against Gabriele and Falcioni, findings which the
    appellants acknowledge are subject to deference by this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also submit that the trial judge was not
    entitled to impose as a remedy the disgorgement of profits on the resale of the
    Britannia Tomken property, based on the principles set out in <i>Soulos v. Korkontzilas</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R.
    217, on which the trial judge relied.  First, the appellants argue that <i>Soulos</i> does not apply where the plaintiff has suffered no damages.  We disagree.  <i>Soulos</i> has application even
    where there has been no loss. (see para. 42 of <i>Soulos</i>)  In any event, as
    found by the trial judge, the ORC did suffer a loss as a result of the
    conspiracy.  The loss was the $300,000
    improper abatement to the purchase price and the improper award of the contact
    to the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also submit that <i>Soulos </i>cannot apply to the appellants as the appellants were not
    fiduciaries.  This submission
    misconstrues the effect of <i>Soulos</i>.  As the appellants were co-conspirators with
    the fiduciary and <span class=GramE>were knowing</span> recipients of the
    wrongful benefit, the principles in <i>Soulos </i>apply equally to them.  (see <i>Ontario Wheat Producers’ Marketing Board v.
    Royal Bank of Canada</i> (1984), 9 D.L.R. 4th 729 (Ont.&nbsp;C.A.) and <i>MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. V. Binstead</i> (1983), 14 E.T.R. 269 (B.C.S.C.), both cited with approval by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>Soulos</i> at paras. 41 and
    42)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants further submit that the trial judge
    erred in treating the resale of the property as a “flip” of the property for a
    higher price when the evidence was that the appellants had added value to the
    property before its resale. We do not agree. The appellants were effectively
    constructive trustees of the property for the ORC and were not entitled to
    profit from it. As the trial judge allowed the appellants to have a reference
    to establish any expenses they may have incurred, they will not be penalized
    for their expenditures on the property. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants argued that the trial judge erred in finding that two abatements to
    the price they paid for the purchase of the Bowmanville property unjustly
    enriched the appellants. The appellants state that there was no unjust
    enrichment because the reductions were negotiated between the parties and the
    negotiated agreements constituted a juristic reason for the reductions.  One reduction was made before closing and the
    second was made well after closing.</span></p>

    disagree.  The trial judge did not find
    that the abatements were the product of <i>bona

    through the compromised loyalties of ORC employees. Agreements achieved through
    that compromised loyalty could not amount to a juristic reason for the
    enrichment of the appellant purchaser. The trial judge referred to several
    aspects of the evidence in support of his finding in respect of the true nature
    of the abatements. These included: </span></p>

    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in ordering them to disgorge the
    profits they made on the development and resale of the Kings Highway 2A
    property. The trial judge granted this relief as well as a reference to
    calculate their profit on the development. He did <span class=GramE>so on</span> the basis that the appellants’ purchase of the property from the ORC was
    tainted by two alleged wrongdoings in connection with the appellants’ bid for the
    property. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    first was that the appellants received confidential evaluation information from
    the ORC shortly before making their bids.  Second, by submitting two bids in different names, the appellants deceitfully
    created the false appearance of a competitive market.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    respect of the first finding, the trial judge could make no determination as to
    how the information came into the appellant’s possession.  Although he inferred that it was done in a
    wrongful manner by someone at the ORC, there was no evidence that it was and no
    evidence that the appellants, as opposed to all other perspective bidders, were
    the only ones to receive it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    respect to the second finding of wrongdoing, although the trial judge concluded
    that the manner in which the two bids were made was deceitful, he also found
    that the ORC did not suffer any loss on the transaction.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    our view, the trial judge erred in awarding the remedy of disgorgement of
    profits on this property.  There was no
    proven breach of fiduciary duty by any ORC employee or conspiracy involving ORC
    employees and the appellants.  In these
    circumstances, the principles in <i>Soulos</i> do not apply.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    as there were no damages suffered by the ORC, there was no fraud proven against
    the appellants, acting on their own, in the submission of the two bids.  Therefore, the remedy of disgorgement could
    not be imposed in the circumstances of this transaction.</span></p>

    interest in the circumstances of this case. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CROSS APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondents appeal the decision of the trial judge to dismiss the claims
    against Messrs. Falcioni and Perdue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to Mr. Falcioni, the Crown claimed damages for the loss suffered as a
    result of the improper abatement of $300,000 in the purchase price of the
    Britannia Tomken Road property.  There
    was no claim for unjust enrichment made against him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    our view, this part of the cross-appeal must be allowed.  The trial judge found that he was a
    co-conspirator with Mr. Gabriele to injure the ORC as described earlier.  Having made those findings, the trial judge
    gave no reasons for dismissing the claim against Mr. Falcioni.  Those findings compel a finding of liability
    against Mr. Falcioni in respect of the $300,000 abatement in the purchase
    price.  As a result, we would vary the
    judgment to provide that Mr. Falcioni be jointly and severally liable with the
    defendants named in paragraphs 3 to 6 of the trial judgment in respect of the
    amount of $300,000.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    to Mr. Perdue, it was alleged that he was a party to the improper abatement of
    the purchase price for the Bowmanville property.  The trial judge found that he was in a
    conflict of interest but did not find that he was in breach of any fiduciary
    duty or a party to any conspiracy.  In
    these circumstances, the trial judge made no error in dismissing the claim
    against Mr. Perdue.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>COSTS</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    results of the appeals are mixed.  For
    the purposes of costs, in our view, the two main appeals can probably be
    treated as one.  Given the mixed success,
    it would seem to us that an order of no costs would be appropriate.  With respect to the cross-appeal which
    occupied a small portion of the appeal, it would seem to us that, if asked,
    modest costs would follow the event.</span></p>

    the parties are unable to agree on costs and if any party to the main appeal or
    cross-appeal seeks costs, they are to provide written submissions not exceeding
    3 pages within 14 days of this decision.  Any reply to be filed within 7 days thereafter and not to exceed 2 pages</span></p>
