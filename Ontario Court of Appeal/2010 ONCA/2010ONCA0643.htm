  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>London Police Services Board (LPSB or the Board) seeks
    an order requiring Scott Pickard to post security for costs for the appeal he
    has taken from the decision of Little J. of the Superior Court of Justice who
    dismissed Pickard’s claim against the Board as statute-barred and devoid of
    merit.</p>
  <h3>The Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 7, 1996, an officer of the London Police
    Service laid an information charging Scott Pickard with the summary conviction
    offence of trespassing at night.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 11, 1997, a provincial court judge
    convicted Pickard of the charge, fined him $100 and ordered that he comply with
    the terms of a probation order for a period of two years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 27, 1998, a judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice allowed Pickard’s appeal from conviction, and quashed the
    conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In March 2003, Pickard discovered that the London
    Police Service records management system continued to show that he had been
    convicted on December 11, 1997, of trespassing at night.  The conviction was not recorded on the CPIC
    system.</p>
  <h3>The Civil Action</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pickard gave Notice of Action to the Board on March 2,
    2009.  His Statement of Claim alleged
    malicious prosecution, slander and various infringements of his <i>Charter</i> rights.  </p>
  <h3>The Motion
  to Dismiss</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 25, 2010, the Board filed a motion to
    dismiss Pickard’s action and strike his Statement of Claim on the basis that
    the Notice of Action was issued after the expiration of the relevant
    limitations periods and the Statement of Claim failed to disclose a reasonable cause
    of action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion filed by the Board invoked Rules 21.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) and 21.01(3)(d).</p>
  <h3>The
    Decision of the Motion Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 7, 2010, Little J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice heard the motion.  In a brief
    endorsement, he dismissed the action on the ground that it was
    statute-barred.  Little J. also described
    the allegations contained in the claim as ill-defined, non-existent and
    groundless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge awarded costs of $6,000 against
    Pickard.</p>
  <h3>The
    Appellate Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By Notice of Appeal dated May 6, 2010, Pickard has
    appealed the decision of Little J. dismissing his action against the
    Board.  Within two months of filing his
    original Notice of Appeal, Pickard has filed two further notices amending the
    original notice.  He has not yet
    perfected his appeal, nor has he paid the costs award made against him on
    dismissal of his action.</p>
  
  
  <h3>The Motion
    for Security for Costs</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board applies under Rules 61.06(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    and 61.06(1)(b) for an order for security for costs of the appeal in the amount
    of $14,000.00.</p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board says that the appeal filed by Pickard is
    frivolous and vexatious.  Pickard has
    insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the Board’s costs when his (Pickard’s)
    appeal fails, as inevitably it must.  His
    financial state is best evidenced by his failure to pay the modest costs award
    made by Little J. at first instance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pickard contends that the appeal is neither frivolous
    nor vexatious. The motion before Little J. was based on Rule 21, yet the motion
    judge dismissed it by invoking Rule 20.  The motion judge also erred in concluding that Pickard’s cause of action
    arose on the date of his acquittal on appeal, April 27, 1998, rather than in
    March, 2003, when Pickard discovered that the London Police Service had not
    removed the quashed conviction from its records management system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pickard further argues that the motion judge had an
    inadequate evidentiary record upon which to ground his conclusion that the claim
    had not merit.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 61.06(1) affords three discrete bases upon which a
    judge may order an appellant to provide security for costs of an appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          there is
    good reason to believe that the appeal is frivolous and   vexatious and that the appellant has insufficient Ontario assets to
    pay     the appeal costs;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.         an order for security for costs could
    be made against the appellant        under
    Rule 56.01; or</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.       <span class=GramE>there</span> is some
    other good reason to order security for costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The language of Rule 61.06 is permissive, not
    mandatory.  A respondent is not entitled
    as of right to an order for security for costs for the appeal.  The permissive “may” and not the imperative
    or mandatory “shall” frames the authority to make the order.  Even if the respondent meets the requirements
    in the applicable paragraph of Rule 61.06(1), the permissive “<span
class=GramE>may” would</span> seem to reserve to the motion judge a vestige of
    discretion to refuse the order.  The
    overarching principle to be applied to all the circumstances is the justness of
    the order sought.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modifier “good reason to believe” applies to both
    requirements in Rule 61.06(1)(a):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appeal is frivolous and vexatious</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant has insufficient assets in Ontario
    to pay the costs of the appeal</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The standard imposed by “good
    reason to believe” does not demand that the motion <span class=GramE>judge
    reach</span> a definitive conclusion, make an affirmative finding or actually
    determine that the appeal is frivolous and vexatious and that the appellant
    lacks sufficient Ontario assets to pay the appeal costs.  Rather, “good reason to believe” suggests a
    tentative conclusion of absence of merit and assets:  <i>Schmidt
    v. Toronto-Dominion Bank </i>(1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 5.  After all, the order for security for costs
    is neither dispositive of the appeal nor fully informed in the absence of a
    complete record of the proceedings at first instance. The standard reflects an
    appropriate balance of competing interests, not demanding too much of the
    respondent or settling for too little from the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A frivolous appeal is one readily recognizable as
    devoid of merit, as one having little prospect of success.  The reasons may vary.  A vexatious appeal is one taken to annoy or
    embarrass the opposite party, sometimes fuelled by the hope of financial
    recovery to relieve the respondent’s aggravation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 61.06(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) incorporates
    the provisions of Rule 56.01 as a basis upon which security for costs for an
    appeal may be ordered.  In this case, the
    only additional basis lies in Rule 56.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c), which permits
    an order for security for costs because the Board has an order for costs
    against Pickard made by Little J. in the proceedings below that remains unpaid.</p>
  
  
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed Pickard’s claim because it
    was statute-barred.  The cause of action arose
    in 1998 when Pickard’s conviction was set aside, thus should have been removed
    from the London Police Services’ Records of Convictions. The action against the
    Board was begun over a decade later.  The
    relevant limitation periods had long since expired, according to the motion
    judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also appears to have concluded that
    the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is good reason to believe that the appeal from
    the order of Little J. is frivolous and vexatious. The principal claim advanced
    by Pickard is one of malicious prosecution.  Proceedings against him ended when his conviction was quashed on April
    27, 1998.  Undue retention of his then
    recorded conviction in local police <span class=GramE>files was</span> not a
    prosecution, nor the continuation of the earlier prosecution.  By any statute of general or specific
    application, the limitation period had expired when his notice of action and
    statement of claim were filed.  His
    further claim for <i>Charter</i> damages is
    incapable of definition, not to mention proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By his own admission, Scott Pickard has insufficient
    assets to pay an award of costs. He has not paid the costs ordered by Little
    J.  He admits he has no money.  Documents served on him are delivered to a mailbox.  We do not know where he lives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine whether it is just to make an order for
    security for costs of the appeal in this case, I have considered whether to do
    so would deny Pickard access to justice.  For all practical purposes, such an order would prevent his pursuit of
    an appeal.  But it is an appeal that
    appears at once frivolous and vexatious.  The original claims were filed well out of time. The turgid statement of
    claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.  Access to justice is not a passport that entitles the bearer to pursue
    endlessly and prosecute interminably hopeless causes against public bodies on
    the taxpayers’ dime.  To deny meritless
    claims is not to curtail access to justice, rather to facilitate access to
    justice by making room for legitimate claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board seeks an order for security for costs for the
    appeal. In the circumstances, I see no reason not to make such an order.  The amounts suggested by the Board seem
    somewhat excessive in light of the issues raised.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, Scott Pickard is ordered to post
    security for costs of the motion below and of the appeal in the total amount of
    $8,000.00. The security shall be in a form satisfactory to counsel for the
    respondent and shall be deposited with the Registrar of this court within 60
    days of this order.  Until the security
    has been given, the appellant may not take any further steps in this proceeding
    except an appeal from this order.  In the
    event security is posted, Pickard shall have 60 days from that date to perfect
    his appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board is entitled to its costs of this motion,
    which I fix at $1,500.00 inclusive of all applicable taxes payable by Pickard
    within 30 days of this order.</p>
