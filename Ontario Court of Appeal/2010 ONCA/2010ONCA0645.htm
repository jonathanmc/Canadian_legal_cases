  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richard John Charles <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> (<span class=SpellE>Galustian</span>) and ISI International Ltd. (ISI)
    commenced an action against several individuals and corporations claiming
    declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract, conspiracy and
    defamation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The individual and corporate defendants moved before a
    judge of the Superior Court of Justice to dismiss the action begun against them
    by <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> and ISI on the ground that Ontario
    courts lack jurisdiction over the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 13, 2010, Spence J. dismissed the action for
    want of jurisdiction and assessed costs against <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> and ISI.  The substantial costs awarded
    in favour of each defendant remain unpaid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> and ISI have
    appealed the decision of Spence J. and perfected their appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The individual and corporate defendants, the
    respondents in the appeal, move for an order for security for costs for the
    appeal, as well as for the proceeding before Spence J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, the moving parties are
    entitled to an order for security for costs, albeit not in the full amounts
    they seek.</p>
  <h3>The Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A brief description of the <i>dramatis</i> <i>personae </i>and
    their relationship that underpins the claims advanced by <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> and ISI is adequate for the purposes of this motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> is a citizen of the
    United Kingdom.  He lives and carries on
    business in Dubai and elsewhere in the Middle East, including Iraq.  He is the beneficial owner and a director of
    ISI, a Dubai-incorporated company.  In
    his personal capacity and through ISI, <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> is
    involved in security services, communications, secure housing and logistical
    support activities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span> group of
    companies (<span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span>) is incorporated in Ontario and
    carries on business throughout the world in transportation and logistics. Its
    principal shareholders are Walter <span class=SpellE>Arbib</span> (<span
class=SpellE>Arbib</span>) and <span class=SpellE>Surjit</span> <span
class=SpellE>Babra</span> (<span class=SpellE>Babra</span>).   Both <span class=SpellE>Arbib</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Babra</span> live in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael Douglas (Douglas) is a citizen of the United
    Kingdom who lives in Dubai.  He worked
    for <span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span> at the time the cause of action arose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>John J. (Jack) Holly (Holly) is an American citizen who
    lives in California.  For several years
    he worked in Iraq for the U.S. government.  There, he served as Director of Reconstruction Logistics in the United
    States Department of Defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his original action, <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> sued <span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span> only to recover a 10 percent
    shareholding he claims to have been promised in a related company incorporated
    to operate in the logistics business in Iraq and the Middle East.  The agreement involved <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span>,
    Douglas and <span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For procedural reasons, <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> discontinued his original action and commenced an action that, after various
    amendments, alleged breach of contract, conspiracy and defamation and included
    all individual and corporate defendants.</p>
  <h3>The Other
    Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span>, through a
    wholly-owned subsidiary began proceedings in Dubai in April 2009 against
    Douglas and <span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span> Arabia.  <span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span> alleges that
    Douglas withheld profits and <span class=SpellE>SkyLink</span> Arabia’s
    securities. A Dubai court has assumed jurisdiction over this dispute and will
    have to determine share entitlement, including <span class=SpellE>Galustian’s</span> entitlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> has also begun
    proceedings against Holly in Virginia.  There, he seeks damages for defamation for the same conduct that funds
    his claim here. The facts pleaded in Virginia mirror those pleaded here. The
    jurisdiction of the Virginia court is also <span class=SpellE>controverted</span> in those proceedings.  </p>
  <h3>The
    Decision of the Motion Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Spence J. dismissed the action on the basis that there
    was no real and substantial connection between the <span class=GramE>forum</span> selected (Ontario) and either the claim (an alleged agreement and other conduct
    in Dubai) or the defendants.  The motion
    judge considered the suit in Ontario particularly unfair to Douglas and Holly, <span
class=GramE>neither of whom had or</span> have any connection to this
    province.  Indeed, neither <span
class=SpellE>Galustian</span> nor ISI has any independent link to Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge considered that the core of this
    action is in Dubai where litigation about it has already begun and should
    continue.</p>
  <h3>The
    Positions of the Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties invoke Rule 61.06(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) and its incorporation of Rule 56.01 as the source for
    their claim for security for costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hamer</span>, for Douglas,
    carried the bulk of the argument for the moving parties.  He submitted that they had made out their
    case under any or all of Rules 56.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a), (b) or
    (d).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hamer</span> says that <span
class=SpellE>Galustian</span> is a Dubai resident with no connection to or
    assets in Ontario.  ISI was incorporated
    in Dubai.  It carries on business there
    and elsewhere in the Middle East.  Like
    its principal, ISI is a Dubai resident, bankrupt of any connection with Ontario
    and without assets here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hamer</span> reminds that <span
class=SpellE>Galustian</span> has begun a parallel proceeding in which he seeks
    the same relief on the same factual allegations against Holly in Virginia.  And there are, as well, parallel proceedings
    against Douglas in Dubai grounded in the same circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hamer</span> contends that <span
class=SpellE>Galustian</span> is a well-resourced claimant conducting
    commercial litigation simultaneously in two jurisdictions.  All the principals in the dispute reside in a
    foreign jurisdiction where its subject-matter arose.  The moving parties are unable to enforce any
    costs award in Dubai, are already owed substantial costs by <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span>,
    and are about to incur further costs responding to an appeal in a jurisdiction
    that has no connection with the substance of or the principals in the dispute.  The failure to seek similar security below is
    not terminal for the claim now advanced.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remaining moving parties adopt the position
    advanced by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hamer</span>.  For Holly, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dantowitz</span> adds that it is Holly whose case falls within the incorporation of Rule 56.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b):  Holly is the
    defendant in the duplicate Virginia proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his brief submissions, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Diskin</span> for the respondent urged dismissal of the motion.  The moving party is not entitled to security
    for costs as of right, nor even upon literal satisfaction of any or all of the
    applicable paragraphs of Rule 56.01(1).  The
    remedy is discretionary. The merits of the appeal are substantial, likely to
    warrant reversal on the merits and of the excessive costs award.  An order for security for costs is
    unwarranted.  <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> is well-resourced. There should be no execution before judgment.</p>
  <h3>The
    Governing Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties have invoked Rules 61.06(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) and (c) in support of their motion, including the
    incorporation by Rule 61.06(1)(b) of Rules 56.01(1)(a)–(d).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The enabling language of Rule 61.06(1), as well of Rule
    56.01(1), is permissive, not imperative.  Each reposes in the judge before whom the
    motion is brought a residuum of discretion to refuse the order notwithstanding
    satisfaction of the requirements of the controlling sub-rule.  The superintending principle that governs is
    the justness of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only Rules 56.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>e) and
    61.06(1)(a) contain an express reference to the merits of the appeal.  In both instances, among other things, the
    moving party must demonstrate that there is good reason to believe that the
    appeal is frivolous and vexatious.  It
    may well be that the merits of the appeal is a factor that warrants
    consideration in connection with the overarching principle of whether it is
    just to make the order.  At all events,
    it would not seem necessary for the moving party to demonstrate the absence of
    merit to the appeal in order to meet the requirements of Rules 56.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a)–(d) and 61.06(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The phrase “good reason to believe” appears in Rule
    56.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) upon which the moving parties rely.  It also appears in Rule 61.06(1)(a) where it
    has been interpreted as indicative of a finding falling short of an actual
    determination or firm conclusion: <i>Schmidt
    v. Toronto-Dominion Bank</i> (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 5.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 56.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) focuses upon
    the sufficiency of the Ontario assets of a corporation or nominal plaintiff or
    applicant to pay the relevant costs.  The
    financial responsibility of the beneficial owner of the corporation, a nominal
    plaintiff, would not seem relevant where there is good reason to doubt the
    sufficiency of his or her Ontario assets:  <span class=SpellE><i>Lindhorst</i></span><i> v. Aviva
    Insurance Co. of Canada</i>, 2009 ONCA 191.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These proceedings arise out of commercial transactions
    involving experienced, sophisticated parties.  There seems no reason in principle why the moving parties should bear
    the risk of success, yet find it hollow because their substantial costs are
    beyond recovery: <i>Aegis Biomedical
    Technologies Ltd. v. <span class=SpellE>Jackowski</span> </i>(1996), 28 O.R.
    (3d) 558 (C.A. – <span class=SpellE>Ch’rs</span>), at p. 560.</p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several circumstances sufficient to engage the
    discretion to award security for costs are evident here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conduct upon which the claims for breach of
    contract, conspiracy and defamation are based took place in Dubai and elsewhere
    in the Middle East.  The alleged
    agreement involved an interest in a Dubai company. The principals, <span
class=SpellE>Galustian</span> and Douglas, lived and worked in Dubai.   It was there and elsewhere in the Middle
    East that the new company was to carry on its business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> is a citizen of the
    United Kingdom.  He lives in Dubai.  He is not and never has been a resident of
    Ontario, nor does he have any business or other connection with this province.  He has no assets here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> has begun and is
    actively pursuing another proceeding for the same relief he seeks here.  In Virginia.  Against Holly, albeit not the other defendants
    who seek security for costs.  The factual
    underpinnings of his Virginia claim, as well the remedy he seeks, replicate
    those alleged and sought here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The costs award made by Spence J. on the motion to
    dismiss the action remains outstanding. The amounts are substantial. Nothing
    has been paid. Not a nickel. To anyone.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ISI, a Dubai corporation, is a nominal plaintiff in the
    action.  It is a corporate vehicle through
    which <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> conducts some of his business.  There is good reason to believe ISI has no
    assets here. Its sole connection to this province seems to be its involvement
    in this litigation.  ISI has never
    carried on business in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> has chosen to sue
    here, thus to be subject to the rules of the forum he has chosen.  Those rules dictate, in these circumstances,
    that he <span class=GramE>provide</span> security for costs of both the
    proceedings below and of the appeal.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, <span class=SpellE>Galustian</span> and ISI will post security for costs in a form satisfactory to the respondents
