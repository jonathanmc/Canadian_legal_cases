  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Katrina Kiyoshk disappeared in the early hours of
    August 8, 2005 on Walpole Island First Nation Reserve.  On September 1, 2005, her body was found at
    the edge of a marsh near Dynamite Cut Road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim was last seen entering a car with two men:
    Nathaniel Shipman, and the appellant, Kristin Johnson.  Following a police investigation, both men
    were arrested.  Nathaniel Shipman pled
    guilty to being an accessory after the fact to murder and identified the
    appellant as the victim’s killer.  The
    appellant denied any involvement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial before Desotti J., sitting with a
    jury, the appellant was acquitted of first degree murder, but convicted of
    second degree murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the
    possibility of parole for fourteen years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the appellant raises ten grounds of
    appeal related to the admissibility of similar fact evidence, improper conduct
    by the trial Crown, reasonable apprehension of bias, improper jury vetting and
    other matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal
    and order a new trial.  Although I am
    troubled by several of the issues raised by the appellant, they need not be
    addressed in these reasons. In my view, the improper admission of two pieces of
    similar fact evidence is, standing alone, sufficient to warrant a new
    trial.  Consequently, these reasons will
    focus on this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></u></h4>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 7 AND THE
    DISCOVERY OF THE KILLING</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant and Nathaniel Shipman were friends, and socialized regularly.  They often would “cruise” around Walpole
    Island in the appellant’s car while drinking heavily.  “Cruising” was a common form of socializing
    for many residents of Walpole Island.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    victim, Katrina Kiyoshk, who had just turned 17, was also an acquaintance of
    Nathaniel Shipman.  The two moved in the
    same circle of friends.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
    the late night of August 7, 2005, the victim attended a party at Garrick
    Shipman’s home, where she became intoxicated.  The appellant and Nathaniel Shipman had been cruising around Walpole
    Island and eventually ended up outside of Garrick Shipman’s house.  By this time the appellant was also
    intoxicated.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    victim left the party with the appellant and Nathaniel Shipman.  The group began driving around the island,
    ultimately arriving at an area known as the Sand Pits.  While the evidence differed as to the exact
    sequence of events at the Sand Pits, it was acknowledged that upon their
    arrival, both men had sex with the victim.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
    happened next was the subject of dispute, and formed the focus of the
    appellant’s trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
    is clear is that some time following the events at the Sand Pits, the victim
    died.  However, her body was not
    discovered for almost a month.  It was
    not uncommon for the victim to stay away from her home for extended periods of
    time.  As a result, when the victim did
    not return home on August 8, her family was not seriously concerned.  About one week later, the victim’s sister
    began to worry, and contacted police.  However, when police came to interview her, she was inebriated and
    unable to provide them with any useful information.  About a week after that<span class=GramE>,  on</span> August 25, the victim’s mother also
    became concerned and filed an official missing persons report.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    September 1, 2005, two men from Walpole Island found the victim’s body at the
    edge of a marsh, near Dynamite Cut Road.  It appeared that the body had been there for some time.  Subsequent forensic analysis was unable to
    determine the cause of death, or accurately determine when death occurred.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.  THE POLICE INVESTIGATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following
    the discovery of the victim’s body, the Ontario Provincial Police began an
    investigation into her death.  Witnesses
    informed police that the victim was seen entering a car outside of Garrick
    Shipman’s on the night of the August 7 with the appellant and Nathaniel
    Shipman.  On September 11, 2005,
    Nathaniel Shipman was questioned by the Ontario Provincial Police about the
    victim’s disappearance.  During this
    questioning, Mr. Shipman became aware that the police had located the victim’s
    body and that they considered him a suspect in the killing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Over
    the course of the day, Nathaniel Shipman made several formal statements to the
    police, in addition to various utterances.  During his first statement, which was under oath and videotaped, he was
    confronted with evidence from other witnesses who claimed to have seen the
    victim get into the car with him and the appellant outside of Garrick
    Shipman’s.  He admitted to having picked
    her up, but said that he dropped her off at her home 20-30 minutes later.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following
    the first interview, Constable Phillip George offered to give Mr. Shipman a
    ride home.  Constable George and Mr.
    Shipman knew one another from a previous investigation into the death of Mr.
    Shipman’s younger sister in an automobile accident.  By all accounts, Nathaniel Shipman trusted
    Constable George.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    driving, Constable George told Mr. Shipman that he believed he knew more about
    the victim’s death than he had admitted during his interview.  Mr. Shipman eventually stated that the
    appellant had killed the victim.  Mr.
    Shipman was then brought back to the O.P.P. detachment, where he provided a
    further videotaped statement implicating the appellant.  He also admitted that after the killing, he
    assisted the appellant in moving the victim’s body.  He maintained, however, that he did not play
    a role in the killing itself.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following
    this statement, Nathaniel Shipman was charged with first degree murder.  He subsequently pled guilty to being an
    accessory after the fact to murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    September 11, 2005, the O.P.P. also attended the appellant’s residence to speak
    with him about the victim’s death.  Following Nathaniel Shipman’s incriminating statement, the police
    arrested the appellant.  Upon being
    advised of the charge, the appellant immediately responded, “It wasn’t me, I didn’t
    do it.”  He was then brought to the
    police detachment where he was interrogated into the early hours of September
    12th.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prior
    to the interrogation, the appellant spoke with duty counsel who advised him not
    to make any statement to the police.  The
    appellant told police that he had received this advice, and that he would be
    remaining silent.  While police continued
    to question the appellant for several hours, he largely declined to make any
    substantive statement.  However, he did
    not remain entirely silent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition to repeatedly stating that he had been advised not to answer
    questions, the appellant commented on his relationship with Nathaniel Shipman,
    his own good character, the fact that when he drank he could become
    temperamental or black out, and that he was innocent.  He also made two statements that he would
    subsequently admit were lies.  First, the
    appellant said that he had never had sex with the victim.  Second, he asserted that, due to his
    intoxication, he had no memory of the night in question.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    response to the appellant’s comments about how drinking would sometimes lead
    him to black out or suffer from memory loss, the police suggested to him that
    perhaps he had killed the victim and simply could not remember it.  The appellant’s response was unclear.  Although he maintained that he did not
    remember the events of the night, he maintained that had he killed the victim,
    he would have recalled doing so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant was charged with first degree murder.  The voluntariness of his statements to police was ultimately not an issue
    at trial.</span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>III. THE JURY VETTING</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    appears that the Sarnia Crown Attorney’s Office had a standing practice to
    request that local police perform searches with the Canadian Police Information
    Centre (CPIC) to determine whether prospective jurors had criminal
    records.  Where the CPIC checks recorded
    a “hit” with respect to a name on the jury roll, police would place a “NO”
    notation next to the name.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown’s office followed this practice prior to the appellant’s trial.  It obtained a notated list of potential
    jurors.  However, <span class=GramE>this
    list was not disclosed to the counsel for the appellant, nor were</span> they
    informed that jury vetting had occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following
    the completion of the trial, the use of police services to screen potential
    jurors came to the attention of the media, and ultimately resulted in an
    investigation by Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner:  see PO-2826 – <i>Excessive Background Checks Conducted on Prospective Jurors: A Special
    Investigation Report</i> (Toronto: Information and Privacy Commissioner of
    Ontario, 2009).  As a result of this
    publicity, counsel for the appellant on this appeal made inquiries with the
    Crown, and the above-noted conduct was disclosed.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.       THE EVENTS OF AUGUST 7-8, 2005</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both
    Nathaniel Shipman and the appellant testified at trial.  Each described the events of August 7-8,
    2005.  Their respective version of events
    differed dramatically.</span></p>
  <h3><span
lang=EN-US>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Nathaniel Shipman’s Version of
    Events</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
    to Nathaniel Shipman, the appellant picked him up in the late afternoon of
    August 7, and the two cruised around Walpole Island for a number of hours.  At some point Nathaniel Shipman took over
    driving.  The two men arrived at Garrick
    Shipman’s home just as it was starting to become dark outside.  Both the victim and another woman, Carmen
    Dodge, got into the car.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    dropping Ms. Dodge off at her home, the remaining three passengers continued to
    cruise around the island, eventually ending up at the Sand Pits.  While the appellant remained inside the car,
    Nathaniel Shipman and the victim got out, and proceeded to have intercourse.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Afterwards,
    the appellant expressed a desire to have sex with the victim.  She did not want to have sex in front of
    Nathaniel Shipman, and so she and the appellant went behind the car while
    Nathaniel Shipman sat in the front seat.  The victim and the appellant then had sex.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    approximately 30-45 minutes at the Sand Pits, the three left the area.  Nathaniel Shipman drove the car, the
    appellant sat in the passenger side seat, and the victim sat on the appellant’s
    lap.  She whispered into the appellant’s
    ear while Nathaniel Shipman drove.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant then directed Nathaniel Shipman to drive to Dynamite Cut Road.  They arrived there about or shortly after dusk.  The appellant and the victim got out of the
    car, while Nathaniel Shipman remained inside.  Nathaniel Shipman did not have a clear view of his companions, but it
    looked to him as though they were again engaging in intercourse on the ground
    outside of the car.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span

    some time, Nathaniel Shipman heard what he described as a “goggling” sound,
    which made him get out of the car to get a better view of the victim and the
    appellant.  He saw that the appellant was
    on top of the victim and had her in a “bear hug”.  Initially, he believed that the two were
    still having sex, but within a few moments, he realized that something was
    wrong, and that the victim was dead.</span></p>

    Shipman drove further down Dynamite Cut Road.  The appellant then removed the victim’s body and carried it down a trail
    while Nathaniel Shipman remained with the car.  After a few minutes, the appellant returned without the victim.  The appellant told Nathaniel Shipman not to

  <h3><span
lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Appellant’s Version of Events</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he and <span lang=EN-US>Nathaniel Shipman had been cruising around
    Walpole Island on August <span class=GramE>7,</span> and arrived at Garrick
    Shipman’s house at around 7 p.m.  The
    appellant was extremely intoxicated at this point and did not recall the victim
    getting into the car.  His next memory
    was being at the Sand Pits.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>He
    recalled having sex with the victim on the ground outside of the car.  When he was done, he moved away to
    urinate.  When he turned back towards the
    car, he saw the victim on the ground, crying, and Nathaniel Shipman walking
    back to the car.  The victim said “fuck
    you” to Nathaniel Shipman.  The appellant
    asked her why she was upset, but she did not respond.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant stated that he never saw <span
lang=EN-US>Nathaniel Shipman and the victim
    have sex.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All three individuals returned to the car.  <span lang=EN-US>Nathaniel Shipman drove, while the appellant sat in the front passenger
    seat.  The victim sat in the back seat of
    the car.  From this position, the victim
    attempted to change the station that the car radio was tuned to.  Nathaniel Shipman objected to this, and the
    two began to argue.  Frustrated by this,
    the appellant asked Nathaniel Shipman to drop him off at his <span class=GramE>aunt</span> Joyce’s home, where he was living at the time.  Nathaniel Shipman did so and then drove off with the victim in the car.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant stated that <span lang=EN-US>Nathaniel Shipman returned his car to him
    sometime in the morning of August 8.  When pressed during cross-examination, he estimated that it was dropped
    off sometime around 10 am.</span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>V.    THE CROWN’S CROSS-EXAMINATION
    OF THE APPELLANT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown cross-examined the appellant extensively on
    the differences between his trial testimony, and what he told police in
    September 2005.  Specifically, the Crown
    challenged the appellant’s assertion that between his police interrogation in
    2005, and his testimony in 2008, he had recovered memories of the events of
    August 7-8, 2005.  The Crown also questioned
    the appellant concerning his admission that, contrary to what he had told
    police in 2005, he had, in fact, had sexual intercourse with the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When questioning the appellant about his recovered
    memories, the Crown pressed him on his failure to have come forth to deny the
    accusations.  Specifically, the Crown
    asked the appellant, “This is two years ago and you never said anything until
    today?” and later in the cross-examination asked:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        So,
    you think it was better for your children for you to sit in jail for two years
    thinking you were a murderer without telling anyone until today that you
    weren’t?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel objected after this second question,
    and the trial judge directed the Crown to discontinue this line of questioning.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>VI.  ALIBI, REBUTTAL, AND THE <i>EX PARTE</i> COMMUNICATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence closed its case on Wednesday, February 13,
    2008.  The Crown immediately gave notice
    of the possibility that it would be calling reply evidence.  As this was the first time that it had heard
    the appellant’s version of the events, the Crown indicated that it required
    some time to conduct investigations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant at trial requested disclosure
    of any reply evidence as soon as possible, to allow for time to prepare.  He expressed concern that the Crown might be
    seeking to split its case or to contradict the appellant on collateral issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown took the position that the appellant’s
    testimony constituted an alibi, which the appellant had failed to disclose to
    the authorities in a timely manner.  In
    the Crown’s view, the appellant effectively testified that he was at his aunt’s
    house in the early morning of August 8, when the victim was killed, and as
    such, could not have been the killer.  The Crown sought an instruction that the jury could draw an adverse
    inference for the failure to disclose this alibi.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel disagreed with this characterization of
    the appellant’s testimony.  The defence`s
    theory of the case was not that the victim was killed in the early morning of
    August 8 by Nathaniel Shipman, or that there was independent evidence that
    confirmed that the appellant was elsewhere at the time of the killing.  They took no position as to when the killing
    occurred, or who was responsible for it.   The defence position was simply that when the appellant had last seen
    the victim, she was alive.  This was all
    that the appellant had testified to.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pre-charge discussions continued throughout the day on
    Thursday, February 14.  Before leaving
    for the weekend, the trial judge expressed a tentative opinion that the
    appellant’s testimony did not constitute alibi evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The alibi, I am having a tough time with that.  I just do not see it as necessarily falling
    within that, the concept of alibi and it may be, and I am just going to think
    about this a little more because of the timeframe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court regularly took Fridays off, and the following
    Monday was Family Day.  Therefore, the
    parties expected to deal next with the alibi issue and any proposed reply
    evidence on Tuesday, February 19, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the course of the weekend, the trial judge changed
    his mind and reached the conclusion that the appellant had given an alibi
    during his testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Sunday, February 17, at approximately 10 p.m., the
    trial judge personally contacted the Crown Attorney for Sarnia, not the Assistant
    Crown Attorney assigned to the case, and informed her that he had concluded
    that the defendant had <span class=GramE>raised  a</span> defence in the nature of alibi.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No phone call to defence counsel was made at this
    time.  Rather, on the following Tuesday,
    before the start of court, the trial judge met with the Crown and defence
    counsel in chambers, and informed the latter of the weekend’s phone call. The
    trial judge subsequently explained that he had contacted the Crown in order to ensure
    that he had not misled it as to his view of the evidence while it was
    conducting its investigation for reply evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following day, the appellant applied for a mistrial
    on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias.  Before submissions were heard, the trial
    judge read a prepared statement of his reasons for contacting the Crown
    attorney on the preceding weekend.  He
    then heard submissions, and dismissed the application “for reasons expressed”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant then sought an adjournment to better
    prepare for argument on the admissibility of the reply evidence, disclosure
    having only recently been made.  The
    trial judge gave him until the afternoon to prepare.  Following submissions, the trial judge ruled
    the Crown’s proposed reply evidence to be admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s main reply witness was Candace
    Shipman.  She had also been at Garrick
    Shipman’s house on the night of August 7, 2005, and had slept in Garrick’s
    truck until the morning of August 8.  She
    testified that sometime around 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. she saw the appellant’s
    vehicle pull up by the residence and saw the appellant get out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s purpose in introducing this evidence was to
    rebut the appellant’s story that <span lang=EN-US>Nathaniel Shipman had the car in the early morning hours of August 8,
    and only returned it to the appellant later in the morning.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Candace Shipman had earlier provided two statements to
    the police: one on September 5, 2005, and the second on September 15,
    2005.  In the latter statement she told
    police that she had seen the appellant’s car at Garrick Shipman’s house on the
    morning of August 8, but made no mention of seeing the appellant there.  When confronted with this by defence counsel
    during cross-examination, she explained that no one had asked her whether she
    saw the appellant there that morning or not.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
    its case in chief, the Crown was permitted to introduce similar fact evidence
    in the form of two previous incidents involving the appellant.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown called Shawn Soney to testify about an incident that occurred in the
    summer of 2005.  He testified that he had
    little recollection of the incident and therefore testified with the assistance
    of his statement to the police.  Against
    that background, Mr. Soney stated that he and the appellant had been driving
    around Walpole Island with Michelle Aquash, an acquaintance who wanted a ride
    to purchase cigarettes and beer.  After
    purchasing these items, as well as additional gas for the car, the three
    continued to drive around the area.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant eventually stopped the car on Black Shack Road.  While Ms. Aquash remained in the car, the
    appellant and Mr. Soney got out of the vehicle.  The appellant told Mr. Soney that he wanted “to do” Ms. Aquash, meaning
    beat her up.  Mr. Soney told him that he
    could not do that.  The appellant then
    began to cry.</span></p>

    out” during this conversation.  He also
    described the appellant as depressed, and even suicidal.  He explained that the appellant had recently
    broken up with his girlfriend.  His
    evidence was that there had been no attempt to have sex, beat up or otherwise
    touch Ms. Aquash.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant’s version of this incident was quite different.  He stated that Ms. Aquash had asked for a
    ride in order to go to the bank and then to buy some beer.  The appellant agreed to give her a ride if
    she would pay for the gas.  While
    initially she agreed, she later refused to pay.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Out
    of anger, the appellant drove out to Black Shack Road.  His intention was to take the beer that she
    had purchased, and leave her stranded on the road.  Mr. Soney convinced him not to do so and they
    drove back to the community without incident.</span></p>

    Shipman, the victim’s younger cousin who was 14 years old in the summer of
    2005, was called to testify about an incident involving the appellant and the
    victim that occurred prior to the victim’s disappearance.  In a <i>voir
    dire</i>, Ms. Shipman said that it had occurred in the fall of 2004, but in her
    trial testimony she placed it in late spring 2005.  In many respects she was unable to recall certain
    details of the white truck incident that one would expect her to have
    remembered.  She equivocated on other
    details and she was inconsistent on yet others.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    essence of her testimony was that she, the appellant, the victim, Briana
    Aquash, and a man who she did not recognize were all driving around in the
    appellant’s white truck.  The victim sat in
    the front between the appellant and the other man.  Briana Aquash and Clarissa Shipman were
    seated in the rear.  The victim and
    Briana Aquash began to fight, which annoyed the appellant.</span></p>

    frustrated, pulled the victim out of the vehicle and told her that she would
    have to walk back unless she stopped fighting.  When she promised that she would no longer fight with Briana Aquash, the
    appellant let her back into the vehicle.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An
    important theme in the Crown’s closing argument was that the appellant did not
    react as an innocent person would when, during the police interrogation, he was
    confronted with Nathaniel Shipman’s police statement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
    a pre-trial application, the trial judge ruled that “the jury cannot use the
    silence of the accused during his videotaped statement to draw an adverse
    inference when the accused exercised his right to remain silent.”  Notwithstanding this ruling, the Crown made
    the following comments to the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Y]ou heard that during the course of the interview
    Nate [Shipman] is actually brought in to see him, Nate his friend.  And [the appellant] doesn’t say a word….
    Well, put yourself there then.  And if
    they told you your good friend just said you murdered someone and that person
    was brought in, you don’t think you’d go, ‘What are you talking about?  I didn’t do that.’  Isn’t that the first thing you’re going to
    do?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence objected to this aspect of the Crown’s
    closing address.  Not only did these

    at the time of his arrest, the appellant explicitly asserted his innocence.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge charged the jury over the course of approximately three hours.  During his charge, he instructed the jury on their
    duties as jurors, as well as the law that they were to apply.  He also engaged in a review of the evidence
    that had been adduced during the trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Prior
    to reviewing the theories of the Crown and the defence, the trial judge
    provided an instruction to the jury with respect to the rule from <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> (1893), 6 R. 67
    (H.L.).  <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> provides that if counsel is going to challenge the
    credibility of a witness by calling contradictory evidence, out of fairness, the
    witness is to be given the opportunity to address the contradictory evidence in
    cross-examination.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the view of the trial judge, defence counsel
    violated the rule ten times with respect to Nathaniel Shipman, and four times
    with respect to Shawn Soney by adducing evidence from the appellant that
    contradicted particular aspects of their testimony.  The trial judge reviewed the evidence on each
    of these points, and instructed the jury that they could consider the failure
    to put the appellant’s version of events to these two witnesses “when weighing
    the evidence of the accused,<span lang=EN-US>”</span> although this did not “necessitate an adverse inference in respect of the

    evidence ground of appeal I will first briefly review the principles that
    underlie the similar fact evidence rule and then outline the test to be applied
    by a trial judge when considering the admissibility of similar fact evidence.</p>
  <h3>I.    GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    fundamental rule that underpins the law of evidence in Canada is that all
    evidence that is logically probative to some material issue at trial is
    relevant, and therefore admissible unless excluded by some particular rule of
    law: <i>R. v. Abbey</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24,
    at p. 40; <i>Morris v. The Queen</i>, [1983]
    2 S.C.R. 190, at p. 201.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    evidence that is relevant may still be inadmissible if it is subject to a
    specific exclusionary rule.  Underlying
    many particular exclusionary rules is the broad principle that where the
    prejudicial effect of admitting otherwise relevant evidence would exceed its
    probative value, it is inadmissible: <i>R.
    v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 736-740; <i>R. v. Potvin</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, at p. 552. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    bad character evidence rule is an example of an exclusionary rule that rests
    upon this general principle.  Evidence of
    the accused’s bad character cannot be adduced simply to show that the accused
    is the sort of person likely to commit the offence charged.  While this evidence might arguably be
    relevant, it is inherently prejudicial when used in this fashion: <i>Morris</i>, at pp. 201-202; <i>R. v. G<span class=GramE>.(</span>S.G.)</i>,
    [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716, at para 63.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One
    particularly prejudicial form of bad character evidence is evidence that
    establishes past criminal conduct on the part of the accused that does <i>not</i> form the basis of the charges before
    the court.  This type of past misconduct
    evidence has been identified as raising two forms of prejudice that will
    generally outweigh any probative value that might exist in the evidence
    itself.  They are commonly referred to as
    moral prejudice and reasoning prejudice: <i>R.
    v. Handy</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at paras. 31, 139-147.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moral
    prejudice refers to the possibility that a jury, presented with evidence of
    uncharged misconduct, might choose to convict an accused person for the crimes
    charged, not because they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    charges have been proven, but as substitute punishment for the uncharged
    misconduct: <i>R. v. D.(L.E.)</i>, [1989] 2
    S.C.R. 111, at p. 128.  Even where a jury
    does not follow this explicit line of reasoning, they might still convict based
    on a belief that the accused is generally the kind of person likely to commit
    crimes, rather than on the basis of any particular evidence showing the accused
    to have committed the specific crime charged: <i>Handy</i>, at para. 139.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Reasoning
    prejudice, on the other hand, refers to the distracting nature of past
    misconduct evidence.  Rather than
    focusing the trial on the question of whether the charges have been proven by
    the Crown, past misconduct evidence risks distracting a jury with evidence of
    other criminal conduct: <i>D. (L.E.)</i>, at
    p. 128; <i>Handy</i>, at para. 144. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Evidence
    that tends to prove the commission of uncharged criminal acts will normally
    appear much like the evidence adduced to prove the commission of charged
    criminal conduct.  Excessive court time
    devoted to proof of extraneous criminal conduct might well distract the jury
    from their ultimate task of considering whether the crimes that have actually
    been charged by the Crown have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Three
    basic principles of evidence – relevance, balancing probative and prejudicial
    impact, and the prohibition against bad character evidence – underpin the
    modern doctrine of ‘similar fact evidence’.  The similar fact evidence rule is really an exception to the
    exclusionary rule related to bad character evidence.  It permits the introduction of evidence
    demonstrating uncharged misconduct on the part of the accused where, due to its
    particular characteristics, its probative value exceeds the prejudicial effect
    normally associated with bad character evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    2002, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in <i>Handy</i>, which rationalized the law of similar fact evidence in
    Canada and provided critical guidance to trial judges on how to determine
    whether the proposed similar fact evidence is to be admitted under a principled
    framework. At the core of this framework is a balancing between prejudice and probative
    value.</span></p>
  <h3><span
lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Threshold Matters</span></h3>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
    engaging in any balancing, the trial judge must first determine the threshold
    question of whether the presumptive exclusionary rule applies. The trial judge must
    determine whether the evidence in question is “discreditable” to the accused,
    in the sense that an ordinary person would disapprove of their conduct: <i>Handy</i>, at para. 34; S. Casey Hill, David
    M. Tanovich &amp; Louis P. Strezos, <i>McWilliams’
    Canadian Criminal Evidence</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. Loose-leaf (Aurora: Canada
    Law Book, 2003), at para. 10:40.10.10<span class=GramE>.  If</span> the evidence is not discreditable,
    the bad character justification for the exclusionary rule is never engaged in
    the first place. The evidence, if relevant, will be admissible, unless excluded
    by some other rule.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge must also determine whether there is some evidentiary link between
    the similar acts and the accused.  Where
    there is no evidence connecting the accused to the similar fact evidence
    itself, the evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible: <i>Sweitzer v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949, at p. 954.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once
    the evidence falls within the exclusionary rule and there is some evidence that
    links the accused to the acts in question, the Crown bears the onus of
    establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that the probative value of the
    similar fact evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.  It is impossible to measure probative value
    without first understanding how the proposed evidence might be relevant. Thus,
    to meet their burden, the Crown must identify a matter in issue that the
    similar fact evidence is relevant to.  As
    Binnie J. explained in Handy at para. 27, “The contest […] is all about
    inferences.”  It is therefore incumbent
    on the Crown to  identify a series of
    inferences that it asks the trier of fact to draw other than that the accused
    is merely of bad character and therefore more likely to have committed the
    offence: <i>R. v. Perrier</i>, [2004] 3
    S.C.R. 228, at para. 18.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[93]<span

    the probative force of the inferences that the Crown asks the jury to draw may
    be inexorably linked with the reliability of the proposed evidence, the trial
    judge must first be satisfied that the proposed evidence is capable of being
    reasonably believed and supporting the inferences that the Crown asks the trier
    of fact to make: <i>Handy</i> at para. 134.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where
    the matter at issue is proof of a motive, a somewhat different analysis is
    required.  Evidence of an accused’s
    motive is relevant, as it can impact questions of identity and intent: <i>Lewis v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 821,
    at p. 833; <i>R. v. Griffin</i>, [2009] 2
    S.C.R. 42, at para. 60.  Consequently,
    evidence establishing motive is normally admissible.  However, where, as in the present case, the
    evidence of motive arises from discreditable conduct, the evidence’s
    admissibility must still be gauged.  In
    these circumstances, motive evidence is not automatically admissible.  The trial judge must still balance probative
    value versus prejudicial effect: <i>R. v.
    Chapman</i> (2006), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 27.  </span></p>

    said<span class=GramE>,</span> motive evidence does not fit neatly within the
    normal similar fact evidence “test”.  This, in large measure, is due to the fact that its probative value does

    as set out at para. 80 of <i>Handy</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[W]here
    the issue is <i>animus</i> of the accused

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    is not sufficient for the Crown to identify some past conflict between an
    accused and a victim, and then speculate that it establishes animus and
    therefore motive.  The Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Barbour</i>, [1938] S.C.R. 465, at p.
    469, warned that “it is rather important that the court should not slip into a
    habit of admitting evidence which, reasonably viewed, cannot tend to prove

    the history of the relations of the parties.”</span></p>

    situation-specific behavior.  However,
    this position was premised not only on the evidence of Shawn Soney, but also on
    a police statement given by Michelle Aquash.  In that statement, Ms. Aquash said that before Mr. Soney and the
    appellant left the vehicle (and unbeknownst to her, discussed attacking her),
    the appellant had made sexual advances towards her, which she rebuffed.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Whether this evidence would have
    been sufficiently similar to the alleged offence became irrelevant when the
    Crown opted to introduce only the evidence of Mr. Soney, who did not testify to
    any sexual context.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In fairness to the trial judge,
    however, his assessment at the admissibility stage had to be premised on the
    application as presented by the Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the White Truck incident, the Crown
    argued that the evidence of Clarissa Shipman was adduced to show a specific
    animus towards the victim on the part of the accused, as well as to illustrate
    another instance of the accused’s cruising around Walpole Island while
    intoxicated, and manifesting violent intent towards a female passenger.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ruled that the evidence respecting both
    incidents was admissible.  Given that
    this case ultimately came down to the credibility of Nathaniel Shipman’s
    version of events, the trial judge identified this as the fact in issue for the
    purposes of the similar fact evidence. By showing similar conduct by the
    accused in similar situations, and by introducing motive evidence, the Crown
    was asking the jury to infer that it was more likely that the accused killed
    the victim, rather than Nathaniel Shipman.  The trial judge concluded that the similar fact evidence had a high
    probative value as it showed that the accused regularly drove around Walpole
    Island while drunk, and when he did so, he acted violently towards female
    passengers. In particular, he acted violently towards the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I have
    concluded that the trial judge erred in admitting this evidence.  It had limited probative value and was
    significantly prejudicial. </span></p>
  <h3><span
lang=EN-US>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Probative Value of the Similar Acts</span></h3>
  <h3>i) The
    Black Shack Road Incident</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in question was identity, which turned on
    credibility.  The Crown’s position was
    premised on establishing a pattern of situation-specific behaviour on the part
    of the appellant to support its case on identity.   In order to have any probative value, the
    evidence needed to exhibit a significant degree of similarity.  The inference that the Crown asked the jury to
    draw from the Black Shack Road incident was essentially one of pure propensity:
    the accused acted in a violent manner towards women and, therefore, he was more
    likely than Nathaniel Shipman to have killed the victim.  The only way in which this evidence had any
    true probative value was if the circumstances surrounding the two incidents
    were sufficiently similar.  Without this
    similarity, all the jury would be left with was evidence that the accused was a
    bad, violent person, and therefore more likely to have committed the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only similarities between Nathaniel Shipman’s
    version of the events of the night of the alleged crime and Shawn Soney’s description
    of the Black Shack Road incident was that both involved cruising around Walpole
    Island with one man and one woman, and that the accused exhibited animus
    towards the female passenger while intoxicated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s theory, however, was that the victim’s
    death occurred in the course of a sexual assault. There was no sexual component
    to either Shawn Soney or the appellant’s version of the Black Shack Road
    Incident.  The Crown elected not to call
    Michelle Aquash, and therefore did not ultimately present the Black Shack Road
    incident as one of rebuffed sexual advances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, although it was reasonably proximate in time
    to the alleged offence, the Black Shack Road incident was an isolated
    occurrence that did not establish a pattern of behaviour, much less a mode of
    operating.  There were no distinctive
    features unifying the incidents.  The Crown
    failed to show that the appellant’s conduct on this occasion was distinctive.  To the contrary, there was evidence that
    drinking and cruising was a behaviour that was practised in the area. The
    incident thus simply did not exhibit sufficient similarities to render it
    particularly probative with respect to identity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting, as the Crown suggests, that the universe of
    potential perpetrators was limited to the appellant and Nathaniel Shipman, to
    overcome the significant prejudicial effect, the similar fact evidence would
    only be admissible if it demonstrated a specific propensity to commit serious
    violence to women in similar circumstances.  Without the sexual component, the evidence lacked the degree of
    distinctiveness necessary to demonstrate the specific propensity even where the
    universe of potential perpetrators was as limited as alleged in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At best this evidence might establish that the accused
    was violent when intoxicated.  In light
    of the prejudicial impact of this evidence, this is not so unique as to make
    the evidence sufficiently probative as to avoid the general exclusionary rule.  </p>
  <h3>ii)
    The White Truck Incident</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The value of the White Truck incident was problematic
    for entirely different reasons.  As
    motive evidence, it did not rely on any significant measure of similarity. What
    was important was the value the incident could provide with respect to
    establishing a motive for the killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arguably, the incident showed that the accused disliked
    the victim, even to the point of violence.  However, it is not sufficient to show some dispute between victim and
    accused and label it motive.  The past
    incident must have real significance and a logical connection to the offence
    charged to be probative: <i>Cloutier v. The
    Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709, at p. 736; <i>Barbour</i>,
    at p. 470.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the animating context of the appellant’s
    actions in the White Truck incident was entirely unconnected to the animus that
    was supposed to have motivated the alleged offence.  By all accounts, what animated the actions of
    the appellant during the White Truck incident was the unwelcome behaviour of a
    disruptive and argumentative teenager.  The
    incident seems to be an isolated one in the relationship (whatever this
    relationship was) between the appellant and the victim.  There was no evidence that the appellant
    continued to harbour significant resentment against the victim from this
    incident that could suggest he decided to kill her on August 7-8, 2005.  Rather, the Crown’s theory was that the
    killing occurred as part of a sexual assault, an incident far removed from a
    past incidence of violence occasioned by annoyance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from acting as motive evidence, the incident only
    served to show that on one occasion in the past the appellant acted violently
    towards the victim.  In that respect, the
    evidence was admittedly more probative on the issues of identity and credibility
    than the Black Shack Road incident: here, the accused actually did act
    violently, and his target was the victim herself.  However, this incident and the offence had no
    distinctive features unifying them, and were different in many key respects,
    limiting its probative value on this issue.  As noted earlier, the White Truck incident was
    triggered by a misbehaving teenager, while the offence was, on the Crown
    theory, sexually motivated.  The White
    Truck incident occurred in daylight with a full car, with several people
    watching, while the charged offence happened at night and in isolation, where
    even Nathaniel Shipman could not see the events closely.  In my view, the context and circumstances
    were so different such that the way the appellant acted towards the victim on
    the prior occasion would tell the jury very little about the likelihood of his
    acting in a similar manner on the occasion leading to the victim’s death.  As noted in <i>Handy</i> at para. 130, “common sense” cannot safely be relied upon to
    allow the drawing of the inference sought by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By failing to adequately consider whether the White
    Truck incident could genuinely be said to show motive, and by failing to
    properly consider the differences in the evidence, the trial judge, in my view,
    overestimated the probative value of the similar facts.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prejudicial Effect of the
    Similar Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the prejudicial effect of the similar
    facts, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The inference which is sought to be drawn by the
    proposed similar fact evidence must relate to an issue at trial which thus
    makes this kind of evidence material.  <i>Any prejudice in this context can only mean
    that there may be an increased chance of conviction</i>.  While it is one thing for this evidence to
    operate unfortunately for the accused, it is quite another to use any evidence
    unfairly or improperly. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read literally, this passage might be interpreted to
    mean that, because the similar fact evidence was material – and therefore
    relevant – the only “prejudice” caused by it would be that it tended to
    implicate the accused. Of course, this position would be wrong; probative
    similar fact evidence may still be highly prejudicial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I do not read this passage as suggesting that
    the trial judge viewed the issue of prejudice this way.  Rather, when read in context, it is apparent that
    the trial judge simply meant that it is not prejudicial, in the sense of moral
    or reasoning prejudice, for the similar fact evidence to implicate the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem, however, is that the trial judge’s reasons
    contain no analysis of the potential for the moral or reasoning prejudice
    identified in <i>Handy</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there was a real risk of both forms of
    prejudice in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the incidents that formed the basis of the
    similar fact application were far less serious than the offence alleged, a risk
    of moral prejudice nonetheless arose as both incidents evidenced bad character
    and reprehensible conduct. The Black Shack Road incident showed the appellant
    to be a person who seeks to inflict serious injury without any provocation or
    cause.  The White Truck incident was
    worse: it demonstrated an actual attack that had gone entirely unpunished.  Presented with this evidence, a fair-minded
    juror might well conclude that the appellant was simply a bad person. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, this was not a case where the similar facts
    themselves were clearly demonstrated.  The witnesses who provided the evidence exhibited serious
    frailties.  Shawn Soney admitted that he
    had little recollection of the Black Shack Road incident independent of his
    police statement.  Clarissa Shipman’s
    evidence was often internally inconsistent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against these shaky accounts, the appellant provided an
    entirely different account of both incidents.  Like the two similar fact witnesses, the appellant’s evidence was
    seriously put into question. The jury was thus left not only with a difficult
    conflict between the evidence of the appellant and Nathaniel Shipman – which
    ought to have been the focus of the trial – but also between the appellant and
    Shawn Soney and Clarissa Shipman respectively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both similar fact incidents gave rise to a strong risk
    of an unfocused and distracted approach to the case.  This, combined with the real risk of moral
    prejudice and the marginal probative value of the evidence, ought to have
    resulted in a ruling that the evidence was inadmissible.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Charge <span class=GramE>To</span> The Jury Compounded The Prejudice Caused By The Admission Of The Similar Fact Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The manner in which the trial judge instructed the jury
    with respect to the similar fact evidence compounded the problematic role that
    this evidence played in the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given Nathaniel Shipman’s admission of complicity in the
    killing of the victim, and his admitted inconsistent statements to both law
    enforcement and the courts, the trial judge quite properly concluded that the
    jury required a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution: see <i>Vetrovec v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1
    S.C.R. 811.  He told the jury that, while
    they were entitled to accept Mr. Shipman’s evidence, common sense indicates
    that they ought to search out confirmatory evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then reviewed the evidence which, in
    his view, might be confirmatory.  Virtually all of this evidence was the similar fact evidence of Shawn
    Soney and Clarissa Shipman.  He pointed to
    what he viewed to be the similarities between the similar facts, and Nathaniel
    Shipman’s account of the night of August 7th.  However, the trial judge made no mention of the <span class=GramE>many
    dissimilarities</span> between the incidents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fairness to the trial judge, later in his charge,
    when instructing the jury on the similar fact evidence itself, he referred to
    both similarities and dissimilarities.  This certainly would have gone some distance in assisting the jury.  However, the manner in which the similar
    facts were linked to the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution remained problematic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I question the extent to which the similar facts
    were capable of supporting the credibility of Nathaniel Shipman.  As I have already stated in these reasons,
    the trial judge overestimated the similarities between the incidents and the
    offence charged.  There was no real
    similarity between <span class=GramE>either similar fact incident and</span> Nathaniel Shipman’s story; no evidence of distinctive conduct described by each
    witness independently from one another.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps more importantly, the trial judge failed to
    bring home to the jury the very serious frailties in the similar fact
    evidence.  He told the jury that, if they
    were not convinced that the similar facts had occurred, they could not rely on
    them.  However, he failed to tell the
    jury why there was reason to be cautious about the evidence of Mr. Soney and
    Ms. Shipman, as he had with respect to Nathaniel Shipman.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the jury were left with a significant body
    of evidence of disreputable conduct, which had marginal probative value and
    questionable reliability, and were told that they could use it to confirm the
    central but problematic evidence of the Crown’s main witness.  In these circumstances, the risk of prejudice
    to the appellant was great.  In that
    regard the Crown quite properly conceded that if the similar fact evidence
    ought not to have been admitted, the proviso (s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>) could not be relied on to
    dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rule against bad character evidence is a long
    standing one, justified by well accepted policy considerations. It is one of
    the central exclusionary rules in the law of evidence designed to ensure that
    an accused’s right to a fair trial is maintained. Similar fact is an exception
    to this exclusionary rule and the case for making such an exception was simply
    not made out on this record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and
