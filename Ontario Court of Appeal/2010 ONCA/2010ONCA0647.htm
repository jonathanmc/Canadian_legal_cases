  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OTHER FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties have two adult children.  In 1992, they opened a Halal meat and
    supermarket in Mississauga.  The
    business, Nader Halal Meat and Supermarket Inc., was originally owned equally
    by the appellant and respondent.  In
    2003, the parties added their two sons as owners so that each member of the
    family owned 25 percent of the business.  There is a substantial dispute about the value of the business.  The appellant claims it was worth $5,000,000
    on valuation day.  The parties also
    acquired an investment property in Toronto in 2003, which is held by a company,
    Tamer Investments Inc.  The parties and
    their sons also held equal shares in this company.  Again there is a dispute about the value of
    the property.  The appellant claims the
    property was purchased for $5,750,000 and that at one time there was a mortgage
    registered on the property in the amount of $3,825,000.    </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 2004</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just before the appellant moved back to Egypt, the
    parties’ son Nader presented her with a document entitled “Divorce Settlement
    Agreement”.  The agreement purports to
    give the respondent exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and the
    appellant agrees to transfer the property into the respondent’s name.  The appellant agrees not to claim “on the
    husband’s bank accounts, matrimonial home …, Nader Halal Meat Inc., or Tamer
    Investment Inc.”.  Under the heading
    “Property” is the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Husband and the Wife accept the terms of this
    agreement in full and final satisfaction and discharge of all claims and
    demands each may, at any time, have against the other pursuant to the Family
    Law Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a similar clause relating to “Support”.  The agreement does not set out anything that
    the appellant received in return for giving up all of her claims.  In her affidavit, the appellant says that she
    received $100,000 U.S. as a lump sum payment for spousal support.  The agreement also sets out under the heading
    “Independent Legal Advice” that the parties have read the agreement, have full
    knowledge of the contents, understand their rights, have made full and complete
    financial disclosure and that the agreement was entered into without undue
    influence, fraud or coercion.  The appellant
    denies that she obtained independent legal advice, that she read the agreement
    or that the respondent made full financial disclosure.  She claims that she does not read English and
    that the document was not translated into Arabic.  The parties did not exchange financial
    information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also claims that she is very intimidated
    by Nader.  She says in her affidavit that
    Nader told her that the agreement simply stated that the respondent was going
    to give her $100,000 U.S. and that she could move back to Egypt.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FINAL AGREEMENT 2008</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says in her affidavit that because of her
    worsening health, she returned to Canada in June 2008.  On this occasion, her other son, Tamer,
    presented her with another document, the Final Agreement.  In her affidavit, the appellant says that Nader
    took her to the offices of a lawyer, Mr. Chhina, in Scarborough.  Mr. Chhina advised her not to sign the
    agreement and to apply for Legal Aid because the agreement was not fair.  She applied for Legal Aid, but was
    refused.  She claims that Nader threatened
    her by saying that if she did not sign she would be homeless and he would turn
    against her.  Nader then took her back to
    the lawyer, who again advised her not to sign.  According to the appellant, Nader and the lawyer argued and Nader told
    him to mind his own business.  Nader then
    told her that if she did not sign the agreement, he would leave her there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant claimed that she had difficulty
    communicating with the lawyer, who did not speak Arabic.  She felt pressured and did not understand what
    she was signing.  The only explanation
    Nader gave her was that the respondent was buying a condominium where she would
    be able to live but which would be in the children’s names.  Nader told her that the condominium was not
    in her name because otherwise the government would seize it because she had not
    paid taxes while she lived in Egypt.  Because of the coercion and statements from Nader, the appellant signed
    the agreement.  However, she wrote in
    Arabic at the bottom of the document: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I will never forgive you, and will never ever
    accept what you have done to me.  Allah
    (Alone) is Sufficient for me, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for
    me).  And you are unjust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the terms of the Final Agreement, under the
    heading: “Equalization of Net Family Property” the parties agree that the
    respondent paid $150,000 Canadian in November 2004 for equalization of net
    family property.  The respondent agreed
    to purchase a condominium for the appellant’s indefinite use but to be
    registered in the names of the children.  The respondent agrees to pay all the fees, taxes and costs associated
    with the condominium and also to pay her medication costs for his life.  The parties agree that those terms are in
    full and final settlement of all claims on the matrimonial home, Nadir Halal
    Meat Inc. and Tamer Investment Inc. “including but not limited to the
    equalization of net family property between the two parties”.  The appellant agrees that she is not entitled
    to any of the equity in the matrimonial home or further equalization
    payments.  She agrees to execute
    documents for the transfer, listing, and sale of the matrimonial home.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant attached an unexecuted copy of the Final
    Agreement to her affidavit.  She says
    that she never received a completed copy.  The respondent attached a completed copy of the Final Agreement to his
    affidavit.  That copy includes an
    affidavit of independent legal advice from Mr. Chhina.  She denies receiving any lump sum payment
    other than the $100,000 U.S. (in November 2004).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was educated in Egypt as an agricultural
    engineer but did not work in Canada.  She
    suffers from epilepsy and relies upon several medications that the respondent
    purchases for her.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>APPELLANT’S KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIVORCE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 2006, while she was in Egypt, the appellant was
    served with a copy of the respondent’s Application for Divorce.  In her affidavit in support of her motion for
    an extension of time, the applicant states that she did not have the financial
    means to obtain Canadian legal advice.  She states that she never received a copy of the final Divorce Order and
    had no knowledge of the divorce until she returned to Canada in June 2008.  She claims that she did not know she had been
    legally divorced until early 2009 when she searched the court records and found
    the Final Divorce Order, which had been issued on October 4, 2006.  She immediately sought legal advice and
    brought the application.  On one of their
    visits to Egypt one of the appellant’s sons gave her a copy of an Islamic
    Declaration of Divorce, dated December 23, 2004.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the motion for summary judgment, the respondent
    states that the two agreements were “to the satisfaction of the applicant and
    her direction”.  He states that her claim
    is statute-barred and that she is bound by the terms of the agreements.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DISCLOSURE IN COURT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the opening of this appeal, counsel for the
    appellant stated that she had just learned that somehow the appellant’s 25
    percent shares in Nader Halal Meat and Supermarket Inc. and Tamer Investment
    Inc. had been sold without her knowledge.  In open court, counsel for the respondent conceded that the Final
    Agreement did not affect the appellant’s interests in those companies.  Counsel for the appellant indicated that she
    would be bringing a separate application respecting the appropriation of her
    shares of the two companies.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE LEGISLATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s claim for equalization of net family
    property is governed by Part I of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>.  Section 5(1) sets out the
    basic rule for division of property upon divorce:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a divorce
    is granted or a marriage is declared a nullity, or when the spouses are
    separated and there is no reasonable prospect that they will resume
    cohabitation, the spouse whose net family property is the lesser of the two net
    family properties is entitled to one-half the difference between them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 7(3) requires that a claim under s. 5 be
    brought within two years of the divorce:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;An application based on subsection 5
    (1) or (2) shall not be brought after the earliest of,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) two years after the day the marriage is
    terminated by divorce or judgment of nullity</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2(8) of the Act, however, gives the court power
    to grant an extension of time to bring the claim:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may, on motion, extend a time
    prescribed by this Act if it is satisfied that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>there</span> are apparent
    grounds for relief;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>relief</span> is unavailable
    because of delay that has been incurred in good faith; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) <span class=GramE>no</span> person will suffer
    substantial prejudice by reason of the delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, one other provision of importance concerns
    domestic contracts such as the two agreements involved in this case.  Section 56(4) of the Act gives the court
    power to set such contracts aside.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;A court may, on application, set
    aside a domestic contract or a provision in it,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<span class=GramE>a</span>) if a party failed to
    disclose to the other significant assets, or significant debts or other
    liabilities, existing when the domestic contract was made;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>if</span> a party did not
    understand the nature or consequences of the domestic contract; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) <span class=GramE>otherwise</span> in
    accordance with the law of contract. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge disposed of the appellant’s claim that
    she did not understand the agreements on the basis that he “must assume that
    counsel who dealt with [the appellant] <i>at
    each stage</i> would or should have taken steps to make sure she understood the
    nature of the proceeding in which she was involved and the documents she signed
    and sworn to in the presence of her legal representatives” [emphasis added].  And further her position “is contrary to the
    certificate of Independent Legal Advice signed by her counsel on July
    2008”.  It is unclear from the motion
    judge’s reasons to whom he is referring besides Mr. Chhina.  There is no evidence in the record that the
    appellant was represented by counsel “at each stage” and in particular in 2004
    when the Divorce Settlement Agreement was signed or in 2006 when the divorce
    was granted.  All the evidence is to the
    contrary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge then dealt with the appellant’s
    motion for an extension of time to bring her application for equalization of
    net family property.  It is not apparent
    that the motions judge expressly dealt with the first condition, apparent
    grounds for relief.  He began his reasons
    respecting the extension of time as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the material filed the applicant has set out her
    reasons why she did not assert her claim within the time.  I am not satisfied, however, that this
    threshold was met.  She acknowledged the
    divorce proceedings were served upon her in 2006.  Then knowing of the pending divorce the
    parties entered their “Final Agreement” which specifically referred to and
    contemplated the parties divorce.  At the
    time I am also satisfied she was represented by counsel and had independent
    legal advice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge then turned to the “second condition
    … whether the delay was incurred in good faith”.  The motions judge relied upon the decision in <i>Ferguson v. Ferguson</i>, [2007] O.J. No.
    390 (Sup. Ct.), which he interpreted as requiring that the appellant establish
    that she had no reason to make inquiries.  The motions judge found that the appellant had every reason to make
    inquiries after she was served with the divorce papers in 2006 and he found
    that “she in fact did take action”.  It
    is unclear what action the motions judge is referring to.  The motions judge then referred to the 2004
    agreement and the 2008 agreement.  With
    respect to the latter, the motions judge found that the appellant “had every
    reason to make inquiries as to her rights, entitlement and status given the
    divorce proceedings of which she was aware”.  The motions judge appeared to accept the appellant’s evidence that she
    only learned of the divorce in 2009, but he held that she should have made
    inquiries when she signed the Final Agreement in July 2008.  He noted that on her own evidence, the
    appellant was unhappy with the terms of the Final Agreement at that time.  He concluded that he had “difficulty in finding
    that she now comes before the court in ‘good faith’”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge then turned to the third condition,
    whether any person will suffer substantial prejudice by reason of the
    delay.  The motions judge referred to <i>Deaville v. Boegemar</i> (1985), 48 O.R.
    (2d) 725 (C.A.) and <i>Basarky v. Quinlan, </i>[1972]
    S.C.R. 390.  He referred to the fact that
    the parties had been separated since 2004 and had entered into two agreements
    and a divorce since then.  He concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Bearing in mind all the facts and circumstances as
    put before me, I cannot find the applicant has established special circumstances
    that necessitate relief to be given to her from the limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge then turned to the motion for summary
    judgment.  He again referred to the
    period of separation, that the parties had two adult children and that both
    parties claimed to be in bad health.  He stated
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the end I cannot find any misrepresentations
    made by the Respondent in the material that led to the final agreement.  The validity and binding nature of the
    “final” 2008 agreement was not challenged until March 2009, some eight months
    after it was signed in June 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it is apparent that the motion for summary
    judgment was granted on the basis that the limitation period had expired.  The motions judge concluded his endorsement
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.  The
    Applicant’s motion for an extension of time is denied.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.  The
    Respondent’s motion for summary judgment that the action is statute barred is
    granted.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Extension of Time</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motions judge erred in law in his
    application of the test under s. 2(8) for whether to grant the appellant an
    extension of time to pursue her claim for equalization of net family
    property.  As indicated, the court may
    extend the time for bringing an application under s. 7(3) where it is satisfied
    that (a) there are apparent grounds for relief; (b) relief is unavailable
    because of delay that has been incurred in good faith; and, (c) no person will
    suffer substantial prejudice by reason of the delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the question of apparent grounds for
    relief.  In my view, the motions judge
    did not properly address this first question.  The only reasons that appear to be directed to this first condition,
    relate to the explanation for the delay, not the merits of her claim for equalization
    of net family property.  The motions
    judge would seem to have made the same error as was identified by this court in <i>Scherer v. Scherer</i> (2002), 59 O.R.
    (3d) 393.  As Charron J.A. pointed out at
    para. 16 of that decision the “relief” under s. 2(8<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    and (b) is “not referable to the extension of time sought by the moving party
    on the motion but to the relief sought on the prescribed claim”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It may be that the motions judge intended to address
    this issue when he came to the question of whether to grant summary judgment to
    the respondent.  As noted, the motions
    judge held that he could not find any misrepresentations made by the respondent
    in the material that led to the Final Agreement.  If so, the motions judge misconceived the
    nature of the appellant’s claim concerning the validity of the Final
    Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to gain access to the provisions of the Act
    respecting equalization of net family property, the appellant would have to set
    aside the 2008 agreement in accordance with s. 56(4) of the Act.  She could do so by showing that the
    respondent had (a) failed to disclose significant debts or assets or other
    liabilities, (b) that she did not understand the nature or consequences of the
    contract, or “c) otherwise in accordance with the law of contract”.  In considering the motion for summary
    judgment, the motions judge considered only misrepresentation by the
    respondent.  The appellant’s claim,
    however, was much broader.  She claimed
    that she signed the Final Agreement under duress.  Her evidence that she was coerced by her sons
    into signing the agreement stands uncontradicted.  If coercion or duress was made out, the
    agreement could be set aside.  That
    issue, which would turn on the credibility of the appellant, the respondent,
    the sons and other witnesses, would have to be determined at trial; it could
    not be determined on a motion for summary judgment.  The motion judge also misapprehended the
    facts in stating that the appellant only challenged the validity and binding
    nature of the Final Agreement in March 2009.  She stated that she would never accept what the respondent had done and
    alleged that the agreement was unjust at the very time she signed it, in her
    endorsement in Arabic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not understand the respondent to suggest that if
    the Final Agreement were set aside there was not a basis for the appellant’s
    claim for equalization of net family property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the 2004 agreement, its terms are manifestly
    unconscionable.  After over 20 years of marriage,
    the appellant appears to give up any claim to the matrimonial home, or to any interest
    in the two companies and received no consideration in return.  She received a relatively modest amount for
    spousal support.  She signed the
    agreement without any independent legal advice.  It is not surprising that the respondent attempted to have the appellant
    enter into another agreement in 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view there are apparent grounds for relief,
    sufficient to meet the first condition under s. 2(8).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also erred in his consideration of the
    second condition, whether the delay had been incurred in good faith.  The motion judge, relying upon <i>Ferguson v. Ferguson</i> held that the
    appellant had to establish that she had no reason to make inquiries.  In <i>Ferguson
    v. Ferguson</i> at para. 15, Tulloch J<span class=GramE>. ,</span> however,
    described good faith as “acting honestly and with no ulterior motive. A state
    of blameless ignorance.”  He also pointed
    out that courts have held that ignorance of the law, with no ulterior motive,
    can in some circumstances amount to good faith provided the applicant also
    establishes that she had no reason to make inquiries.  The appellant, however, did not claim
    ignorance of the law.  Rather, she
    claimed that she was unaware that the divorce had been granted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A more appropriate explanation for the meaning of good
    faith in this context is found in the decision of Mendes da Costa U.F.C.J. in <i>Hart v. Hart</i> (1990), 27 R.F.L. (3d) 419
    at p. 432:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 2(8<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) enshrines
    in legislative form the concept of “good faith”. As is not infrequently the
    case, these words are not defined in the Act, and I do not believe that it
    would be either possible or useful to attempt to catalogue the possibilities
    that they embrace. However, I must attribute to these words their “plain
    meaning according to the understanding and practices of the times.<span
class=GramE>”:</span> <i>Cash v. George
    Dundas Realty Ltd</i>. (1973), 1 O.R. (2d) 241, 248 (C.A.). I believe, to
    establish “good faith”, it must be shown that the moving party acted honestly
    and with no ulterior motive. It does not seem to me that the Legislature,
    anticipating the general newsworthy nature of the family property provisions of
    the Act, intended that a mere failure to make enquiries should necessarily
    negate “good faith”, provided that the absence of enquiry does not constitute
    wilful blindness or does not otherwise, in all the circumstances, fall below
    community expectations. As I have stated, my assessment of the evidence is that
    the wife was ignorant of her rights under the Act, and I believe that her state
    of mind was one of blameless ignorance. I am satisfied that the delay in issue
    was delay incurred in good faith within the meaning of section&nbsp;2(8<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellant has met this test.  Contrary to the finding by the motions judge,
    the appellant did not have legal advice when she signed the Divorce Settlement
    Agreement in 2004.  When she was
    initially served with the divorce application in 2006, she was in Egypt and
    without the financial means to retain counsel.  Her assertion that she did not know about the divorce until 2009 is
    uncontradicted and seems to have been accepted by the motions judge.  She immediately applied for relief under the
    Act.  She brought her claim only four
    months after expiration of the limitation period.  Her affidavit shows that she acted honestly
    and with no ulterior motive.  Perhaps she
    could have made inquiries earlier, but there is no suggestion that her conduct
    amounted to wilful blindness.  In other
    words, there is nothing to suggest that the appellant deliberately failed to
    make inquiries earlier because she suspected that she was not entitled to
    relief. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final condition under s. 2(8) is whether any person
    will suffer substantial prejudice by reason of the delay.  The motions judge did not identify any
    substantial prejudice to the respondent or any other party.  Further, in my view, he erred in requiring
    the appellant to show “special circumstances”.  Special circumstances was a condition imposed where the court was asked
    to exercise its common law power to amend a statement of claim to add a party
    or a claim after a limitation period had expired.  In <i>Deaville
    v. Boegeman, </i>this court accepted that the applicant had to show special
    circumstances where the claim was barred by limitation periods under both the <i>Family Law Reform Act </i>and the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  As the court said at p. 729 :</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fact that there are statutory conditions which,
    if satisfied, provide relief from the limitation periods prescribed by the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> does not, in my
    view, alter or ameliorate the requirement that there be “special circumstances”
    before a claim or party be added after the limitation period has run under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, where the only limitation period that is
    engaged is under the <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    the applicant need only meet the statutory conditions in s. 2(8).  See <i>Hart
    v. Hart</i> at p. 435.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The delay in this case is four months from expiration
    of the limitation period.  The only
    suggestion of prejudice to the respondent is found in this paragraph of his
    affidavit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am sixty-one years of age.  I have suffered from multiple heart attacks
    and had two open-heart surgeries.  I am
    moving on with my life the best I can and am trying to do whatever I can for my
    sons and extended family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was well aware of the case and the
    nature of the claims.  It was his lawyer
    that drafted the Final Agreement only months earlier in an attempt to deprive
    the appellant of her rights to equalization of net family property, support and
    the matrimonial home.  This is the kind
    of case described in <i>Deaville v. Boegeman</i> at p. 730 where “the mere recitation of the facts and history of the case makes
    it clear there is no prejudice to the [respondent] and it can be inferred that
    he knew, within the limitation period, of the case and the nature of the claims
    now being made against him”.  Having to
    deal with this litigation may well cause the respondent some hardship as
    attested to in his affidavit, but, in my view, this is not the kind of
    substantial prejudice envisaged by s. 2(8).  The bald statement that he is moving on with his life and trying to do
    what he can for his sons, men who are adults and own 50 percent of the two
    companies, and his extended family provides no basis for finding that he would
    be substantially prejudiced by a claim brought by his wife of twenty years only
    four months outside the limitation period.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Summary Judgment Motion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge granted summary judgment on the basis
    that the limitation period had expired.  Since I have found that he erred in failing to grant an extension of
    time for the appellant to bring her application, it follows that the order
    granting summary judgment must be set aside.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    order of the motions judge and in its place make an order dismissing the
    respondent’s motion for summary judgment.  I would also grant the appellant’s application for an extension of time
    under s.&nbsp;2(8) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> to bring her claim for equalization of net family property.  Of course, as indicated, the success of any claim
    for equalization of net family property will depend upon the appellant’s
    success in first setting aside the domestic contracts of 2004 and 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties may submit brief written submissions
    concerning costs.  The appellant shall
    provide her submissions within 10 days of release of these reasons.  The respondent shall provide his submissions
    within 10 days of receiving the appellant’s submissions.</p>
