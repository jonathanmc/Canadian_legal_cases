  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 11, 2010 Newbould J. granted judgment against Durable Release
    and Ms.&nbsp;Lund jointly in the amount of approximately $620,000.00 plus
    pre-judgment interest at the rate of 6.3% compounded semi-annually, plus
    costs.  The total of principal and interest now totals approximately
    $1,003,000.00.  The trial judge subsequently fixed costs of $430,000.00, ruling
    that Ms. Lund was jointly responsible for $200,000.00 of that amount. 
    Durable’s counterclaim was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Durable Release and Ms. Lund appealed.  American Axle now moves for an
    order lifting the automatic stay pending appeal with respect to the payment of
    the judgment monies, together with, or in the alternative, an order for
    security for costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lift of stay argument is premised primarily on the central
    characteristic of this case, namely that there has never been any serious
    contest that the principal sum claimed of <span style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>±
    $</span>697,000.00 always belonged to the plaintiff.  The monies comprised GST
    related funds to which parties agreed American Axle (an American Tier 1 auto
    supplier) was entitled and which were collected on its behalf by Durable
    Release.  It is contested whether the trial judge was correct in ordering
    pre-judgment interest at 6.3% instead of at the CJA rate of 3%, and that it be
    payable at a compounded rate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence is that Ms. Lund, the sole shareholder, officer and director
    of Durable Release caused the corporation to pay the GST funds for other
    purposes.  Newbould&nbsp;J. found that there was an agency relationship giving
    rise to a fiduciary relationship between the corporate parties and that those
    obligations were breached and that Ms. Lund was personally liable for having
    “knowingly assisted” Durable Release in the breach of its fiduciary
    obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why should Durable Release and Ms. Lund enjoy the fruits of an automatic
    stay and continue to benefit from the use of the monies admittedly belonging to
    American Axle, Ms.&nbsp;DeMarco argues?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is another wrinkle.  Filed with me today is a Certificate of the
    Superintendent in Bankruptcy indicating that Durable Release has filed a Notice
    of Intention to Make a Proposal under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>. 
    This complicates matters because it raises the issue whether seeking an order
    lifting the stay and ordering security for costs pending Durable’s appeal
    amounts to the seeking of a “remedy” by the creditor, American Axle, which at
    the moment it is barred from, under s. 69(1)(a) of the <i>Bankruptcy and
    Insolvency Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think that little turns on this latter question for today’s purposes,
    however, because whatever happens with respect to Durable Release today is
    somewhat moot.  Even if the stay is lifted, American Axle cannot seek any
    remedy to recover against either the company or its property (s. 69(1)(a)). 
    Durable’s appeal will either lapse or be taken up by the Trustee, or dealt with
    somehow in the Proposal proceeding.  In these circumstances, I make no order
    lifting the stay or granting security for costs against Durable Release.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The real issue is whether an order should issue with respect to Ms. Lund
    personally.  I am satisfied that it should.  In coming to this conclusion I
    have considered both the criteria for a lift of stay reviewed in such cases as <i>Babbitt
    v. Paladin Inc. </i>(1993), 20 C.P.C. (3d) 399, and <i>Hall-Chem Inc. v. Vulcan
    Packaging Inc.</i> (1994), 72 O.A.C. 303 (Ont. C.A.), and <i>Kagal v. Tessler</i>,
    2003 CarswellOnt 6830 at paras. 3 - 4, as well as the principles respecting
    security for costs set out in R. 61.06(1)(c).  The trial judge made significant
    negative findings with respect to Ms. Lund, including remarks about her
    dishonesty and it is clear she is the operating mind of Durable Release and had
    complete knowledge of what was going on.  I am satisfied that all of this gives
    rise to sufficient “other good reason” to order security for costs and
    sufficient basis for the partial lifting stay I propose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The automatic stay is therefore lifted with respect to Ms. Lund to the
    extent of the sum of $620,000.00 representing the principal amount of the claim
    over which there is really no dispute.  In addition, Ms. Lund is to post
    security for costs in the amount of $150,000.00 total for the trial and
    appeal.  The existing bond of $90,000.00 posted by Durable is to remain in
    place.  This is sufficient to secure a significant portion of the trial and
    appeal costs on her part.  If this amount is not paid into court, either by way
    of cash or an acceptable bond, with 45 days of this order, American Axle shall
    be entitled to move for dismissal of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American Axle is entitled to its costs of this motion fixed at $5,000.00
    all inclusive.</p>
