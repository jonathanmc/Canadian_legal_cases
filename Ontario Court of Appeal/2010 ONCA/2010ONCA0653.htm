  <p class=Paragraph1><strong>(2)</strong>            In

  <p class=Paragraph1><strong>(4)</strong>            An

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals his sentence of 5 years on
    a plea to assault and attempted kidnapping. The appellant grabbed a young woman,
    a stranger, off the street in the early hours of the morning and tried to force
    her into his car. He was thwarted because she was able to fight him off and get
    away. When he was stopped later he had in his possession a blindfold, handcuffs,
    a dildo and a machete and had managed to grab the victim’s purse that contained
    underwear and that underwear was stuffed into the front of his pants. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was no joint submission. The Crown
    proposed a sentence – the maximum reformatory sentence, plus time served in
    pre-sentence custody counted on the 2:1 basis of 14 months, plus 3 years
    probation. The trial judge rejected the Crown submission and imposed a 5-year
    penitentiary sentence minus credit for the 14 months time served. She stated
    clearly in her reasons that a reformatory term would be “insufficient to
    address the issues of specific deterrence and denunciation and general
    deterrence and protection of the community given the premeditated random nature
    and aggravating circumstances of this offence”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the trial judge was entitled to
    take the approach she did based on the reasons she gave. She also made no
    reversible error in her treatment of the effect of the guilty plea in all the
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A further factor in this case is the fact that
    following this sentencing the appellant pled guilty to sexual offences
    regarding his step&#8209;daughters and received a sentence of ten years consecutive
    to the 5-year sentence recently imposed, which took into account the totality
    principle with the 5-year sentence. In our view, the sentence of 5 years was a
    fit sentence when imposed and when considered in totality with the subsequent
    10-year sentence. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, leave to appeal sentence is
    granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
