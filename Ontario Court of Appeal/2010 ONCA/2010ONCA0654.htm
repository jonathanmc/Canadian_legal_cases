    pleadings assert that when he was 19 years old, he enrolled at <span
class=SpellE>Glendon</span> Campus at York University for the academic term commencing
    in September 2006. After his application had been accepted, in the summer
    leading up to and during his freshman year there were communications between
    the parties regarding the accommodations Jaffer should receive, but no
    resolution was reached. In April 2007, one of Jaffer’s professors offered
    Jaffer the opportunity to resubmit a paper, and confirmed that he would not be
    giving Jaffer a failed grade but would instead enter a deferred status. That
    paper was submitted in the summer of 2007. Jaffer pleads that he relied upon
    his professor’s statements and understood that his status for all his academic
    courses for the 2006-2007 academic term would be deferred because of the
    ongoing dispute over the failure to accommodate him. He enrolled in courses for
    his second year but was informed that,  because he did not achieve at least a D+ average, his academic status was
    “failed to gain standing, no credit retained”. He was advised that this
    standing meant he could not continue his studies. His relationship with York
    has now ended.   </span></p>

    unjust expulsion from the program. Failure to accommodate belongs to the OHRC,

    during his first academic year he should have obtained a deferred grade

    York failed to follow its own internal policies and procedures. York submits
    that a student has a right of judicial review with respect to procedural
    matters, but the court should not be asked to interfere with a university’s
    decisions or judgments relating to academic matters. York submits that Jaffer
    has attempted to frame his dispute with his professor regarding his paper assignment

    equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without
    discrimination because of “disability”. Education is a service under the Code: <i>Peel Board of Education v. Ontario (Human
    Rights Commission)</i> (1990), 72 O.R. (2d) 593 (Div. Ct.).  The appellant suffered from a “disability” as
    defined under s. 10 of the Code. Section 17 of the Code requires accommodation
    of a disability unless it cannot be provided without undue hardship on the
    person responsible for providing accommodation.  In addition, the OHRC has issued detailed Policies and Guidelines, both
    on Accessible Education and Disability and the Duty to Accommodate.
    Accordingly, the Code, along with the publications of the OHRC, sets out the
    analysis and principles which are applicable when determining whether an
    educational institution has made the appropriate accommodations for a student
    with a disability. The duty to accommodate a disability is a central part of

    contract to which it became a party in accepting the student’s enrolment.<b> </b>By enrolling in the university, the
    student agrees to be subject to the institution’s discretion in resolving
    academic matters, including the assessment of the quality of the student’s work
    and the organization and carrying out of university programs: para. 47.  He also stressed at paras. 47-48 that simply
    asserting that a mark was incorrect or a professor was incompetent will not
    normally be sufficient to establish a cause of action, but that a plaintiff
    must plead specific facts to demonstrate the terms of the contract and how they

    term of the contract between the parties that the university would accommodate

    student’s enrolment.  For example, even
    on a generous reading of the pleadings there is no suggestion that the
    university was aware of any disabilities when it accepted him as a student. In
    fact, the pleadings suggest the opposite – that it was only after Jaffer’s acceptance
    into York that the appellant’s mother “contacted student services to advise
    that [the appellant] was a student with a disability and required
    accommodation”. In oral argument, counsel for Jaffer asserted that York knew or
    ought to have known about Jaffer’s needs for accommodation prior to accepting
    him, as that acceptance was based on his high school record and the IEP formed
    part of that record. This circumstance could support Jaffer’s claim if it was included
    in the pleadings. Moreover, there is no suggestion that York’s policies
    provided for accommodation independently of York’s obligations under the Code
    or that York intended to bind itself to such an obligation. </span></p>

    pleaded upon which to find that accommodation was an express or implied term of
    the contract between the university and Jaffer. Nor is it necessary to imply
    such a term in order to give effect to the agreement. In addition, the appellant
    has not given any detail as to what accommodations he was entitled to pursuant
    to his contract with the university or as to what accommodations he was
    offered. Rather, he simply asserts that the accommodations offered were not
    sufficient or appropriate. Without more, this does not establish a cause of

    dispute over the failure to accommodate him. As a result, he was induced to
