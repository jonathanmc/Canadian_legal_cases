  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted by a jury of first degree
    murder on December 17, 2004.  His
    conviction appeal was dismissed but a verdict of guilty of second degree murder
    was substituted in a judgment rendered by this court on May 26, 2010.  Following the release of this court’s
    judgment, counsel agreed that rather than remit the matter of the period of ineligibility
    for parole to the trial judge, it was appropriate for the panel that heard the
    appeal to deal with that issue pursuant to the powers conferred by s. 686(3)(b)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s position is that the period of ineligibility
    for parole should be fixed at between 12 and 15 years.  The appellant’s position is that the sentence
    be one of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 10 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The factors to be considered are specified in s. 745.4
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, namely, (1) the
    character of the offender, (2) the nature of the offence and the circumstances
    surrounding its commission, and (3) the recommendation, if any, made by the
    jury.  As the appellant was convicted of
    first degree murder the jury made no recommendation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v.
    Shropshire</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, the Supreme Court of Canada stated, at
    para. 27: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]s a general rule, the period of parole
    ineligibility shall be for 10 years, but this can be ousted by a determination
    of the trial judge that, according to the criteria enumerated in s. [744.5],
    the offender should wait a longer period before having his suitability to be
    released into the general public assessed. To this end, an extension of the
    period of parole ineligibility would not be ”unusual”, although it may well be
    that, in the median number of cases, a period of 10 years might still be
    awarded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was 23 years old at the time he committed
    this offence.  He worked as a painter and
    labourer and had fathered three children.  He had a criminal record consisting of 14
    prior convictions, none involving offences of violence and most involving the
    breach of court orders.  The appellant
    had a limited education and a serious history of alcohol and drug abuse.  There was a clear link between the appellant’s
    criminal behaviour and his abuse of alcohol. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has been in custody since his arrest on
    this offence on September 27, 2003.  He
    clearly experienced significant difficulty adjusting to incarceration in the
    penitentiary system but since his placement, first in a Regional Treatment
    Centre following incidents of what he reported as self-inflicted harm, and then
    in a medium security institution, he has made significant progress.  He has improved his educational level, shows
    a good work ethic, and generally has made the necessary adjustments to life in
    a custodial setting where he has been able to benefit from rehabilitative
    programmes. While there have been disciplinary incidents, including one in 2008
    involving alcohol, the appellant, now 30 years old, presents as a very
    different individual than the 23-year-old man who committed this crime.  He enjoys significant support from his family
    and the mother of two of his children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts surrounding the murder are fully set out in
    our reasons for judgment on the conviction appeal.  We rejected the appellant’s argument that the
    conviction for first degree murder was unreasonable but we also concluded, at
    paragraph 68, “a verdict of first degree murder was only barely attainable on
    the facts of this case, thereby highlighting the importance of an appropriate
    instruction from the trial judge.”  We
    concluded that the jury had not been properly instructed with respect to first degree
    murder.  While this would ordinarily have
    led to a new trial, the Crown took the position that in the event we found
    errors relating to the jury instructions on first degree <span class=GramE>murder,</span> the appropriate remedy was to substitute a verdict of guilty of second degree
    murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the victim impact statements show, this crime had a
    devastating effect upon the victim’s family who suffered the horrible loss of a
    19-year-old young man of warmth, good humour, and enormous promise and
    potential.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant continues to maintain that he acted in
    self-defence but, in an affidavit filed on this appeal and during his cross
    examination on that affidavit before this court, the appellant expressed
    remorse for the pain and suffering his conduct caused the friends and family of
    the victim.  We recognize that, as the Crown
    pointed out, this expression of remorse and apology comes very late in the day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We recognize as well that while the appellant’s recent
    institutional history offers the hope of rehabilitation and the possibility of
    his eventual successful integration into the community, rehabilitation remains
    a hope, not a certainty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, we must sentence the appellant on the basis
    of the current state of affairs rather than that which existed at the time of
    this offence and the time the jury convicted him.  At the end of the day there is not a great
    deal of difference in the positions taken by the Crown and the appellant as to
    the appropriate period of parole ineligibilty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant that the two cases that
    offer the most guidance in these circumstances are <i>R. v. Maciel</i> (2007), 226 O.A.C. 1, and <i>R. v. Pyne</i> (1997), 104 O.A.C. 225. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Maciel</i>, as
    in this case, this court sentenced the offender after a successful appeal from
    a conviction for first degree murder and after a significant period of time had
    elapsed from the time of the offence.  <i>Maciel</i> involved an offender who had shot
    his victim in the back and then six more times at a prearranged meeting to
    settle a dispute over a drug deal.  The
    appellant was described as a lawless, violent person who followed a criminal
    lifestyle and demonstrated a willingness to use firearms to further his
    criminal purposes.  The offender had made
    significant progress after almost eight years in custody and enjoyed the support
    of his wife and family.  This court
    imposed a parole ineligibility of 12 years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of <span class=SpellE><i>Pyne</i></span> appear to be quite similar to the facts of the present
    case.  The appellant had stabbed his
    victim several times in retaliation for an earlier attack by the victim.  The trial judge had imposed a 12 year period
    of parole ineligibility.  By the time of
    the appeal, the appellant was making good progress in custody.  This court dismissed the conviction appeal but
    allowed the sentence appeal and reduced the period of parole ineligibility to one
    of 10 years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view the circumstances of this offence are less
    aggravating than the circumstances of <i>Maciel</i> where <span class=GramE>a 12</span> year parole ineligibility was imposed, and closer
    to the circumstances in <i>Pyne</i> where a
    10 year period was found to be appropriate.  Another factor distinguishing this case from <span
class=SpellE><i>Maciel</i></span> is that
    the appellant has committed no other violent offences and had not adopted a
    criminal lifestyle when he committed this offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking all the relevant factors into account, including
    the character of the offender, the nature of the offence, and the jurisprudence,
    we conclude that the appropriate sentence is one of life imprisonment with a 10
    year period of ineligibility for parole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this case, like <i>Pyne</i>, is one where it is appropriate to follow the “general rule”
    of a 10 year period of parole ineligibility mentioned by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Shropshire</i>.  We point out that the sentence is one of life
    imprisonment and that the issue of when, if ever, the appellant has made
    sufficient progress to be considered an appropriate candidate for parole is in
    the hands of the Parole Board. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the submission of the Crown that there
    should be a lifetime weapons prohibition pursuant to s. 109 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and a DNA order pursuant
    to section 487.051.  As directed by s.
    745.01, we specify that the appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment and is
    not eligible for parole until September 27, 2013, a period of 10 years from the
    date of incarceration for the offence. </p>
