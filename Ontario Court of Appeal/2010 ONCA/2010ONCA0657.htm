  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Can
    an employer take contribution holidays?  Withdraw
    surplus funds from the pension plan?  In
    the past two decades, the courts have wrestled with these questions in the
    context of private sector pension plans.  The present appeals raise those same questions with one significant
    difference:  the employer is the
    Government of Canada (the Government).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Unions
    and associations representing federal government employees, the RCMP and
    Canadian Forces personnel (the appellants) brought actions against the
    Government in which they effectively sought an order requiring the Government
    to return over $28 billion to their pension plans.  They alleged that the money had been
    improperly taken by way of contribution holidays and/or withdrawal of surplus.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    trial judge heard the actions together.  He dismissed the claims.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>On
    appeal, this court is asked to reverse the trial decision and order the
    Government to repay the monies it withdrew, at least to the extent of the
    employees’ contributions plus the interest that was credited on those
    contributions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>For

    Accounts disclosed that the amounts credited to the Superannuation Accounts exceeded
    the actuarial liabilities of the Plans; that is, the Public Accounts showed
    that there was an actuarial surplus in the Superannuation Accounts.  The surplus arose as a result of a
    combination of factors, including low inflation rates, high interest rates,
    Government-imposed restraints on salaries, the capping of indexing benefits in
    the 1980s, and changing assumptions in calculating the actuarial liability of
    the Plans.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the 1990-91 fiscal year, the Government began to “amortize”
    the actuarial surplus in the Superannuation Accounts.  During the 1990s, the Government amortized a
    total of $18.6 billion, with further amounts being amortized after the year
    2000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amount amortized each year was recorded in a
    separate account known as the Estimate of Pension Adjustments.  The amortized amount was “booked” into the
    fiscal framework and applied to effectively reduce the annual pension expense of
    the Government, as disclosed in the Statement of Revenues and Expenses.  The amortized amount also reduced the liability
    disclosed in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the Superannuation
    Accounts, thus reducing the Government’s annual budget deficit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amortization of these amounts did not affect the

    be done in accordance with the requirements of the <i>Superannuation Acts</i>, as I have explained, the Government made use
    of the surplus assets by means of amortization, applying a portion of the
    surplus to offset its annual pension expense.    </p>

    of actuarial surplus.  The appellants
    claimed that they had an equitable interest in the Superannuation Accounts, at

    they submitted that it was improper for the Government to have amortized the
    surplus during those years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second broad claim related to Bill C-78.  Between 2001 and 2004, the Government
    withdrew slightly over $28 billion from the Superannuation Accounts.  The appellants claimed that Bill C-78 did not
    authorize the Government to withdraw that money.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellants claimed that Bill C-78 violated
    their equality rights under the <i>Charter</i>.  No appeal has been taken from the trial judge’s
    rejection of this claim.  Consequently,
    no more will be said about this claim.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Government contended that the Superannuation
    Accounts do not hold assets capable of being the subject of legal or equitable
    interests and that, in any event, plan members have no legal or equitable
    interest in the amounts in the Superannuation Accounts.  It argued that even if plan members did have
    such interests, those interests were validly extinguished by Bill C-78. On its
    interpretation of Bill C-78, the Government is authorized to debit surplus amounts
    in the Superannuation Accounts.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'><span> </span></span>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed the appellants’ claims.  He held that the members of the Plans have no
    interest in the Superannuation Accounts.  In reaching this conclusion, he found that there could have been no
    breach of trust on the Government’s part because the amounts recorded in the
    Superannuation Accounts were not trust funds.  In that regard, he determined that the legislation contained no intent
    to establish a trust and that there was no certainty of subject matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further held that the <i>PSSA </i>was a complete code, in that it set
    out all of the rights and obligations of the Government and plan members.  Accordingly, he concluded that the Government
    had no scope to exercise discretion and, therefore, it was not a
    fiduciary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge found that the Government had
    complied with all of its duties under the <i>PSSA </i>and that there had been no breach of duty in amortizing the surplus.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that Bill C-78 authorized the
    Government to remove surplus from the Superannuation Accounts.  As he had concluded that the plan members had
    no legal or equitable interest that had been breached by the Government’s amortization
    of surplus in the Superannuation Accounts, he found that Bill C-78 did not
    expropriate such interests.  However, he
    went on to hold that even if the plan members did have an interest in the
    surplus, Bill C-78 gave the Government the discretion to debit surplus from the
    Superannuation Accounts.     </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The

    give proper consideration to the language of the various statutes, the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The

    the amounts in the Superannuation Accounts are referred to as “assets”.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span

'>[28]</span></span></span></a>  Nonetheless, it is clear that the
    Superannuation Accounts do not hold assets and the sloppy use of language
    cannot change that reality.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
    essence, the Superannuation Accounts are legislated ledgers.  Among other things, the Superannuation
    Accounts are designed to: (1) record the amounts to be credited to the Plans,
    including the contributions of employees and the Government; and (2) set out an
    estimate of the Government’s liability to provide the benefits promised by the
    Plans.  The information contained in the
    Superannuation Accounts is necessary for a number of reasons, including
    monitoring and reporting.  However, it
    remains that the amounts shown in the Superannuation Accounts are only
    information or bookkeeping entries.      </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I appreciate that it is counterintuitive to find that
    there are no assets in the Superannuation Accounts.  After all, money is deducted from employees’
    pay cheques each month as contributions towards their pensions.  That is real money.  If it had not been deducted from their pay
    cheques, that money would have gone into the employees’ hands.  So where did the money go, if not into the
    Superannuation Accounts?   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The answer is that the money went into the CRF.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[29]</span></span></span></a>  The amount of the employees’ contributions was
    then recorded as a credit in the appropriate Superannuation Account.  Real money (<i>i.e</i>. the employee contributions) went into the CRF and real money
    was paid out of the CRF for pensions.  However, it is only the amount of the contributions and the cost of the pension
    obligations that are reflected in the Superannuation Accounts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of the CRF, employee contributions form part of
    the aggregate of all public monies.  Once
    monies become part of the CRF, they are public monies to be used by the
    Government for public purposes.  As such,
    the Plans are very unlike private sector pension plans, in which pension monies
    are generally held in trust or as segregated pools of funds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The </span>various
    reasons why funds in private sector pension plans are held in trust do not
    apply when the Government is the employer.  For example, private sector plans are funded to avoid the risk that
    there will be insufficient funds to provide the promised benefits if the
    employer becomes insolvent or has financial difficulties.  That risk does not exist for these Plans –
    the Government will not cease to exist nor will it become unable to meet its
    pension obligations.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept the appellants’ argument that there
    must be assets in the Superannuation Accounts because the pensions are
    regularly said to be “fully funded”.  Understood in context, that phrase simply means that the value of credited
    contributions in the Superannuation Accounts is sufficient to fully discharge the
    Government’s liability for all promised pension benefits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I accept that the classification of the
    Superannuation Accounts as “Specified Purpose Accounts” in the Public Accounts
    proves that the Superannuation Accounts were funded.  The description of the Accounts as “Specified
    Purpose Accounts” is no more than an accounting classification.  The classification is referred to only in
    Government Policy circulars and was not introduced into accounting policy until
    1980-81, long after the Superannuation Accounts were established in the CRF by
    statute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    the trial judge’s finding that there were no assets in the Superannuation
    Accounts is not in conflict with the expert evidence given at trial.  The experts acknowledged that there was no

    judge was entitled to reject the experts’ theory that the Government borrowed
    from the Superannuation Accounts the difference between the contributions plus
    interest and the pension obligations and then owed the borrowed amounts to the
    Superannuation Accounts.  On this theory,
    the Government owes a debt to the Superannuation Accounts and the primary asset
    of each account is a receivable from the Government.  As the trial judge stated, there was no such
    borrowing, no debt owing and no assets in the Superannuation Accounts.     </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants rely on the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    recent decision in <i>Ermineskin Indian Band
    and Nation v. Canada</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 222 for the general proposition that
    funds held in the CRF on behalf of a particular group are, in fact, borrowed by

    had been necessary for the bands to surrender their interests in the reserves
    to the Crown so that the Crown could enter into arrangements with third parties
    to exploit the resources.  The statutory

    royalties, involved the <i>Indian Act</i>,<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The bands
    alleged that the Crown’s fiduciary obligations required it to invest the

    failure to invest in that fashion deprived them of hundreds of millions of
    dollars.  Their claims were dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court held that the relationship between

    the royalties in the CRF and, although the Crown borrowed the bands’ money from
    the CRF, the borrowing was required by legislation.  The Court reiterated that a fiduciary acting in
    accordance with legislation cannot be said to be in breach of its fiduciary

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    contrary to the appellants’ submission, Bill C-78 does not support the contention

    the same private law rights as other employees.  Consequently, they say, the Government owes its employees the same
    obligations as those of a private sector employer, unless those obligations are
    specifically superceded by statute.  The

    certain rights and obligations on the parties, those rights and obligations are
    supplemented by the rights and obligations established by the common law and in

    penalties for early retirement and the responsibility of the Government to
    credit interest and make actuarial liability credits.  Thus, the respondent contends, there is no
    scope within the legislative scheme for plan members to have equitable rights.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In my

    question raised by this litigation is what powers and obligations the
    Government had in respect of the actuarial surplus.  As prior to the enactment of Bill C-78 the <i>PSSA </i>did not deal with the parties’
    rights and obligations in that regard, it cannot be said to have been a
    complete code.  A comparison of this case
    with <i>Gladstone v. Canada (A.G.</i>),

    addition to that which was set out in the legislation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Gladstone</i>, the statutory scheme dealt
    completely and exhaustively with the return of seized property.  In the present case, however, the rights and
    obligations of the parties in respect of the amounts in the Superannuation
    Accounts are not fully dealt with.  The <i>PSSA </i>established how amounts were to be
    credited to the Superannuation Accounts, based on credits for contributions by
    the Government and employees.  It dealt
    with the situation of an actuarial deficit, that is, where the pension
    liabilities exceeded the pension credits, by requiring the Government to make
    additional credits to the Superannuation Accounts.   But it did not deal with the situation of an
    actuarial surplus, where the amounts credited to the Superannuation Accounts were
    greater than the pension liabilities.  When
    an actuarial surplus arose, what rights and obligations did the parties
    have?  The <i>PSSA </i>was silent on that matter, prior to Bill C-78.  Consequently, as I have said, it could not

    a complete code?  The appellants assert
    that there are two consequences to this determination.  First, they say that the plan members’
    equitable rights must prevail in respect of the actuarial surplus.  Second, they maintain that as the <i>PSSA </i>did not codify the Government’s
    rights and obligations in respect of the actuarial surplus, the Government was
    under a fiduciary duty when it dealt with it.  The second alleged consequence is discussed in Section VII, below, so no

    rights in the actuarial surplus.  Under

    certain specified pension benefits.  There is no language in the <i>PSSA </i>akin
    to that found in many private sector plans to the effect that all amounts
    contributed to the pension plan are done so “irrevocably to the benefit” of the
    plan members.  In fact, there is nothing
    in the <i>PSSA </i>to suggest that the plan
    members are entitled to anything more than their promised pension
    benefits.  Moreover, and very
    importantly, there were no segregated funds, there was no trust and, as

    could not have superceded whatever rights the employees may have had in
    relation to it.  Based on <i>Wells </i>and in the absence of assets in
    the Superannuation Accounts, contract principles must be applied to determine those
    rights.  On that basis, the plan members’

    duty.  They say that the Government was a
    fiduciary and, therefore, obliged to use the amounts in the Superannuation Accounts
    (at least to the extent of the members’ contributions and interest thereon) for
    the purpose for which they were contributed, namely, the provision of pension
    benefits to plan members.  Such benefits
    could take the form of benefit increases, contribution decreases or protection
    against future contribution increases.  Amortizing
    and later removing the surplus from the Superannuation Accounts had the effect
    of rendering the surplus unavailable for use in a manner that would benefit
    plan members.  These acts, the appellants

    explain later in these reasons, Bill C-78 authorizes the Government to withdraw
    surplus from the Superannuation Accounts.  Thus, even if the Government was a fiduciary when it withdrew the

    the trial judge, in my view, the Government had the scope for the exercise of
    power or discretion in this case.  The
    fact that the Government met its obligations under the <i>PSSA</i> overlooks the discretion that the Government exercised in
    managing the credited amounts in the Superannuation Accounts.  The Government was under no obligation to
    deal with the actuarial surplus.  Rather,
    the Government made the decision to deal with the actuarial surplus by
    amortizing it.  In my view, that amounts
    to the exercise of discretion (the Discretion).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>But,
    the question becomes, was the Discretion exercised over property of the plan
    members?  Plan members have a proprietary
    interest in the money deducted from their pay cheques, which form their contributions
    to the pension plans.  The appellants
    argue that, at the very least, the Government had control over those
    contributions and, thus, over property belonging to the plan members.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>This contention
    is not borne out factually.  Employee
    contributions were deposited into the CRF.  At that point, the contributions became public funds.  As explained above, there was no body of
    assets – that is, no property belonging to the plan members – that was affected
    by the exercise of the Discretion.  When
    the Government amortized the surplus, it recorded the amount that was amortized
    in a separate account known as the Estimate of Pension Adjustments.  The amortized amount was then booked into the
    fiscal framework and applied to effectively reduce the Government’s annual
    pension expense.  The liability disclosed
    in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the Superannuation Accounts was
    also reduced, thereby reducing the Government’s annual budget deficit.  In short, amortization of the actuarial
    surplus was a series of ledger entries that altered the amount of actuarial surplus
    but did not actually affect property.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    the latter two factors for a fiduciary relationship are present in this case,
    the first is not.  Consequently, I
    conclude that the Government was not under a fiduciary duty when it exercised
    the Discretion.  Two additional
    considerations fortify this conclusion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    common law factors set out above are not determinative of whether a fiduciary
    relationship exists.  They provide
    assistance in deciding that question.  At
    its core, a fiduciary relationship arises where, given all the surrounding
    circumstances, one party could reasonably have expected that another would act in
    the former’s best interests:  see <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, at pp. 409-10.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In the
    circumstances of these appeals, I do not view it as reasonable for the members
    of the Plans to have expected the Government to act in their best interests
    when exercising the Discretion.  There </span>is
    nothing in the language of the<i> Superannuation Acts </i>(or other legislation affecting the Plans and the
    exercise of the Discretion) that requires the Government to act solely for the
    benefit, or in the best interests, of the members of the Plans.  By way of contrast, Parliament makes it clear
    in s. 4(1)(a) of Bill C-78 that amounts transferred to it must be managed in
    the “best interests of the contributors and beneficiaries” under the <i>Superannuation Acts</i>.  Nor did the Government enter into any type of
    agreement or undertaking to the effect that it would act solely for, or in the
    best interests of, plan members.  Certainly
    the employment relationship between the Government and the plan members does
    not give rise to such an obligation.      <span> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    a fiduciary relationship is unlikely to exist where it would place the Crown in
    a conflict between its responsibility to act in the public interest and its
    obligation to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries:  see <i>Harris
    v. Canada</i>, [2002]  2 F.C. 484 (T.D.),
    at para. 178, relying on <i>Fairford First
    Nation v. Canada (A.G.)</i>, [1999] 2 F.C. 48 T.D.), at para. 67.  The Government was in just such a situation
    when it amortized the actuarial surplus and thereby reduced the annual
    deficit.  If the Government were held to

    Parliament an actuarial report containing “an estimate of the extent to which <i>the assets of the said Account </i>are
    sufficient to meet the cost of benefits payable under the Act” (emphasis added)
    ; s. 45 of the <i>PSSA</i>, which requires
    “an actuarial valuation report and <i>an
    assets report on the state of each of the Superannuation Accounts” </i>to be
    filed with the Minister (emphasis added); and ss. 8-9 of the <i>Public Pensions Reporting Act </i>which

    Superannuation Account for what was then the civil service superannuation plan
    was first established by regulation in 1925 under the <i>Civil Service Superannuation Act</i>, S.C. 1924, c. 69: Order in
    Council, P.C. 56-436, dated March 24, 1925.  By amendment to s. 12 of that Act in 1944, the Superannuation Account
    was statutorily established as a Special Account in the CRF to account for
    monies received and payable under the Act: S.C. 1944-45, c. 34, s. 6.  The Act also provided, in s. 12, that monies
    received under the Act formed part of the CRF and monies payable thereunder
    were to be paid out of the CRF.  These
    provisions were re-enacted as s. 21 of the <i>Civil
    Service Superannuation Act</i>, R.S.C. 1952, c. 50.  The contents of this footnote are taken from
    para. 42 of the Agreed Statement of Facts filed in these appeals.</p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[30]</span></span></span></a> The
    appellants’ accounting expert, Mr. Milne, acknowledged in cross-examination
    that there is no separate pool of assets that could be liquidated to pay
    pensions because the Superannuation Accounts consist of bookkeeping entries and
    that the interest credited to the Superannuation Accounts was simulated or
    notional.  He stated that if the Plans
    were terminated today, there were no tangible assets that could be liquidated
    to satisfy the obligations under the <i>Superannuation
    Acts</i>.  Instead, those obligations
    would be paid out of the CRF.  See
    cross-examination of Scott Milne, TT, vol. 8, pp. 73-77.  The evidence of the appellants’ actuarial
    expert, Mr. Christie, reinforced the conclusion that the Superannuation
    Accounts did not contain assets.  See
    cross-examination of John Christie, TT, vol. 5, pp. 62-63.</p>
