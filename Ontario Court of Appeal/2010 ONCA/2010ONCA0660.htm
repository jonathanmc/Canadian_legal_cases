    trial of one count of possession of child pornography and one count of
    accessing child pornography.  The Crown
    appealed the acquittal on the possession count and the summary conviction
    appeal court judge allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.  The appellant seeks leave to appeal to this
    court and, if leave is granted, asks that the acquittal be restored. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant took his computer to a repair shop.  The appellant did not reveal his password or
    authorize the repairer to examine any files on the computer as that was not
    required to do the repair.  However, the
    repairer bypassed the password and saw a large number of picture icons on the
    desktop of the computer screen.  The
    repairer opened some of the icons and found depictions of child pornography.  The police were called, the appellant was
    arrested and, shortly after his arrest, he made an incriminating statement to
    the police effectively admitting knowledge of the pictures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the statement had been made
    in violation of the appellants’ <i>Charter</i> rights and that the Crown had failed to establish the voluntariness of the
    statement.  The statement was accordingly
    excluded.  The trial judge found that the
    appellant’s physical control of the computer did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the appellant possessed the child pornography. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal court judge ruled that
    the trial judge had erred by excluding the appellant’s statement to the police
    and by failing to infer knowledge of the pictures.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the summary conviction
    appeal court judge erred in law both by reversing the trial judge’s ruling on
    the admissibility of his statement and by, in effect, retrying the case without
    according appropriate deference to the factual findings of the trial judge.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.  Leave to appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R. v. R.R.</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), holds that leave to appeal may be granted in
    two types of cases:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%'>1. Where there is an arguable question of
    law that has significance to the administration of justice beyond the four
    corners of the case; and </p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%'>2. Where there appears to be a “clear”
    error, even if it cannot be said that the error has significance to the
    administration of justice beyond the specific case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the respondent Crown that as the summary
    conviction appeal court judge based his conclusion upon what he considered to
    be errors of law rather than the verdict of acquittal being unreasonable, it is
    not necessary for this court to address the legal issue of whether the Crown is
    entitled to appeal an unreasonable verdict in the context of a summary
    conviction appeal: see <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>,
    [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381; <i>R. v. Kendall</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 565 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No.
    387.  Accordingly, we would not grant
    leave under the first branch of the <i>R.R.</i> test. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, we agree with the appellant that leave should
    be granted under the second branch of <i>R.R.</i>  As we will explain in greater detail
    below, there appear to us to be clear errors on the part of the summary
    conviction appeal court judge, and as those errors led that judge to set aside an
    acquittal on a serious charge involving not only moral opprobrium but also a
    significant risk of imprisonment, it is in the interests of justice for this
    court to entertain the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.
    Admissibility of the appellant’s statement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s mother, a high school teacher of 33
    years’ experience, testified on the <i>voir
    dire</i> that the appellant had been identified as a special needs child in
    grade 1 and that he had disabilities in reading, writing and comprehension.  His cognitive skills are below average and
    while he had managed to graduate from high school, he did not always “hear” or
    grasp everything that was said to him, particularly when under stress. The Crown
    did not object to this evidence at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge said the following with respect to her
    evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mrs. Elizabeth Panko testified as to her son’s
    difficulties in comprehension. Her testimony is clearly that of a parent with
    an interest in practical terms in the outcome of this proceeding. <i>I did not qualify her as an expert, but </i>I
    did permit [her] to testify as to her personal knowledge of her son during his
    life with her. I also find that she has the experience and training in the
    public school system to provide me with <span class=GramE>a with</span> the
    history of his difficulties in school. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I accept her testimony for those insights. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that on the basis of the
    police description of the appellant and their interaction with him, “coupled
    with the testimony of Mrs. Panko”, there was more than a reasonable likelihood
    that the appellant’s admissions to the officer “were not informed by an
    understanding of his right to remain silent or of how his admissions could be
    used in a legal proceeding.”  The trial
    judge was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s
    admissions to the police were voluntary.  The trial judge explained that there were
    readily apparent “objective indicia” that the appellant might have difficulties
    in comprehension, including his unusual appearance and attire and the
    disorderly state of the interior of his car.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal court judge found that
    the trial judge had relied heavily on the mother’s evidence and that he erred
    in doing so because, as the summary conviction appeal court judge put it, “her
    evidence as to what her son would understand at the time of his arrest was
    speculative and opinion evidence that should not have been acted on.”  He concluded that once her evidence was taken
    off the table, the trial judge’s conclusion as to voluntariness had to be set
    aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While certain passages from the mother’s evidence could
    be read as expressing an opinion about what her son would have understood upon
    arrest, in our respectful view, the summary conviction appeal court judge
    misapprehended the use to which the trial judge had put the mother’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the paragraph quoted above from the
    trial judge’s reasons that the trial judge recognized the limitations of the
    mother’s evidence, and in particular, that he recognized that he could not use
    it as opinion evidence as to what the appellant understood at the relevant
    time.  The trial judge did not err in law
    by holding that he could use her evidence for the insights provided into the
    appellant’s mental limitations and difficulties and by taking that into account
    when assessing the voluntariness of the statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge’s findings with respect to the admissibility
    of the appellant’s statement appear to us to be generous, we do not agree that
    his findings were tainted with the legal error identified by the summary
    conviction appeal court judge.  The trial
    judge was aware of the limitations of the mother’s evidence and aware that it
    did not amount to expert opinion evidence, and he was entitled to use her
    evidence as to the fact of the appellant’s disability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the issue of the admissibility of the statement can
    be disposed of on the voluntariness point, we need not deal with the <i>Charter</i> issues. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3. Reversal of the acquittal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s statement was a significant part of the
    Crown’s case and the summary conviction appeal court judge’s conclusion that
    the trial judge had erred by excluding the statement formed an important
    element in his conclusion that the acquittal should be set aside.  As we disagree with the summary conviction
    appeal court judge’s assessment of the statement issue, the case for setting
    aside the conviction is significantly weakened. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in our respectful view, the summary
    conviction appeal court judge erred by failing to accord the appropriate level
    of deference to the trial judge’s conclusion that the Crown had failed to prove
    the case beyond a reasonable doubt.  The
    trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s knowledge of the child
    pornography could not be inferred in the circumstances, like his finding that
    the statement was not voluntary, appears to us be a generous finding in favour
    of the appellant.  However, it is
    well-established that absent legal error, factual findings made by trial
    judges, even findings that would not be made by the judge called upon to decide
    an appeal, are entitled to significant deference on appeal.  That principle, frequently applied in the
    context of conviction appeals, has added force where the Crown appeals an
    acquittal resting upon a trial judge’s conclusion that the evidence is not
    sufficient to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.  This follows from the very nature of the
    concept of reasonable doubt, which<span style='color:black'> rests upon a
    nuanced judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence rather than on the
    foundation of factual findings that is required to support a conviction</span>:
    see <i>R. v. Walker</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 245
    at para. 26.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge explained why he felt that the Crown’s
    evidence failed to prove criminal knowledge and control to the criminal
    standard of proof and we do not agree that his reasons reveal any error of law
    that could justify an appellate court in reversing the acquittal. In effect,
    the summary conviction appeal court judge retried the case.  He identified certain evidence that he thought
    should have led the trial judge to infer guilty knowledge.  While it is certainly the case that the trial
    judge <i>could have</i> inferred guilty
    knowledge from that evidence, the trial judge was not <i>required</i> to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with the summary conviction appeal
    court judge that the trial judge <span class=GramE>overlooked,</span> disregarded or misapprehended relevant evidence.  It is clear from the record that the trial
    judge actually viewed the computer, the desktop, and the 91 icons. His detailed
    reasons indicate that he was fully aware of the relevant evidence and that he
    took it into account when deciding the case.  Like the summary conviction appeal court
    judge, we might well have come to a different conclusion on this evidence.  However, it was the trial judge who heard the
    evidence and saw the witnesses and it was for him, not the summary conviction
    appeal court judge, to make the call. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the trial judge erred in law by
    admitting or considering the evidence of a police officer that material can
    make its way on to a computer in various ways, not all of which are known to or
    in the control of the owner.  While it is
    true that the officer was not qualified as an expert, he was called by the Crown
    and he gave extensive technical evidence about the storage of digital images on
    computers.  He explained the software
    that was used to examine the appellant’s computer, what was found, and
    where.  The impugned evidence was given
    in answer to questions posed by the trial judge.  The only reference to opinion evidence came
    when the officer stated that he could not offer any opinion on whether someone
    had accessed the appellant’s computer from a remote location. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, we do not agree that the trial
    judge erred in law by relying on his evidence in concluding that there was at
    least a possibility that the offensive images could have been put on the
    appellant’s computer without his knowledge.  The issue of the officer’s expertise was not
    raised at trial, either by the Crown or by the appellant’s counsel.  If the officer was not qualified to give the
    technical evidence that assisted the appellant, then we fail to see how he was
    qualified to give the technical evidence that favoured the Crown. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal, allow the
    appeal, set aside the order of the summary conviction appeal court judge, and
    restore the acquittal.</p>
