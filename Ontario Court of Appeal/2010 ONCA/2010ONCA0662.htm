  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted, following a trial before <span
class=SpellE>McIsaac</span> J. and a jury, of one count of sexual assault under
    s. 271 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and three
    counts of various drug offences under the <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i>. He appeals these convictions. He also appeals the
    three-year custodial sentence he received for these offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his conviction appeal, the appellant&#8217;s first
    ground of appeal is that the trial judge improperly denied his application to
    sever the <i>Criminal Code</i> and <i>CDSA</i> offences, which may have resulted
    in improper propensity reasoning by the jury. In particular, the appellant
    contends that the trial judge did not give sufficient weight to the
    appellant&#8217;s stated intention of testifying on the <i>Criminal Code</i> charge but probably not testifying on the <i>CDSA</i> charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. Although the trial
    judge made his ruling before the Supreme Court of Canada delivered its most
    recent decision relating to severance of counts in an indictment, <i>R. v. Last</i>, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 146, in our
    view his analysis was consistent with the framework set out in <i>Last</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that there was a close nexus
    between the event (in a period of less than 24 hours) grounding the <i>Criminal Code</i> and <i>CDSA</i> charges. He did not regard the joint trial of the four
    offences as leading to undue complexity. He was concerned that <span
class=GramE>a young, vulnerable complainant (on the sexual assault charge)
    testify</span>, if possible, only once. He also specifically addressed
    potential prejudice to the appellant. In all of this, in our view, the trial
    judge&#8217;s identification and balancing of the relevant factors was
    appropriate and in line with the existing case law and, in an anticipatory
    sense, with <i>Last</i>. There is a high
    degree of deference to a trial judge&#8217;s ruling in this domain and the
    trial judge is entitled to that deference in this case: See <i>Last</i> and <i>R. v. Litchfield</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333. Finally, we note that the
    appellant makes no objection to the trial judge&#8217;s charge to the jury on
    the issue of the danger of cross-pollination on credibility assessments and
    propensity reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant&#8217;s second ground of appeal is that
    the trial judge permitted improper confidential informer hearsay evidence to be
    admitted and that he compounded this mistake by referring to it in his jury
    charge. The information about which the appellant was concerned was information
    that a confidential source had provided to the police that established a link
    between the appellant, his car and a house in Barrie that the police were
    investigating concerning illegal drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. To start, we doubt that the testimony of
    the two police officers of concern to the appellant was, as they expressed it,
    even hearsay. In any event, that information came out first hand from the
    testimony of the complainant (before the police officers&#8217; testimony) and
    the appellant himself (in his later testimony). In short, there was no mystery about
    the possible connection between the appellant and the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the jury charge, in light of the trial
    judge&#8217;s earlier warnings to counsel about this evidence, it is
    unfortunate that he appears to have breached his own warning in his jury charge
    by referring to the appellant as &#8220;a target&#8221; of the investigation.
    That said<span class=GramE>,</span> we do not believe that the trial
    judge&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;target&#8221; constitutes reversible
    error. The appellant did testify on the drug charges and explained why his van
    had been seen at the house on a number of occasions, namely, that he left it
    there when he came into Barrie to party. He also testified that the van had
    been parked there on the two nights prior to the day in question. Moreover,
    counsel for the Crown acknowledged that, while she did not use the word
    &#8220;target&#8221; in her address to the <span class=GramE>jury, that</span> was the inference she sought to have the jury draw.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the sentence appeal, the appellant submits that the
    trial judge did not properly credit pre-trial custody &#8211; namely, 287 days
    in custody that the appellant had &#8220;banked&#8221; from a second set of
    charges that arose after the charges in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. We agree with the
    trial judge that &#8220;there is absolutely no explanation... to explain why
    [the later charges] only attracted credit for 60 days pre-sentence
    custody.&#8221; Accordingly, there is no proven link between any of the 287
    days and the charges in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
