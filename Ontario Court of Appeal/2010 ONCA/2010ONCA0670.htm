  <h2>I.          THE
    ISSUE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The central issue on this appeal arises from an
    apparent conflict between the constitutional rights of a witness in a criminal
    proceeding and the constitutional rights of the accused in that same proceeding.  The witness, N.S., an alleged victim of
    historical sexual assaults, contends that her religious beliefs dictate that
    she must wear a veil covering her face, except her eyes, when testifying.  The accused, M---d.S., who is facing serious
    criminal charges, contends that his right to make full answer and defence requires
    that he, his counsel and the preliminary inquiry judge be able to see the
    accusers face when she testifies and, in particular, when she is
    cross-examined.</p>
  <h2>II.        BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>N.S. alleges that when she was a young girl, she
    was repeatedly sexually assaulted by her uncle, the accused, M---<span
class=GramE>l.S</span>., and her cousin,<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> the
    accused, M---d.S.  In 1992, N.S. revealed
    the assaults to a teacher who spoke to N.S.s parents.  N.S.s father did not want to proceed, and
    the police did not lay charges at that time.   The accused were ultimately
    charged with various sexual offences against N.S. in two informations sworn in
    2007.  The offences allegedly occurred
    between 1982, when N.S. was six years old, and 1987.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>N.S. is a Muslim.  She wears a full body dress or hijab and a
    veil or niqab, which covers her entire face except for her eyes.  N.S. wears the hijab and niqab when she is in
    public or in the presence of males who are not direct members of her family.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  As of the date of these proceedings, N.S. had
    been wearing the hijab and niqab for about five years.  </p>
  <h2>III.       THE
    PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On September 10, 2008, M---<span class=GramE>l.S</span>.
    and M---d.S. elected trial by judge and jury.  At the outset of the preliminary inquiry, both accused sought an order
    requiring N.S. to remove the niqab covering her face when testifying at the
    preliminary inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown argued that as the application raised <i>Charter</i> issues, the preliminary inquiry
    judge did not have any power to make the order requested.  The judge determined that he did have that
    jurisdiction and decided that he would informally question N.S. about her
    objection to removing the niqab before deciding whether she would be required
    to remove it before testifying.  Crown
    counsel suggested that N.S. should have the opportunity to consult with counsel
    before being questioned. However, the judge elected to proceed immediately with
    the informal questioning.  N.S. wore her
    niqab while being questioned by the judge.  The exchange, set out below, followed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>N.S.:    Okay.  <u>So the  the objection is very strong.</u>  Its a respect issue, one of modesty and one
    of  in Islam, we call honour.  The other
    thing is the  the accuseds in the case are from the same community, they all
    go to the same place of worship as my husband as well and Ive had this veil on
    for about five years now and its  my face doesnt make any special, you know,
    like, I know that  you know, theres body language, theres eye contact.  I mean, I can look directly at the defence
    counsel, thats not a problem.  <u>But I
    dont  you know, I really feel that, you know, its a part of me and showing
    my face to  and its also about  the religious reason is to not show your
    face to men that you are able to marry.  Its to conceal the beauty of a woman and, you know, we are in a
    courtroom full of men and one of the accused is not a direct family

    preliminary inquiry judge decided that she should have counsel.  The matter was adjourned and N.S. was
    represented on the next appearance.  No
    evidence was called.  However, it is
    apparent from the transcript of the judges reasons, that during submissions he
    was advised that N.S. had her picture taken without her niqab for the purpose
    of obtaining her drivers licence.  The
    photograph had been taken by a female photographer behind a screen that
    protected N.S. from potential male onlookers.  The fact that N.S. had allowed a picture of her uncovered face to be
    taken for the purpose of her drivers licence took on some significance in the
    preliminary inquiry judges ruling.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his ruling, the preliminary inquiry judge
    described his task as balancing the right of the accused to make full answer
    and defence against N.S.s strong religious feeling that it is sinful to
    remove her niqab when testifying.  After
    reference to the limited value of demeanour in assessing credibility, the
    preliminary inquiry judge indicated that he was required to assess the
    strength of this religious belief held by the complainant and just how
    important to her, her constitutional rights and freedom of religion is.  He went on: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It may be one thing for a female photographer to
    take the picture but that drivers licence can be required to be produced by
    all sorts of males all the way from police officers and border guards and
    numerous people who simply ask for your drivers licence for the purpose of
    identification when you produce your credit card, or whatever, and <u>so it did
    not satisfy me as the trier of fact that it was consistent with the strength of
    [N.S.s] belief to be content to have her face unveiled on a drivers licence
    open not only for the female photographer to see but for numerous males and
    modern society.</u>  The other thing is
    that in investigating just how important a belief this was, it came down to her
    candid admissions that it was a matter of her being more comfortable and to
    me that really is not strong enough to fetter the accuseds right to make full
    answer and defence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So, in making this admittedly difficult decision and
    balancing the complainants right of religion against the accuseds right to
    make full answer and defence including the right to disclosure upon a
    preliminary inquiry, <u>I find that the complainants religious belief is not
    that strong, and that it is [not]<a href="#_ftn4"

    has to testify in this preliminary inquiry without the use of her veil.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h2>IV.       PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUPERIOR COURT </h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The preliminary inquiry did not proceed.  Instead, N.S. moved for an order in the
    nature of <i>certiorari</i> quashing the
    order requiring that she remove her niqab and ordering that she be allowed to
    wear her niqab when testifying.  She
    coupled her extraordinary remedy claim with an application under s. 24(1) of
    the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</i> seeking identical relief.  N.S. alleged that the preliminary inquiry judge had no jurisdiction to
    make the ruling he did, and that his order violated her right to freedom of
    religion under s. 2(a) of the <i>Charter</i>.  She also alleged that the procedure followed
    by the preliminary inquiry judge was unfair to her and resulted in
    jurisdictional error.  The Crown
    supported N.S.s position that the preliminary inquiry judge had no
    jurisdiction to require her to remove her veil before testifying at the
    preliminary inquiry.  The Crown argued
    that as constitutional values were implicated, the trial judge had exclusive
    jurisdiction to decide whether N.S. should be required to remove her niqab
    before testifying and that she could not be required to remove it at the preliminary
    inquiry.  </p>

    did not take part in the proceedings in the Superior Court.</p>

    status.  It took no position on the
    jurisdictional issue, but did make submissions as to how best to address the
    apparently competing constitutional rights of the witness and the accused.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Superior Court justice granted <i>certiorari</i> quashing the order of the
    preliminary inquiry judge.  At paras.
    83-85, he held that the preliminary inquiry judge had exceeded his jurisdiction
    by balancing <i>Charter</i> values and that
    the preliminary inquiry judges decision to question N.S. without giving her an
    opportunity to consult counsel was clearly prejudicial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the Superior Court justice concluded
    that the preliminary inquiry judge had no jurisdiction to balance competing <i>Charter</i> claims, he was satisfied that
    the preliminary inquiry judge had the jurisdiction to decide whether N.S.
    should be required to remove her niqab when testifying as requested by the accused.  At para. 101, the Superior Court justice
    traced that authority to s. 537(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which, among other things, empowers the
    preliminary inquiry judge to regulate the conduct of the proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Superior Court justice held, at paras.
    88-101, that where an application is made to require a witness to remove her
    niqab, the court must enquire into the reason for the wearing of the niqab and
    the genuineness of any religious belief relied on to explain the wearing of the
    niqab.  On this inquiry, the witness
    would be permitted to wear the niqab and could be questioned by both <span
class=GramE>counsel</span>.  If the
    preliminary inquiry judge was satisfied that the witness was wearing the niqab
    for a religious or other valid reason, she should be permitted to testify
    wearing the niqab.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At paras. 102-117, the Superior Court justice
    further directed that if the witness was allowed to testify wearing the niqab,
    she should be examined-in-chief and cross-examined on the substance of the
    allegations.  At the end of the
    cross-examination, the preliminary inquiry judge would determine whether the
    accused had been afforded the full right of cross-examination contemplated by
    s. 540(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  If the preliminary inquiry judge decided that,
    in the circumstances, the wearing of the niqab by the witness had prevented the
    accused from cross-examining the witness as that term is understood in s. 540(1),
    her testimony would be ruled inadmissible on the preliminary inquiry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Superior Court justice further held that
    proper judicial review of proceedings at the preliminary inquiry involving a
    request that a witness wear or remove a veil required that the relevant parts
    of the proceedings be video recorded.  He
    said at para. 78:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In future, when these matters arise, in order to
    permit meaningful judicial review, the preliminary inquiry judge should insist
    that the contentious portions of the proceedings involving the veiled witness
    be videotaped.  Visual aids are important
    because the absence of visual clues is the cause for complaint.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Superior Court justice made no reference to
    s. 136 or the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. C43, which places
    significant limitations on the recording of court proceedings.  An order directing that a part of this
    preliminary inquiry should be videotaped could only be made by the presiding
    judge if the requirement in s. 136(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) was met.  That provision requires a case-specific
    analysis.  There is no basis for a <i>per se</i> rule requiring videotaping in all
    cases involving a witness who proposes to testify wearing her niqab.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Superior Court justice then turned to s.
    24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  After acknowledging that a Superior Court
    justice could grant relief under s. 24(1) as a court of competent jurisdiction,
    the Superior Court justice declined to grant any remedy under that section and
    specifically declined to decide whether N.S. should be required to remove her
    niqab.  At paras. 119-121, he held that
    he could not make any determination on the record before him and that the preliminary
    inquiry was the appropriate place to create the necessary record. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Superior Court justice next addressed the
    role of the trial judge should the matter ever get to trial.  He indicated that the trial judge was a court
    of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of the <i>Charter</i> and would be required to balance the competing <i>Charter</i> values raised by the witnesss
    desire to testify while wearing a niqab.  By reference to case law, at paras. 122-142, the Superior Court justice outlined
    some of the considerations that would be relevant to that balancing
    process.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before examining those issues, I will briefly
    address two preliminary procedural matters.  The first concerns the scope of review contemplated on the <i>certiorari</i> application brought by N.S.  The second addresses the relevance of s.
    24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where an accused or the Crown seeks to review,
    by way of extraordinary remedies, decisions made at the preliminary inquiry,
    the moving party must normally demonstrate jurisdictional error:  e.g. see <i>R.
    v. Arcuri</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828; <i>R. v.
    Deschamplain</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 601; <i>Québec
    (Attorney General) v. Cohen</i>,<i> </i>[1979]
    2 S.C.R. 305.  However, where the moving
    party on the extraordinary remedy application is a third party, that is a
    party other than the accused or the Crown, and the challenged order finally
    decides the rights of the third party, extraordinary remedy relief will lie on
    the more traditional grounds of both jurisdictional error and error of law on
    the face of the record:  <i>R. v. Cunningham</i> (2010), 254 C.C.C. (3d)
    1, at paras. 57-58 (S.C.C.); <i>Dagenais v.
    Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i>,<i> </i>[1994]
    3 S.C.R. 835, at pp. 864-67.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Dagenais</i>,
    at p. 865, Lamer C.J. explained that an order prohibiting publication of court
    proceedings that offended <i>Charter</i> principles constituted an error of law on the face of the record, which was
    reviewable on a <i>certiorari</i> application.  In my view, by the same
    reasoning, an order directing a witness to remove her niqab that offended her
    right to exercise freely her religious beliefs would, absent adequate
    justification for that order, offend <i>Charter</i> principles and constitute an error of law on the face of the record.  Consequently, when a witness challenges an
    order made by the preliminary inquiry judge on the basis that the order is
    contrary to <i>Charter</i> principles, the Superior
    Court must review the correctness of the challenged decision in determining
    whether to grant extraordinary remedy relief.  The scope of review on the <i>certiorari</i> application will be the same as the scope of review on an appeal where correctness
    is the applicable standard of review.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Dagenais,</i> at p. 866, also expanded the remedies available on <i>certiorari</i> beyond the traditional order quashing the impugned order
    to include any remedy that could be granted under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  After <i>Dagenais, </i>a Superior
    Court justice seized with a <i>certiorari</i> application in respect of an order that is challenged on constitutional grounds
    may, in addition to quashing that order, grant any other relief that the
    justice could have granted on an original application under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter.</i>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second preliminary point concerns the
    relationship between this courts appellate jurisdiction and s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Appellate jurisdiction is purely statutory:  <i>R. v.
    Meltzer</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764.  Section
    24(1) does not create appellate jurisdiction but instead works within the
    existing appellate structure to provide a further source of remedial
    power:  see <i>R. v. Mills</i>,<i> </i>[1986] 1
    S.C.R. 863, per MacIntyre J. at p. 958, per LaForest J. at p. 977.  This courts jurisdiction flows from s. 784 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>which provides an appeal from a
    decision granting or refusing an order in the nature of <i>certiorari</i>.  I can find no
    statutory authority for an appeal to this court from the decision of a Superior
    Court justice either granting or refusing a remedy under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  However, in light of the broadened remedial scope available on a <i>certiorari</i> application after <i>Dagenais</i>, and this courts power on an
    appeal from an order granting or refusing <i>certiorari</i> to make the order that could have been made in the Superior Court, it would
    seem that this courts remedial powers also encompass the powers contemplated by
    s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, s. 784(2).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What does this mean?  Simply, that the claim advanced by N.S. can
    be fully addressed on its merits, and the appropriate remedial order made
    within the confines of the extraordinary remedy application.  The application to the Superior Court justice
    under s. 24(1), and the purported appeal pursuant to s. 24(1), are redundant in
    so far as the review of the order made by the preliminary inquiry judge is
    concerned:  see Kent Roach,<i> Constitutional Remedies in Canada</i>, looseleaf

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The preliminary inquiry plays an important but
    limited charge vetting role in the criminal justice system.  The preliminary inquiry judge must decide
    whether the Crown has adduced sufficient evidence to justify an accuseds
    committal for trial pursuant to s. 548 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:  <i>R. v. Caccamo</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786, at
    pp. 809-10; <i>R. v. Dubois</i>, [1986] 1
    S.C.R. 366, at pp. 373-74. As the accuseds guilt is not in issue at the
    preliminary inquiry, it is not the time or place to adjudicate the accuseds <i>Charter</i> claims.  Arguments at the preliminary inquiry about <i>Charter</i> infringements, based on an
    incomplete record which will be re-litigated if there is a trial, are bound to
    produce incorrect results and waste valuable judicial resources:  see <i>R.
    v. Hynes</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at paras. 33-43.  It is well-established that a preliminary
    inquiry judge has no jurisdiction to grant <i>Charter</i> remedies either under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> or s. 52(1) of the <i>Constitution Act,</i> <i>1982</i>:  see <i>Mills</i> (1986), at pp. 954-55; <i>R. v.

    a <i>Charter</i> remedy for an infringement
    of a <i>Charter</i> right or making a

    statutory powers.  That distinction was
    made in <i>R. v. L.R.</i> (1995), 100 C.C.C.
    (3d) 329 (Ont. C.A.), where the accused brought an application requiring the
    production at the preliminary inquiry of certain psychiatric records of the

    had jurisdiction to decide whether the records should be produced, Arbour J.A.
    said at p. 340:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>What the provincial court was asked to do in this

    contention that because there was a potential clash between the witnesss constitutionally
    protected privacy rights and the accuseds constitutionally protected full
    answer and defence rights, the preliminary inquiry judge had no jurisdiction to
    decide whether the records should be ordered produced at the preliminary
    inquiry.  She put it this way at p. 342:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my opinion, therefore, the <u>Crown could not
    bypass the competence of the Provincial Court judge to adjudicate the competing

    orders that must inevitably engage a consideration of potentially competing <i>Charter</i> values.  One example will suffice to make the
    point.  Section 537(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>h)
    authorizes a preliminary inquiry judge to close the courtroom to the public
    where the ends of justice will be best served by so doing.  In exercising that statutory power, the
    preliminary inquiry judge will inevitably be required to address values
    underlying a variety of constitutional rights, potentially including those
    protected by s. 2(b) (freedom of expression), s. 8 (privacy rights), and s.
    11(d) (fair trial rights).  Whatever
    order the preliminary inquiry judge makes, however, will be made pursuant to his
    or her statutory power under s. 537(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>h) and not pursuant
    to any <i>Charter</i> remedial power.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    found in different parts of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and other legislation that apply at the preliminary inquiry and give
    the preliminary inquiry judge powers that will inevitably be exercised having
    regard to different and competing constitutional values.  Once again, one example will suffice.  Section 714.3 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>authorizes the preliminary inquiry judge to order
    that the evidence of a witness be taken by way of audio link.  The audio link allows the witness to be
    elsewhere when testifying as long as the parties and the court can hear the
    testimony and examine that witness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 714.3 sets out various statutory
    preconditions to the exercise of the discretion granted to the judge by that
    section.  These preconditions will necessarily
    engage competing <i>Charter</i> values.  Section 714.3(a) requires the court to consider
    the circumstances of the witness.  Sometimes
    the circumstances of the witness may engage the values underlying the equality
    rights protection afforded by s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Section 714.3(d) requires the court to
    consider any potential prejudice to either of the parties.  This criterion speaks to the accuseds constitutional
    right to make full answer and defence.  As
    with the exercise of powers under Part XVIII of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, a preliminary inquiry judge who is asked to decide
    whether to permit testimony by way of audio link is exercising the specific
    statutory power given to him or her under s. 714.3.  The judge is not exercising <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction.  He or she will nonetheless engage in a balancing
    of competing <i>Charter</i> values.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    of the decisions that a preliminary inquiry judges must make, the controlling
    jurisprudence demands that a preliminary inquiry judge exercise his or her statutory
    powers in accordance with the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>Slaight
    Communications Incorporated v. Ron Davidson</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, per
    Lamer J., for the majority on this point, at pp. 1077-78; <i>The Vancouver Sun v. A.G. (Can.)</i>, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 332, at paras. <span

    102-107.  If the preliminary inquiry
    judge must render decisions that are in accordance with the <i>Charter</i>, he or she must have regard to
    competing <i>Charter</i> values and
    endeavour to render decisions that reflect an appropriate reconciliation of
    those values.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no specific statutory provision in Part
    XVIII of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that
    addresses orders involving the attire of witnesses.  The powers of the preliminary inquiry judge,
    however, include both those expressly given by statute and those that flow by
    necessary implication from the express statutory powers: <i>R. v. Girmonte</i> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 33 (Ont. C.A.), at para.

    inquiry judge may:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>...regulate the course of the inquiry in any way
    that appears <span class=GramE>to</span> the justice to be
    consistent with this <i>Act...</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The power to regulate contained in s. 537(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>i) justifies a wide variety of orders routinely made by a
    preliminary inquiry judge in the course of controlling the conduct of the
    inquiry.  Many of these orders will be
    directed at witnesses.  For example, a witness
    who is under a physical disability may ask to be allowed to testify while
    sitting rather than standing.  No one
    would question the preliminary inquiry judges power to allow the witness to
    testify while seated.  If, however, statutory
    authority is needed for such an order, it is found in s. 537(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>i).  While the
    decision would not normally be seen as reflecting <i>Charter</i> values<span class=GramE>,  it</span> does reflect a consideration of those values expressed in s. 7
    (security of the person) and s. 15 (equality).  A witness might also ask that his cross-examination be interrupted so
    that he can attend a religious observance.  The preliminary inquiry judge has the authority to interrupt the
    cross-examination and direct that the evidence of another witness be heard
    until the first witness is once again available for cross-examination.  In making that kind of order, the judge is
    regulating the course of the inquiry.  In
    this hypothetical, the preliminary inquiry judge would take into account both the
    witnesss religious beliefs and any harm caused to the defence by the
    interruption of the cross-examination.  The
    power to regulate the inquiry would also encompass a determination as to
    whether a witness should be permitted to testify through an interpreter.  Once again, constitutional values,
    specifically those protected by ss. 11(d) and 14, might well be in play.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am satisfied that just as the preliminary
    inquiry judge has the power to regulate how and when a witness will testify, he
    or she has the power to determine whether a witness should be required to change
    his or her attire before testifying.  If
    a witnesss attire is interfering with the proper conduct of the preliminary inquiry,
    the authority to regulate the conduct of that inquiry must include the ability
    to order the witness to alter his or her attire so as to permit the proper
    conduct of the inquiry.  The attire of a
    witness may be inappropriate in the courtroom for a variety of reasons.  For example, clothing that demonstrates a disrespect
    for the proceedings and thereby interferes with the proper conduct of the proceeding
    must not be tolerated.  That is, of
    course, not this case.  However, M---d.S.
    argues that the wearing of the niqab interferes with his ability to properly cross-examine
    N.S. and, therefore, interferes with the proper conduct of the inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wearing of a niqab in public places is
    controversial in many countries including Canada.  The controversy raises important public
    policy concerns that have generated heated debate.  Those difficult and important questions are
    not the focus of this proceeding and cannot and should not be resolved in this
    forum.  I think it is helpful when
    considering whether the preliminary inquiry judges power to regulate the
    proceedings extends to orders requiring the removal of the niqab, to consider
    an example that does not engender the controversy presently surrounding the
    wearing of the niqab.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Take for example, a witness who is wearing dark sunglasses
    when that witness takes the stand.  As a
    matter of course, a preliminary inquiry judge would ask the witness why he or
    she was wearing sunglasses.  There are
    several possible responses.  The witness
    may be wearing sunglasses as a fashion statement in the exercise of his or her
    right to freedom of expression.  The
    witness may be wearing sunglasses because a disability requires the witness to
    shield his or her eyes from the bright lights of the courtroom.  The witness may be wearing sunglasses to disguise
    his or her appearance out of fear that the accused may seek retribution against
    that witness.  All of these explanations
    can be expressed in terms that invoke constitutional values.  The party seeking to cross-examine the
    witness may argue that those sunglasses inhibit the questioners ability to fully
    assess the witnesss reaction to the questions and effectively cross-examine
    the witness.  This, too, impacts on
    constitutional values.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Were the sunglasses hypothetical to occur, no
    one could reasonably question the preliminary inquiry judges power to decide
    whether the witness should be allowed to wear sunglasses while <span
class=GramE>testifying.</span>  I cannot
    imagine that anyone would suggest that the judge could not make that decision,
    after conducting the appropriate inquiry, because deciding the question involved
    balancing <i>Charter</i> values.  I am also certain that, were the sunglasses
    hypothetical to arise, it would be addressed and resolved expeditiously in the
    exercise of the judges power to regulate the inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not suggest that the issues surrounding the
    wearing of the niqab can necessarily be resolved as easily as the issues
    arising out the sunglasses hypothetical.  I do think, however, that insofar as the preliminary inquiry judges exercise
    of his or her jurisdiction is concerned, the two problems are not qualitatively
    different.  In both instances, the
    preliminary inquiry judge has to regulate the preliminary inquiry by deciding
    whether the witness will be allowed to wear what the witness wants to wear
    while testifying.  In exercising that
    statutory power, the preliminary inquiry judge will take into account the impact
    of that attire on the proceedings and the effect of any order he or she may
    make on the legitimate interests of the accused and the other participants in
    the process.  Whether the question
    involves the wearing of the niqab or the wearing of sunglasses, the preliminary
    inquiry judge is not deciding whether there is a <i>Charter</i> breach and is not granting or refusing a <i>Charter</i> remedy.  The preliminary inquiry judge is, as
    authorized by s. 537(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>i), regulating the course of
    the preliminary inquiry to ensure that it can perform its proper function.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(ii)  Did the preliminary inquiry judge err in law

    and analysis, I think it is important to remind <span class=GramE>ones</span> self
    of what is at stake in human terms.  N.S.
    is facing a most difficult and intimidating task.  She must describe intimate, humiliating and
    painful details of her childhood.  She
    must do so, at least twice, in a public forum in which her credibility and
    reliability will be vigorously challenged and in which the person she says abused
    her is cloaked in the presumption of innocence.  The pressures and pain that complainants in a sexual assault case must feel
    when testifying will no doubt be compounded in these circumstances where N.S.
    is testifying against family members.  It
    should not surprise anyone that N.S., when faced with this daunting task, seeks
    the strength and solace of her religious beliefs and practices.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>M---d.S. is facing serious criminal
    charges.  If convicted, he may well go to
    jail for a considerable period of time.  He will also wear the stigma of the child molester for the rest of his
    life.  In all likelihood, the mere fact
    that charges have been laid has led many within his family and community who
    are aware of those charges to look at <span class=GramE>M---d.S. in a very different way.</span>  M---d.S. is presumed innocent.  His fate will depend on whether N.S. is believed.  In a very real sense, the rest of M---d.S.s
    life depends on whether his counsel can show that N.S. is not a credible or
    reliable witness.  No one can begrudge M---d.S.s
    insistence that his lawyer have available all of the means that could
    reasonably assist in getting at the truth of the allegations made against
    him.    </p>

    quandary faced by the preliminary inquiry judge.  Both M---d.S. and N.S. have powerful claims that
    seem to lead to diametrically opposed conclusions.  At least at first blush, it would appear that
    the constitutional values in issue collide.  Faced with an apparent collision of constitutional values, a court must
    first attempt to reconcile the rights so that each is given full force and
    effect within the relevant context:  <i>Reference Re Same Sex Marriage</i>, [2004] 3
    S.C.R. 698, at para. 50.  As Justice
    Iacobucci put it, writing extra-judicially in Reconciling Rights The Supreme
    Court of Canadas Approach to Competing <i>Charter</i> Rights (2002), 20 S.C.L.R. (2d) 137, at p. 140 [Reconciling Rights]: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, it is proper for courts to give the fullest
    possible expression to all relevant <i>Charter</i> rights, having regard to the broader factual context and to the other
    constitutional values at stake.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reconciliation of apparently conflicting rights
    requires that no <i>Charter</i> right be
    treated as absolute and that no one right be regarded as inherently superior to
    another:  <i>R. v. Mills</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at para. 61; <i>Dagenais</i>,<i> </i>at p. 877; <i>R. v. Crawford</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 858, at
    para. 34.  Nor can the reconciliation of
    competing rights be addressed in the abstract without regard to the specific
    factual context.  Once again, I borrow
    the  words of Justice Iacobucci in
    Reconciling Rights, at p. 141:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The key to rights reconciliation, in my view, lies
    in a fundamental appreciation for <i>context</i>.  <i>Charter</i> rights are not defined in abstraction, but rather in the particular factual
    matrix in which they arise.  When
    understood in this way, the exercise of reconciling competing <i>Charter</i> values becomes a less onerous
    and daunting task. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(b)  Fair Trial Rights</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first step in the reconciliation process
    requires one to identify and describe the constitutional values engaged by the
    competing arguments.  I will begin with M---d.S.  Mr. Dineen, counsel for M---d.S., submits, correctly,
    that his clients statutory right to cross-examine witnesses called by the
    Crown at the preliminary inquiry, pursuant to s. 450, is a component of his
    right to make full answer and defence at trial.  That right is protected under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>Mills</i> (1999), at para. 69; <i>R. v. E.B.</i> (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 741 (C.A.), at para. 44.  Cross-examination has been repeatedly described as a matter of
    fundamental importance that is integral to the conduct of a fair trial and a
    meaningful application of the presumption of innocence:  see <i>R.
    v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 663-65; <i>Mills</i> (1999), at para. 72-76; <i>R.
    v. Lyttle</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193.  In <i>Lyttle</i>, at para. 41, Fish J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he right of an accused to <u>cross-examine
    prosecution witnesses without significant and unwarranted constraint is an
    essential component of the right to make full answer and defence</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, cross-examination is not an end in and
    of itself.  Rather, it is one of the
    means by which the accused makes full answer and defence.  Full answer and defence is, in turn, a crucial
    component of a fair trial, a constitutionally protected right and the ultimate
    goal of the criminal process.  Trial
    fairness is not measured exclusively from the accuseds perspective but also takes
    account of broader societal interests.  Those
    broader interests place a premium on a process that achieves accurate and
    reliable verdicts in a manner that respects the rights and dignity of all
    participants in the process, including, but not limited to, the accused:  <i>Osolin</i>,
    at pp. 667-72; <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991]
    2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 603; <i>Mills </i>(1999),
    at paras. 72-76, 94; <i>R. v. L.O.</i>,
    [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not every limit on the right to cross-examination
    compromises trial fairness.  The right to
    cross-examine witnesses does not extend to questions that will elicit evidence that
    undermines the truth-seeking function of the court.  Nor does the right to cross-examination
    extend to any and all questions that may adduce relevant evidence no matter how
    minimally probative and regardless of the harm those questions may do to other
    legitimate interests, such as national security or a witnesss constitutionally
    protected privacy right.  Nor are the limits
    on cross-examination to be considered in isolation from other procedural aspects
    of the criminal trial.  Trial fairness is
    ultimately measured by reference to the entirety of the process:  <i>R. v.
    Darrach</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, at paras. 23-25; <i>R. v. Rose</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262.  For example, appropriate jury instructions may go some considerable way
    to mitigate any unfairness that may flow from an evidentiary or procedural rule
    that has limited the scope of cross-examination.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cross-examination involves, first and foremost,
    the eliciting of evidence from prosecution witnesses through the process of
    oral questions and answers.  In the
    accepted tradition of the common law, questioning occurs in a public forum in
    the presence of the judge, Crown counsel, the accused and his counsel, the
    witness and the public:  <i>R. v. Levogiannis</i> (1991), 1 O.R. (3d)
    351 (C.A.), at p. 366, affd [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475; <i>R. v. Davis</i>, [2008] 3 All E.R. 461 (H.L.), at para. 22.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While it is clear that face to face
    confrontation between the accused and prosecution witnesses is the accepted
    norm in Canadian criminal courts, there is no independent constitutional right
    to a face to face confrontation:  <i>Levogiannis</i>, at p.  367. There are a number of evidentiary rules,
    both statutory (s. 715 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>) and common law (some hearsay exceptions) that admit statements made
    by declarants who do not testify at trial at all.  Departures from the traditional face to face
    public confrontation between accused and witness will run afoul of the <i>Charter</i> only if they result in a denial
    of a fair trial to the accused.  The <i>Charter</i> focuses not on face to face
    confrontation <i>per</i> <i>se</i>, but on the effect of any limitation
    on that confrontation on the fairness of the trial.  Fairness takes into account the interests of
    the accused, the witness and the broader societal concern that the process
    maintains public confidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Covering the face of a witness may impede
    cross-examination in two ways.  First, it
    limits the trier of facts ability to assess the demeanour of the witness.  Demeanour is relevant to the assessment of
    the witnesss credibility and the reliability of the evidence given by that
    witness.  Second, witnesses do not respond
    to questions by words alone.  Non-verbal
    communication can provide the cross-examiner with valuable insights.  The same words may, depending on the facial
    expression of the witness, lead the questioner in different directions.  In <i>Police
    v. Razamjoo</i>, [2005] DCR 408, a New Zealand trial judge faced with an
    application by two Muslim witnesses to testify wearing veils said this at para.
    81:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Although effective cross-examination is generally
    the outcome of careful preparation and a thorough grasp of the case, the actual
    process is often partly instinctive.  It
    involves an ongoing evaluation of how the witness is performing and,
    particularly what are sensitive areas from that witnesss point of view.  Tiny signals, quite often in the form of, or
    involving, facial expressions are received and acted upon almost, sometimes
    completely, unconsciously by the cross-examiner.  Cross-examining counsel do not have the
    luxury of being able to make judgments as to what to ask and how to ask it
    against an overview such as a judge enjoys at the conclusion of a case.  A distinction needs to be drawn between the
    significance of demeanour in the context of such an overview and the
    significance of demeanour to counsel in what is, in many ways, a heat of
    battle situation, in making what need to be virtually instantaneous decisions
    in the course of conducting a cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Butt, counsel for N.S., makes the valid
    point that credibility assessments based on demeanour can be unreliable and
    flat-out wrong.  Assessments of
    credibility based on demeanour can reflect cultural assumptions and biases.  Judgments based on demeanour are no substitute
    for those based on a critical analysis of the substance of the entire
    evidence.  Appellate courts have
    repeatedly cautioned against relying exclusively or even predominantly on
    demeanour to determine credibility.  Mr.
    Butt also makes the valid point that the trier of fact does not lose all
    aspects of demeanour evidence if the witness wears a niqab.  The trier of fact will still be able to
    consider the witnesss body language, her eyes, her tone of voice and the
    manner in which she responds to questions.  All are important aspects of demeanour. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is, however, undeniable that the criminal
    justice system as it presently operates, and as it has operated for centuries, places
    considerable value on the ability of lawyers and the trier of fact to see the
    full face of the witness as the witness testifies.  Appellate deference is justified to a
    significant extent on the accepted wisdom that trial judges and juries have an
    advantage over appeal judges in assessing factual questions because they,
    unlike appeal judges, have seen and heard the witnesses:  <i>R. v.
    R.E.M.</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at p. 22. Similarly, the principled approach to
    the admission of hearsay evidence recognizes the value, insofar as the assessment
    of reliability is concerned, in the trier of facts ability to observe the
    witnesss demeanour as the witness made a statement which is proffered as
    evidence of its truth:  see <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, at
    pp. 763-64.</p>

    addition to assisting in assessing the witnesss credibility and providing
    non-verbal cues to assist the cross-examiner, may also further cross-examination
    in other ways in certain specific cases.  There may be cases where the identity of the witness is an issue.  In those cases, the opportunity to look at
    the witness may be essential to identifying the witness which, in turn, may be
    crucial to effective cross-examination of that witness or to other aspects of
    the defence.  For example, a witness may
    claim to have spoken to an accused at a certain time and place.  Seeing the face of the witness may allow the
    accused to indentify the witness in a way that will assist the accused in the
    cross examination and <span class=GramE>may</span> perhaps also provide some
    explanation as to why the witness might fabricate or be mistaken about the
    content of the conversation.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There may also be sexual assault cases where the
    accused contends that neither the name of the complainant nor the details of
    the allegations provided in the disclosure mean anything to him.  In effect, the accused asserts that the
    charges against him are a terrible mistake and he is at a loss to understand
    the basis for the charge.  I am not sure
    how an accused could defend <span class=GramE>himself</span> in that situation without

    the complainants facial appearance may have relevance to the truth of her
    allegations.  For example, the
    complainant may have given a statement to the police in which she describes an
    attack that would inevitably have left some visible marks on her face.  An accused may argue that he can only test
    that part of the complainants evidence by seeing her face during
    cross-examination at the preliminary inquiry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The criminal justice system assumes that the
    truth is most likely to emerge through a public adversarial process.  Face-to-face confrontation, especially
    between an accused and his accuser, is a feature of that adversarial
    process.  The value of confrontation to
    the cross-examiner cannot be dismissed because credibility assessments based on
    demeanour, like credibility assessments based on anything else, can prove to be
    wrong.  An accused <span class=GramE>who</span> is denied the right to see the full face of a Crown witness, particularly the accuser,
    during cross-examination loses something of potential value to the defence.  Whether he loses his constitutional right to make
    full answer and defence in a fair trial will depend on a fact-specific inquiry.  That inquiry must look to the actual effect
    of denying face-to-face confrontation of the witness in the circumstances of
    the particular case.  That inquiry must
    also have regard to other legitimate interests engaged in the circumstances and
    the constitutional values underlying those interests.  I will return to the contextual issues that
    arise in this case after addressing the other key component of the
    reconciliation of rights analysis in this case: N.S.s claim that she is

    broad and expansive approach to religious freedom:  <i>Syndicat
    Northcrest v. Amselem</i>, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 551, at para. 62.  The protection afforded to religious freedom
    reaches both religious beliefs and conduct that is motivated by or manifests
    those beliefs.  The protection afforded
    to religious belief is, however, considerably broader than the protection
    afforded to conduct manifesting that belief:  <i>Trinity Western University v.
    British Columbia College of Teachers</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 772, at para.

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    at paras. 46-47, Iacobucci J. described the constitutional protection afforded
    freedom of religion as:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The freedom to undertake practices and harbour
    beliefs, having a nexus with religion, in which an individual demonstrates he
    or she sincerely believes or is sincerely undertaking in order to connect with
    the divine or as a function of his or her spiritual faith, irrespective of
    whether a particular practice or belief is required by official religious dogma
    or is in conformity with the position of religious officials.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But, at the same time, this freedom encompasses
    objective as well as personal notions of religious belief, obligation, <span
class=GramE>precept</span>, commandment, custom or ritual.  Consequently, both obligatory as well as
    voluntary expressions of faith should be protected under the Quebec (and the
    Canadian) <i>Charter</i>.  It is the religious or spiritual essence of
    an action, not any mandatory or perceived  as  mandatory nature of its <span
class=GramE>observance, that</span> attracts protection.  An inquiry into the mandatory nature of an
    alleged religious practice is not only inappropriate, it is plagued with
    difficulties.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Iacobucci J., at para. 56, described the
    approach to be taken to a claim that conduct was protected by s. 2(a) of the <i>Charter</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Thus, at the first stage of a religious freedom
    analysis, an individual advancing an issue premised upon a freedom of religion
    claim must show the court that (1) <u>he or she has a practice or belief having
    a nexus with religion, which calls for a particular line of conduct</u>, either
    by being objectively or subjectively obligatory or customary, or by, in
    general, subjectively engendering a personal connection with the divine or with
    the subject or object of an individuals spiritual faith, irrespective of
    whether a particular practice or belief is required by official religious dogma
    or is in conformity with the position of religious officials; and (2) he or <u>she
    is sincere in his or her belief</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under the controlling jurisprudence, an
    infringement of s. 2(a) will be made out where the claimant demonstrates, first,
    a sincere belief in a practice that has a nexus with his or her religious
    beliefs and, second, that the impugned measure interferes with the claimants
    ability to act in accordance with those religious beliefs in a way that goes
    beyond the trivial or insubstantial:  <i>Amselem</i>, at paras. 57-61; <i>Multani</i>, at para. 34; <i>Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike an accuseds right to make full answer
    and defence in a fair trial, a witnesss right to freedom of religion is not
    inherently triggered by participation in the criminal justice process.  A witness who seeks to exercise a religious
    practice while testifying must establish that the practice falls within the
    scope of the right to freedom of religion as described in the Supreme Court of
    Canada authorities cited above.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given the subjective and personal nature of a
    freedom of religion claim as explained in <i>Amselem</i>,
    that inquiry must almost inevitably involve testimony from the witness
    explaining the connection between the practice in issue and his or her
    religious beliefs.  Nor do I think that
    it does any injustice to call upon the witness who claims that his or her
    religious beliefs compel certain conduct to adduce evidence to establish that
    claim within the parameters set out in <i>Amselem</i> and subsequent cases from the Supreme Court of Canada.  I would think that, in most cases, the
    inquiry would be relatively straightforward and would be limited to the
    witnesss explanation for following the course of conduct in issue.  I note that Mr. Butt, in oral argument, advised
    the court that N.S. welcomed the opportunity to explain to a judge why she felt
    the very real obligation to wear her niqab while testifying.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In evaluating the evidence advanced in support
    of the religious freedom claim, a court is interested only in whether the practice
    is a manifestation of the sincerely held personal, religious belief of the
    witness.  The court will not enter into theological
    debates.  Nor is conformity with
    established or accepted religious practices the ultimate measure of the
    sincerity of ones religious beliefs.  The inquiry looks to the personal beliefs of the claimant.  In this case, it is the manner in which N.S.
    interprets and practises Islam as it relates to the wearing of the niqab that
    is important:  <i>Multani</i>, at paras. 32-33<span class=GramE>.  <i>Amselem</i></span>,
    at para. 53, describes the nature of the inquiry into religious belief in these
    terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Assessment of sincerity is a question of fact that
    can be based on several non-exhaustive criteria, including the credibility of
    the claimants testimony [citation omitted], as well as an analysis of whether
    the alleged belief is consistent with his or her other current religious
    practices.  It is important to
    underscore, however, that it is inappropriate for courts rigorously to study
    and focus on the past practices of claimants in order to determine whether
    their current beliefs are sincerely held. ... Because of the vacillating nature
    of religious belief, a courts inquiry into sincerity, if anything, should
    focus not on past practice or past belief but on a persons belief at the time
    of the alleged interference with his or her religious freedom.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In measuring the sincerity of N.S.s asserted
    religious belief, her decision to allow her picture to be taken without her
    niqab to obtain her drivers licence (and any other exceptions she may make) may
    provide some insight into whether her current religious beliefs dictate that
    she wear the niqab while testifying.  A
    court cannot, however, reason that because a person has made exceptions to her
    religious beliefs in the past, or perhaps has simply failed to follow her
    religious practices in the past, that her present assertion of those beliefs is
    not sincere.  Past practice cannot be
    equated with present belief.  Few among
    us who have religious beliefs can claim to have always acted in accordance with
    those beliefs.  Past perfection is not a
    prerequisite to the exercise of ones constitutional right to religious freedom.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Without attempting an exhaustive description of
    the inquiry that would be appropriate in this case, I think it would be
    important, given the information provided concerning the licence photograph, to
    determine the extent to which N.S.s belief that she must wear a niqab in
    public admits of exceptions.  If that
    belief admits of an exception that could reasonably cover the circumstance of a
    witness testifying at a criminal trial, I do not think that N.S.s right to
    religious freedom would extend to her decision that she would not avail herself
    of that exception in this particular situation.  If testifying without the niqab  perhaps in modified circumstances,
    including, if need be, the exclusion of the male public except for the accused
    and counsel  would fall within the boundary of the exceptions that N.S. has recognized
    to her requirement to wear a niqab in public, requiring her to remove that
    niqab to testify, even if she did not want to do so, would not interfere with
    her ability to act in accordance with her personal religious beliefs.  </p>

    religious beliefs compel her to wear a niqab when testifying and with a claim
    by the accused that the wearing of the niqab interferes with his ability to
    cross-examine, should begin by determining whether the constitutional values
    underlying both claims are in fact engaged in the specific circumstances.   The court should first make the necessary
    inquiry to determine whether the course of action the witness seeks to follow
    is religiously motivated and that her belief is sincerely held.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the judge is satisfied that the witness has
    advanced a valid religious right claim, the judge must next determine the
    extent, if at all, <span class=GramE>to</span> which wearing the niqab would
    interfere with the accuseds ability to cross-examine the witness.  At this stage, the judge is not deciding
    whether wearing the niqab would result in a denial of the accuseds right to
    cross-examine and to a fair trial, but only whether the wearing of the niqab would
    impose an impediment on cross-examination that was more than minimal or
    insignificant.  This assessment must be
    fact-specific.  For example, if the
    witnesss credibility was not in issue and she was giving evidence on a
    peripheral non-contentious matter, I would think that the judge would determine
    that any limit the wearing of the niqab imposed on her cross-examination was so
    insignificant that it could be safely disregarded.   If the judge were to conclude, in the
    specific circumstances of a given case, that allowing the witness to wear her
    niqab did not interfere with cross-examination, or interfered only to a minimal
    extent, the accuseds right to make full answer and defence would not be
    engaged.  A minimal interference with
    cross-examination would not impair an accuseds right to a fair trial and would
    not justify any limitation on the witnesss exercise of her right to freedom of
    religion:  <i>Amselem</i>, at para. 84.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A judge can take judicial notice of the
    relevance of demeanour to the assessment of a witnesss credibility and reliability.  The judge could also take judicial notice of
    the potential assistance that demeanour could afford to the cross-examiner in the
    course of conducting that cross-examination.  If, however, the defence contention is that the wearing of the niqab
    impairs cross-examination beyond the ways described above, it is incumbent upon
    the defence to establish those claims.  For example, if the defence contends that the identity of the witness is
    in issue and, therefore, her face must be exposed, the defence must demonstrate
    an air of reality to that claim before it will be taken into account in
    assessing the extent to which the wearing of the niqab may affect
    cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the judge is satisfied that both the
    witnesss religious freedom claim and the accuseds right to cross-examine
    claim are sufficiently engaged, the judge must then attempt to reconcile those
    two rights by giving effect to both.  It
    is at this stage that context becomes particularly important.  Context includes the somewhat limited manner
    in which the wearing of the niqab interferes with the trier of facts
    assessment based on demeanour.  The trier
    of fact still hears and sees the witness.  Tone of voice, eye movements, body language, and the manner in which the
    witness testifies, all important aspects of demeanour, are unaffected by the
    wearing of the niqab.  Nor does the
    wearing of the niqab prevent the witness from being subjected to a vigorous and
    thorough cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The contextual factors outlined above do not
    stand alone.  Other features of the trial
    process will also impact upon the effect the wearing of a niqab has on the
    ability to cross-examine the witness.  In
    jury cases, the judges instructions will play a significant role.  In determining whether to allow the witness to
    wear her niqab, a judge in a jury case will bear in mind that the jury will be
    instructed that the onus of proof is on the Crown and that any difficulties the
    jury may encounter in assessing the credibility of a Crown witness because that
    witness is wearing a niqab must redound against the Crown as the party bearing
    the onus of proof.  An instruction in
    these terms could well go a long way to negative any negative impact on the
    defence flowing from a limitation on the ability to cross-examine a witness who
    is wearing a niqab.</p>

    proceeding:  <i>M. (A.) v. Ryan</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157.  The reconciliation may be very different at a
    preliminary inquiry, where the witnesss credibility is essentially irrelevant,
    than at trial, where the outcome of the case and the accuseds liberty may turn
    entirely on the witnesss credibility.  A
    defence claim that it cannot cross-examine the witness if she is wearing a
    niqab based entirely on broad arguments about the impact of the loss of
    demeanour evidence may have little force when made at the preliminary inquiry
    stage.  The same arguments will carry more
    force at trial, especially if the witnesss credibility is central to the
    Crowns case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The forum in which the trial will be conducted
    is also part of the context.  If the case
    is to be tried by a judge alone, that judge during the inquiry into the
    witnesss religious freedom claim may well develop a sense of the extent to
    which the wearing of the niqab will affect that judges ability to make a
    proper assessment of the witness.  The
    judge could properly take that impression into account in deciding how best to
    reconcile the witnesss right to freedom of religion with the accuseds right
    to full cross-examination.  Where,
    however, the case is tried by a jury, it will be for the jury to ultimately
    determine the effect of the niqab on its ability to accurately assess the
    credibility and reliability of the witness.  The potential significance of the jury in assessing whether the witness
    should be required to remove her niqab was alluded to in the recent decision of <i>R. v. Anwar Sayed</i> (19 August 2010),
    Perth 164/2010 (WADC), a decision of Her Honour Justice Deanne of the District
    Court of Western Australia:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Being in a position to view a witnesss face
    whilst that person is giving evidence may or may not in the end assist jury
    members to determine issues of credibility or reliability, but that is a matter
    entirely for them.  The jury are the only
    people who can answer that question at the relevant time.</u>  It appears to me that the fundamental
    question is whether or not the court in the circumstances of this particular
    case, insofar as they are known, should deny the members of the jury that
    opportunity. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Context also includes the nature of the evidence
    to be given by the witness who wants to wear her niqab.  If her evidence is relatively peripheral, or
    if it is clear that the witnesss credibility will not be an issue, arguments
    that the removal of the niqab is essential to permit cross-examination become
    weak.  However, where the witness who claims
    the right to wear a niqab is central to the prosecution case and her
    credibility is virtually determinative of the outcome, an argument that a full
    view of the witnesss face, at least at trial, is essential to
    cross-examination becomes a much stronger argument.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The nature of the defence to be advanced and any
    specific grounds linking the ability to see the witnesss face to the defences
    ability to make full answer and defence, are also part of the context.  I have set out some examples earlier in these
    reasons where the position of the defence gives added significance to the
    opportunity to see the face of the witness when she testifies.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the
    contextual analysis is that which requires the court to take into account other
    constitutional values and societal interests that may be affected by the
    judges decision whether a witness should be required to remove her niqab.  N.S. is a <span class=GramE>Muslim,</span> a
    minority that many believe is unfairly maligned and stereotyped in contemporary
    Canada.  A failure to give adequate
    consideration to N.S.s religious beliefs would reflect and, to some extent,
    legitimize that negative stereotyping.  Allowing her to wear a niqab could be seen as a recognition and
    acceptance of those minority beliefs and practices and, therefore, a reflection
    of the multi-cultural heritage of Canada recognized in s. 27 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Permitting N.S. to wear her niqab would also broaden access to the
    justice system for those in the position of N.S., by indicating that
    participation in the justice system would not come at the cost of compromising ones
    religious beliefs.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>N.S. is also a woman testifying as an alleged
    victim in a sexual assault case.  Permitting her to wear her niqab while testifying would recognize her as
    an individual and acknowledge the particularly vulnerable position she is in
    when testifying as an alleged victim in a sexual assault prosecution.  Adjusting the process to ameliorate the
    hardships faced by a complainant like N.S. promotes gender equality.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is also a significant public interest in
    getting at the truth in a criminal proceeding.  Arguably, permitting N.S. to testify while wearing her niqab would
    promote that interest.  Without the
    niqab, N.S. would be testifying in an environment that was strange and
    uncomfortable for her.  One could not
    expect her to be herself on the witness stand.  A trier of fact could be misled by her demeanour.  Her embarrassment and discomfort could be misinterpreted
    as uncertainty and unreliability.  Furthermore, there may be cases where the Crown determines that it
    cannot in good conscience call upon the witness to testify if she is forced to
    remove her niqab.  In those cases, the evidence
    will be lost and a trial on the merits may be impossible  hardly a result that
    serves the public interest in the due administration of justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is also a societal interest pointing
    against a witness wearing a niqab when testifying.  Society has a strong interest in the visible
    administration of criminal justice in open courts where witnesses, lawyers,
    judges and the accused can be seen and identified by the public.  A public accusation and a public response to
    that accusation, in a forum which tests the truth of the accusation through the
    adversarial process, <span class=GramE>enhances</span> public confidence in the
    administration of criminal justice.  All engaged
    in the criminal process, including witnesses, judges and lawyers, are
    ultimately accountable to the public.  Allowing
    a witness to testify with her face partly covered affords the witness a degree
    of anonymity that undermines the transparency and individual accountability
    essential to the effective operation of the criminal justice system.  Viewed from this perspective, allowing N.S.
    to wear a niqab while she testifies could compromise public confidence both in
    the conduct of the criminal trial and in the eventual verdict: see Ian Dennis,
    The Right to Confront Witnesses: Meanings, Myths and Human Rights (2010) 4
    Crim. L. R. 255, at pp. 260-62.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Obviously, these diverse interests cannot all be
    given full voice.  The reconciliation
    process does, however, demand that each be acknowledged and considered in the
    course of arriving at the appropriate order.  The judges reasons for whatever decision he or she makes take on an
    important role.  If those reasons
    demonstrate a full and sensitive appreciation of the various interests at
    stake, the reasons themselves become part of the reconciliation of the
    apparently competing interests.  If a
    person has a full opportunity to present his or her position and is given a
    reasoned explanation for the ultimate course of conduct to be followed, the
    recognition afforded that persons rights by that process itself tends to validate
    that persons claim, even if the ultimate decision does not give that person
    everything he or she wanted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not only is context crucial in reconciling
    rights but, as Ms. Nakelsky, Crown counsel, submitted, possible constructive
    compromises must also be considered as part of the reconciliation process.  Measures may be available to mitigate any
    potential harm to both the witnesss right to exercise her religious beliefs
    and the accuseds right to fully defend <span class=GramE>himself</span>.  These compromises may minimize apparent
    conflicts between those two rights and produce a process in which both values
    can be adequately protected and respected.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Attempts to reconcile competing interests using
    constructive compromises might include the use of an all female court staff and
    a female judge.  Those measures might
    also include, where constitutionally permissible, an order that a witness be
    cross-examined by female counsel.  Consideration might also be given to using the measures provided for in
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> to protect complainants
    testifying in sexual assault cases and child witnesses.  If necessary, the court could be closed to
    all male persons other than the accused and his counsel.  In this case, resort to the measures outlined
    above could result in N.S., if she was required to remove her niqab, revealing
    her face to only one male person, M---d.S., to whom her religious beliefs
    indicated she should not.<a href="#_ftn10"

    that intrusion, it certainly respects and protects her religious rights much
    more than would a simple order that she remove her niqab.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Efforts to reconcile competing rights would also
    entitle the judge to explore with the witness the extent to which her religious
    beliefs might be fully respected while minimizing the impact on the accuseds
    fair trial rights.  For example, during
    the inquiry into the witnesss religious freedom claim, the witness may
    indicate that she wears different styles of niqabs and/or <span class=GramE>that
    different fabrics</span> are used in the niqab.  If such evidence was before the judge, he or she could call upon the
    witness to wear a style of niqab made with a kind of fabric that least
    interferes with the trier of facts ability to assess her demeanour.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> It is
    also important in considering how to reconcile rights, to bear in mind that the
    trial judge may reassess his or her initial decision as the matter proceeds. A
    judge may, after seeing the witness testify wearing her niqab on the inquiry
    into her religious beliefs, decide that she should be permitted to wear the
    niqab as she begins her testimony concerning the allegations.  The judge could change that ruling as the
    testimony progressed if the judge decided that the actual effect on the
    cross-examination was more significant than he or she expected. As is evident
    from the trial judges observations in <i>Razamjoo</i>,
    at para. 69, the effect of wearing the niqab will vary from case to case and
    may well be different than the anticipated or assumed effect.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Efforts to reconcile the rights of the witness
    and the accused may ultimately fail.  A
    judge may conclude that in all of the circumstances, and despite resort to
    available modifications in the process, including, in jury cases, the
    appropriate instruction, the witnesss wearing of the niqab would significantly
    impair the accuseds ability to cross-examine that witness and result in a
    denial of the accuseds right to make full answer and defence and his right to
    a fair trial.  If the judge concludes
    that the wearing of the niqab in all of the circumstances would infringe the
    accuseds right to make full answer and <span class=GramE>defence, that</span> right must prevail over the witnesss religious freedoms and the witness must

    yield, I rely on<i> Mills</i> (1999), in
    which the accuseds right to make full answer and defence potentially clashed
    with a complainants privacy interest in her psychiatric records.  After a discussion of the reconciliation of these
    competing rights in the context of a criminal trial, the majority said, at
    para. 89:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>From our preceding discussion of the right to make
    full answer and defence, it is clear that the accused will have no right to the
    records in question insofar as they contain information that is either
    irrelevant or would serve to distort the search for the truth, as access to
    such information is not included within the ambit of the accuseds right. ... <u>However,
    the accuseds right must prevail where the lack of disclosure on production of
    the record would render him unable to make full answer and defence.  This is because our justice system has always
    held that the threat of convicting an innocent individual strikes at the heart
    of the principles of fundamental justice.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The preliminary inquiry judge was in uncharted
    waters.  With respect, I think he failed
    to conduct an adequate inquiry into N.S.s claim that her religious beliefs
    compelled her to wear her niqab while testifying.  The limited and informal inquiry conducted by
    the preliminary inquiry judge did not permit a determination of whether an
    order directing N.S. to remove her niqab would undermine her right to freedom
    of religion.  The judge fastened on N.S.s
    having removed her niqab for the purpose of obtaining her drivers licence
    photograph and her indication to him that she was more comfortable testifying
    with the niqab as indicia that her religious belief was not that strong.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not only did the preliminary inquiry judge have
    inadequate information to determine the validity of N.S.s religious right claim,
    his determination based on his own assessment of the strength of her religious
    beliefs was not consistent with the criteria set out in the jurisprudence from
    the Supreme Court of Canada.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The preliminary inquiry judge also erred in not
    acceding to the Crowns request and giving N.S. an opportunity to consult with
    counsel before questioning her about her religious beliefs.  She was entitled to the opportunity to speak
    to a lawyer at that stage given the very significant issue at stake for
    her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>N.S. should have been allowed to testify to and
    explain the connection between her religious beliefs and the wearing of the
    niqab while testifying, and to demonstrate the sincerity of those beliefs.  She should also have been given the opportunity
    to call any further evidence on the issue.  M---d.S. and the Crown should have been given the opportunity to
    question N.S. However, those questions would have had to have been relevant to
    the issues germane to the religious belief inquiry.  The Crown and defence should also have had the
    opportunity to call evidence on the issue.  I would stress, however, the narrow focus of the inquiry into N.S.s
    religious beliefs.  Maintaining that
    focus should avoid a prolonged proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the defence argument that the wearing of the
    niqab interferes with the making of full answer and defence extends beyond claims
    based on the witnesss demeanour and reliability, the defence should have the
    opportunity, once the religious claim is established, to put that position
    forward.  I would not think that this
    would generally require the calling of evidence.  For example, if the identity of the witness
    is an issue, the defence may be able to demonstrate its concern by reference to
    material provided by way of Crown disclosure.  Submissions by defence counsel as to the nature of the defence should
    also suffice.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The preliminary inquiry judge did not conduct a
    proper inquiry into N.S.s religious freedom claim.  His order directing her to remove her niqab
    while testifying constituted an error in law on the face of the record. That
    order should be quashed.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(iii)  Can this court make a definitive order?</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It follows from my reasons that I would affirm, albeit
    on different grounds, the order of the Superior Court justice quashing the
    order of the preliminary inquiry judge.  A determination of whether N.S. should be allowed to testify wearing her
    niqab, and/or what modifications should be made in the process, can only be
    made after the inquiry outlined in these reasons.  I would remit the matter to the preliminary
    inquiry judge for the completion of the preliminary inquiry.  If the judge is required to determine whether
    N.S. can wear her niqab while testifying, he will do so in accordance with these
    reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have stressed the need for a case-by-case
    assessment of the kind of claim raised in this case.  Reconciling competing <i>Charter</i> values is necessarily fact-specific.  Context is vital and context is variable.  Bright line rules do not work.  However, hopefully for the assistance of
    those charged with the responsibility of making these decisions at first
    instance, I would offer these observations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If a witness establishes that wearing her niqab
    is a legitimate exercise of her religious freedoms, then the onus moves to the
    accused to show why the exercise of this constitutionally protected right would
    compromise his constitutionally protected right to make full answer and
    defence.  I would think that a defence
    objection to the wearing of the niqab at the preliminary inquiry, based exclusively
    on the argument that the witnesss facial demeanour was important in the
    assessment of credibility or to assist the cross-examination, would fail, at
    least to the extent that the judge would begin by permitting the witness to
    wear her niqab while giving her evidence.  As explained earlier in these reasons, the preliminary inquiry judge
    could revisit his or her initial decision in the unlikely event that as the cross-examination
    proceeded, it became apparent that the wearing of the niqab was effectively
    denying counsel the ability to cross-examine the witness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While a defence objection to a witness wearing her
    niqab at the preliminary inquiry, based exclusively on the asserted loss of
    demeanour evidence, would in all likelihood fail, the same objection made at
    trial in a case to be tried by a jury raises much more difficult problems.  Where the case turns on the witnesss
    credibility, it must be conceded that the jury will lose some information
    relevant to the witnesss credibility if the witness is allowed to wear her
    niqab.  The extent of that loss is open
    to debate.  However, in a jury case, it
    is the jurys obligation and no one elses to evaluate demeanour and determine
    the extent to which it impacts on the outcome.  Where the credibility of the witness is virtually determinative of the
    outcome, denying the jury full access to that witnesss demeanour could be seen
    as detracting from the accuseds right to trial by jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the application to require the witness to remove her niqab is brought in a jury
    trial, the judge must have regard to the jurys role as the ultimate trier of
    fact.  The jury must determine the
    significance of the witnesss demeanour.  The judge will also bear in mind, however, that the jury will have the
    benefit of his instructions with respect to the assessment of demeanour and the
    potential impact of the wearing of the niqab.  Those instructions will counter, to some degree, any prejudice to the
    defence ability to effectively cross-examine the witness.  Demeanour instructions would not, of course,
    make up any detriment to the cross-examination occasioned by the questioners
    inability to see the witnesss full face as she was being cross-examined. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no getting around the reality that in some cases, particularly those
    involving trial by jury, where a witnesss credibility is central to the
    outcome, a judge will have a difficult decision to make where the witness
    claims the constitutional right to wear her niqab while testifying.  There can be no doubt that judges who
    actually see the participants in the process are in a better position to make
    the sensitive determinations required than an appellate court.  Assuming the appropriate inquiry has been
    made, the proper constitutional principles applied, and the relevant factors
    properly considered, this court should show deference to the trial judges decision.  </p>

    by requiring the witness to remove the niqab, the niqab must be removed if the
    witness is to testify.  I would hope, however,
    that if the individual rights recognized in the <i>Charter</i> are treated as something more than additional weapons in
    the lawyers legal arsenal, the parties will engage in good faith efforts to
    reconcile competing interests and produce a satisfactory resolution that

    preliminary inquiry or before the Superior Court justice.  There is nothing in the record to suggest
    that but for her religious <span class=GramE>beliefs,</span> N.S. would have
    claimed the right to testify while wearing her niqab.  There are several provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which provide special
    protection for complainants when they testify in sexual assault cases (e.g. ss.
    486, 486.1, 486.2).  In a specific case,
    there may be an argument for protections beyond those specifically created by
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> for complainants in
    sexual assault cases.  No such argument,
    other than one based on N.S.s religious beliefs, was put forward at the

    leave those questions be resolved in cases in which they actually arise.  It may be for example the reconciliation of
