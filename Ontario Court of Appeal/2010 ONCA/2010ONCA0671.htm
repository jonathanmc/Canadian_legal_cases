  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Steven Carty and Fabian Vermont, and
    Fabian’s brother Daniel Vermont, were charged with the attempted murder of
    Dwayne Guy.  After an eight-day trial
    before Valin J. and a jury, Carty was found guilty of attempted murder.  Fabian and Daniel Vermont were found not
    guilty of attempted murder but guilty of the lesser included offence of
    aggravated assault.  Carty was sentenced
    to 8½ years’ imprisonment, less 2½ years’ credit for pre-trial custody.  Fabian and Daniel Vermont were each sentenced
    to 3½ years’ imprisonment, less credit for pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carty appeals his conviction on two grounds:  first, he submits that his conviction for
    attempted murder is unreasonable; and second, he submits that the trial judge
    erred in law in his charge to the jury by failing to put the position of the
    defence on the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted
    murder and the evidence supporting that position.  Carty asks the court to set aside the
    conviction for attempted murder, substitute a conviction for aggravated
    assault, and reduce his sentence to time served (4½ years, including the 2½
    years’ credit for pre-trial custody).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Carty’s second submission.  I would therefore set aside his conviction
    for attempted murder and, on the concurrence of both Carty and the Crown,
    substitute a conviction for aggravated assault.  I would reduce Carty’s sentence from 8½ years’ to 5½ years’ imprisonment,
    less 2½ years’ credit for pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fabian Vermont appeals his conviction on three
    grounds.  First, he submits that the
    trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on “aiding” because he left
    the jury with the impression that positive action was not required for a
    finding of guilt.  Second, he submits
    that the trial judge should not have left liability as an abettor with the
    jury.  Third, he submits that the trial
    judge erred by failing to relate the principles of party liability to the
    evidence capable of supporting a conviction for party liability.  Fabian Vermont asks that his conviction for
    aggravated assault be set aside and for a new trial.  I would not give effect to Fabian Vermont’s
    submissions and would therefore dismiss his conviction appeal.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    victim, Guy, was a drug dealer in North Bay.  In late 2005 he met the three accused, who, together, were in the
    business of selling cocaine.  For
    approximately two months, the four men lived together in a friend’s house from
    where they dealt drugs to the North Bay community.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    Guy’s business arrangement with the three accused ended in February 2006, when
    they proposed to raise the price of their cocaine.  Guy stopped living with Carty and the Vermont
    brothers, and stopped selling their cocaine.  At the time of their falling out, Guy owed the three accused $200.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    incident giving rise to the charges occurred shortly after the falling out.  In the early morning hours of March 8, on the
    pretext of giving him a ride home, another drug dealer associated with the three
    accused drove Guy to a dead-end cul-de-sac and parked beside another car.  Guy got out of the car in which he was
    driven.  Carty and Daniel Vermont got out
    of the other car.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Carty
    told Guy that he was very disappointed in him.  Daniel Vermont then struck Guy’s right knee with a hammer.  Carty put Guy in a headlock and said “shut up
    and take it like a man.”  Guy, however,
    escaped Carty’s grasp and started to run away.  He looked back and, as he did so, a man whom he later identified as Fabian
    Vermont, struck him with a baseball bat.  Carty then proceeded to stab Guy with a pocket knife, which had a three-
    to four-inch blade.  Carty slashed Guy’s
    face, stabbed his legs and arms, and stabbed him three times in the back – in
    total Carty inflicted seven stab wounds.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Eventually
    Carty and the Vermont brothers got back in their car.  As they did so, Guy stood up.  The three accused looked at him and then
    drove away.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Guy
    at first refused to identify his assailants.  He said that he did not know who had stabbed him.  However, in October 2006, seven months after
    the incident, while he was incarcerated on an unrelated matter, Guy identified
    the three accused as his assailants.  He
    said that he had not identified them earlier because he was afraid.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    trial, the Crown’s case hinged almost entirely on the evidence of Guy, who,
    during his evidence-in-chief, again identified the three accused as his
    assailants.  Guy was an admitted thief,
    liar and con man, so the trial judge properly gave the jury a strong <i>Vetrovec</i> warning about accepting his
    evidence.  There was, nonetheless, some
    corroborating evidence for his testimony.  </span></p>

    in his charge to the jury by failing to put the position of the defence and the
    evidence supporting that position?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many cases, both in the Supreme Court of Canada and
    provincial appellate courts, have discussed the trial judge’s duty in charging
    a jury in a criminal case.  A number of
    the important cases are reviewed in the majority reasons of Bastarache J. and
    the dissenting reasons of Fish J. in <i>R.
    v. Daley</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The overriding principle is fairness.  To ensure that the accused has a fair trial,
    two things that a trial judge must ordinarily do, but that this trial judge did
    not do, are tell the jury the position of the defence and the key evidence
    supporting that position.  Without these
    instructions a jury might not appreciate the significance of the evidence from
    the defence’s perspective:  see <i>Daley</i> at para. 19; <i>Pappajohn v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120 at p. 126.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The failure of a trial judge to so charge the jury does
    not always amount to a reversible error.  An appellate court may still be satisfied, after considering the charge
    as a whole and in the light of the closing arguments and positions of counsel,
    that the trial judge’s instructions were adequate; or that the Crown’s case was
    so overwhelming that the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury on the
    defence’s position and the evidence supporting it did not result in a
    miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge’s charge does not survive
    appellate scrutiny.  The trial judge did
    review for the jury, at some length, the evidence in this case.  He also charged the jury on the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for attempted murder.  He properly
    instructed them that the accused had to “mean to kill” Guy; “nothing less will
    do”.  But the trial judge did not instruct
    the jury on the evidence bearing on whether Carty had the intent to kill Guy or
    merely the intent to wound him.  He
    simply told the jury to “consider all the evidence” – “what he did or did not
    do, how he did it or did not do it and what he said or did not say.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then, when the trial judge instructed the jury on
    Carty’s position he told them only the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Steven Carty reminded you that he was and remains
    entitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence unless and until his
    guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  He invited you to scrutinize closely the evidence of Dwayne Guy and that
    following that scrutiny you should find that Mr. Guy was not a credible witness
    and that his testimony is not reliable.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Carty urged you to find that there is no
    evidence capable of supporting such an incredible and unreliable testimony.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He suggested that when you apply the judge’s
    instructions on the law to the findings of fact that you will make, you should
    have no difficulty concluding that the Crown has failed to prove his guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this place in his charge as well, the trial judge
    did not instruct the jury on the critical evidence supporting Carty’s claim
    that he did not have the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for attempted murder.  The trial judge’s failure to instruct the
    jury on Carty’s position that he intended to wound Guy not kill him, and on the
    evidence supporting his position, deprived Carty of a fair trial for two
    reasons.  First, as I have said, the
    Crown’s case on attempted murder was thin at best.  In his closing argument Crown counsel
    acknowledged the jury may have “difficulty” finding any of the accused guilty
    of attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Carty was self represented.  His closing address to the jury was very
    brief and said nothing about the evidence supporting his position.  All he said was this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Yeah.  I was
    just gonna be quick, Your Honour.  Innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  You heard of my pleading not guilty at the
    beginning, when the trial commenced.  Your
    Honour and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the evidence brought before you by
    Dwayne Guy is inconsistent, unreliable, and the Crown has failed to prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that myself or any of the accused were event [<i>sic</i>] at the scene of an assault.  I therefore urge you to find that there is a
    lack of grounds for these charges.  And,
    furthermore, take a good examination of the evidence and listen to any
    instructions that Your Honour might do.  I thank you for attending my trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet there were cogent pieces of evidence that cast
    doubt on whether Carty had the necessary intent to kill.  That evidence included the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although Guy owed Carty money, Guy admitted that
    Carty never threatened him;</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown acknowledges that the trial judge did not
    review the evidence relevant to the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for attempted murder or the
    evidence supporting Carty’s position that he did not have the intent to
    kill.  The Crown, nevertheless, contends
    that the trial judge’s failure to do so did not amount to reversible
    error.  She points to the absence of any
    objections to the charge from counsel for Daniel and Fabian Vermont and to the
    trial Crown’s closing argument in which he set out some of the evidence
    favouring Carty’s defence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot accept the Crown’s contention.  The failure of defence counsel for the
    Vermont brothers to object does not carry much weight.  Of the three accused, Carty was the one
    potentially most at risk to be convicted of attempted murder, and he did not
    have a lawyer to represent his position.  Although Crown counsel is to be commended for his closing argument, a
    counsel’s address does not have the force of instructions from the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without a summary from the trial judge of the key
    evidence supporting Carty’s position that he did not intend to kill Guy, I am
    not satisfied that the jury would have appreciated the cumulative strength of
    this evidence.  The trial judge’s failure
    to instruct the jury on Carty’s position and the evidence supporting it is an
    error in law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of this error in the trial judge’s charge and
    because the Crown’s case was far from overwhelming, Carty’s conviction for
    attempted murder cannot stand.  Ordinarily, the court would set aside this conviction and order a new
    trial.  However, both Carty and the Crown
    agree that if the conviction for attempted murder is set aside, the court
    should substitute a conviction for aggravated assault.  The court has the authority to do so, and the
    evidence certainly supports a conviction for aggravated assault:  see <i>R. v.
    Maciel</i> (2007), 219 C.C.C. (3d) 516 at paras. 98-99.  I would therefore dismiss Carty’s conviction
    appeal, but set aside the conviction for attempted murder and substitute a
    conviction for aggravated assault.</p>

    “apprentices”.  Carty also inflicted the
    most serious injuries in what was unquestionably a planned and vicious

    supporting a finding of guilt as a party.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    crux of Fabian Vermont’s submission on aiding is that the trial judge did not
    tell the jury that to be guilty of “aiding” under s. 21(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>, Fabian Vermont had to take an active step to assist in the
    assault on Guy.  In support of his
    submission, Fabian Vermont points out that Guy admitted to having only a
    fleeting glimpse of the person wielding the baseball bat, and agreed he did not
    see Fabian Vermont while he was being stabbed.  The crux of Fabian Vermont’s submission on abetting is that there was no
    evidence to suggest he instigated, promoted or encouraged the attack on Guy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    do not agree.  First, the force of Fabian
    Vermont’s submission is greatly diminished by the jury’s determination that he
    was not guilty of attempted murder.  It
    is highly likely that the jury found him guilty of aggravated assault as a
    principal, not as a party.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the trial judge told the jury that mere presence at the time of the offence was
    not sufficient to find an accused guilty of aiding or abetting.  For example, on his charge on aiding he said
    to the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    is not enough that a person was simply there when a crime was committed by
    someone else.  In other words, just being
    there does not make a person guilty as an aider of any or every crime somebody
    else commits in the person’s presence.  Sometimes, people are in the wrong place at the wrong time.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>The trial
    judge also told the jury that to be guilty of aiding, the accused “must intend
    to help the other person commit the offence.  Actual assistance is necessary.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    agree with the Crown that from these instructions there was no risk the jury
    would have convicted Fabian Vermont for simply being at the scene of the assault.  The jury would have understood that if they
    found Fabian Vermont was present at the scene but did not participate in the
    assault, he should be acquitted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    the inference that Fabian Vermont was the person who hit Guy with a baseball
    bat is compelling.  There was a lot of
    evidence that Fabian Vermont was at the scene of the assault and that the only
    others present were his brother Daniel, Carty and the victim, Guy.  The evidence was uncontradicted that Guy was
    hit with a hammer, stabbed with a knife and clubbed with a baseball bat.  The evidence was also uncontradicted that
    Daniel Vermont wielded the hammer and Carty used the knife.  Yet there is no evidence that either of these
    accused also wielded the bat.  The
    conclusion that Fabian Vermont did so is thus compelling.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
    liability as an abettor had an air of reality.  On the Crown’s theory, Fabian Vermont struck Guy with the bat as Guy was
    trying to escape, thus allowing the assault on him to continue.  In this sense, Fabian Vermont might be said
    to have encouraged, instigated or promoted the assault.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fifth,
    the trial judge’s failure to relate the evidence to the legal basis for liability
    as a party did not prejudice Fabian Vermont.  The jury found him not guilty of attempted murder and there was really
    no evidence that could have exonerated him of aggravated assault.</span></p>
