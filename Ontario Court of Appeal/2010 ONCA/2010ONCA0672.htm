  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the proper interpretation of a
    phrase in the definition of “current value” in the <i>Assessment Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>c</span>. A. 31 as
    applied to several large bank towers in downtown Toronto.  In an interim decision, the Assessment Review
    Board held that the phrase, “fee simple, if unencumbered”, required that the
    bank towers be valued as if they were vacant at the date of assessment.  The Divisional Court disagreed with that
    interpretation, holding that it was wrong in law.  I agree with the Divisional Court’s
    interpretation of the legislation.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal by the owners of the bank
    towers.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in this case is the proper manner of
    assessing for municipal tax purposes the bank tower properties.  The respondent Municipal Property Assessment
    Corporation (“MPAC”) assessed the combined current value of the bank towers at
    approximately $5 billion for the taxation years 2001 and 2002, based on a valuation
    date of June 30, 1999.  The owners of the
    bank towers challenged these assessments before the Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>All of the parties agreed that the proper method of assessing the bank
    towers was the so-called “income approach,” but they offered radically different
    views as to the assumptions to be made in applying this approach.  The different approaches were driven by
    different understandings of how to determine the “current value” of the
    properties as that term is defined in the <i>Assessment
    Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>Following over 60 days of hearings, the Board issued an interim decision in
    which it endorsed the owners’ interpretation of “current value” as it applied
    to the subject properties.  The Board
    instructed the parties to attempt to determine new assessment figures based
    upon its ruling.  MPAC and the City of
    Toronto appealed the interim decision, with leave, to the Divisional
    Court.  A coalition of 11 municipalities
    intervened to support the appellants’ position.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE LEGISLATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this appeal, the legislative scheme
    in the <i>Assessment Act </i>may be
    described as follows.  Subject to some
    exceptions that are not relevant in this case, all real property in Ontario is
    liable to assessment and taxation.  Land
    is assessed against the owner based on its current value.  “Current value” is defined in s. 1(1) of the
    Act as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&quot;<span class=GramE>current</span> value&quot;
    means, in relation to land, the amount of money the fee simple, if
    unencumbered, would realize if sold at arm's length by a willing seller to a
    willing buyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The term “land” is broadly defined in the same section
    and includes “all buildings, or any part of any building, and all structures,
    machinery and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under or affixed to
    land”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE INTERIM DECISION OF THE BOARD</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board gave extensive reasons for its interpretation
    of the phrase “fee simple, if unencumbered”.  It looked at the legislative history, decisions of this court and the
    Divisional Court, dictionary definitions of the terms, and definitions in legal
    texts on property and real estate appraisal. The Board also compared valuation
    under the <i>Assessment Act</i> with the
    approach taken under the <i>Expropriations
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>c</span>. E. 26.  In the end, the Board came to the conclusion
    that the “fee simple, if unencumbered” required that the only interests to be
    valued were those of the owners and that, for example, all leases in place at
    the time of the valuation had to be disregarded because they were encumbrances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, since the bank towers are income-producing
    properties, the Board further found that the current value had to take into
    account that the willing buyer was buying a building that would generate an
    income stream.  This in turn required a
    determination of market rent income, the deduction of various expenses to
    obtain that income, an allowance to reflect a stabilized vacancy over the
    economic life of the property, and the application of an overall capitalization
    rate to produce a value.  In effect, the
    assessment was to be based on the theory of a sale on the valuation date where
    the owner was giving vacant possession and then allowing for a notional two-year
    period during which the building would be leased up at market rents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the Board accepted the capitalization rate used by the owners&rsquo; expert of 8.75 per cent.  The Board rejected the approach taken by the respondents’ experts who
    used a capitalization rate of 8.75 per cent.  The difference in capitalization rates resulted in significantly
    different assessments. As an illustration, MPAC valued the Toronto-Dominion Centre
    at $1.439 billion, and the owners valued the same property at $1.014 billion, a
    difference of over $400 million.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court held that standard of review of
    the Board’s decision as to the interpretation of the definition of “current
    value” is correctness.  It found that the
    Board’s decision was incorrect.  The
    Court further held that if the more deferential standard of reasonableness
    applied, the Board’s decision was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court held that the purpose of the phrase “fee
    simple, if unencumbered” as applied to income-producing properties was to
    arrive at a value calculated without reference to leases at other than market
    value.  It was not, however, to be based
    on the wholly artificial notion that the buildings were vacant at the time of
    assessment.  The Court placed
    considerable emphasis on the intent of the Legislature in amending the Act in
    1997 in response to this court’s decision in <i>Re Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 11 and Nesse Holdings
    Ltd. et al.</i> (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 437.  It was the view of the Court that the 1997 amendments were intended to
    codify the dissent of Robins J.A. in <i>Nesse
    Holdings.</i>  The Court also relied upon
    this court’s recent decision in <i>Carsons’
    Camp Ltd. v. Municipal Property Assessment Corporation </i>(2008), 88 O.R. (3d)
    741, in support of its interpretation.  The Court accordingly allowed the appeal by MPAC and the City of Toronto
    and returned the matter to the Board to a differently-constituted panel.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise two issues in this court. First,
    they submit that the proper standard of review is reasonableness, having regard
    to the Board’s expertise in adjudicating complex questions of valuation.
    Second, they submit that the Divisional Court erred in its interpretation of
    the phrase “fee simple, if unencumbered” in the definition of “current value”
    in s. 1 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless of our disposition of these issues, the
    appellants also submit that the Divisional Court erred in directing that the
    matter be returned to a differently-constituted panel of the Board given the
    progress that has been made to date.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Standard of Review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is well-known, in <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick,</i> [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, the Supreme Court
    revisited and refined the approach to judicial review of administrative
    action.  The Court reduced the standards
    of review to the two of correctness and reasonableness.  Although the Court eliminated the highly
    deferential standard of patent unreasonableness, that change did not signal the
    need for a wholesale revisiting of the judicial review framework.  Rather, in a post-<i>Dunsmuir</i> case, the court should “ascertain whether the
    jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of
    deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of
    question”:  <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para. 62.  Only
    if this first inquiry was unfruitful would it be necessary to proceed to the
    analysis of the various factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If it becomes necessary to proceed to the second stage,
    the court will look at several factors.  The existence of a privative clause is a strong indication that the
    standard of review is reasonableness.  The reasonableness standard will also tend to be applied where the question
    is one of fact, discretion or policy, or “where the legal and factual issues
    are intertwined with and cannot be readily separated”:  <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para. 53.  Reasonableness will also
    usually be the standard “where a tribunal is interpreting its own statute or
    statutes closely connected to its function, with which it will have particular
    familiarity” or where the tribunal “has developed particular expertise in the
    application of a general common law or civil law rule in relation to a specific
    statutory context”: <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para.
    54.  On the other hand, the correctness
    standard will apply where the question of law is of central importance to the
    legal system and outside the tribunal’s specialized area of expertise:  <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para. 60.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para. 64, the Court summarized the second stage analysis as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The analysis must be contextual. As mentioned
    above, it is dependent on the application of a number of relevant factors,
    including: (1) the presence or absence of a privative clause; (2) the purpose
    of the tribunal as determined by interpretation of enabling legislation; (3)
    the nature of the question at issue, and; (4) the expertise of the tribunal. In
    many cases, it will not be necessary to consider all of the factors, as some of
    them may be determinative in the application of the reasonableness standard in
    a specific case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the pre-<i>Dunsmuir</i> jurisprudence has already determined the standard of review in a satisfactory
    manner.  In a series of cases, the
    Divisional Court has found that the standard of review on questions of law is
    correctness, even where the Board is interpreting its home statute.  See <i>Municipal
    Property Assessment Corp. v. Minto Developments Inc.</i> (2003), 2 M.P.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    89, and <i>1098748 Ontario Ltd. v. Ontario
    Property Assessment Corp., Region No. 11</i> (2001), 143 O.A.C. 121.  And the Divisional Court reached the same
    conclusion in the post-<i>Dunsmuir</i> decision in <i>Toronto (City) v. Wolf</i> (2008), 241 O.A.C. 41.  The Divisional
    Court pointed out in those cases the Board’s decisions are not protected by a
    privative clause and that there is a statutory appeal with leave to the
    Divisional Court on questions of law (s. 43.1 of the Act).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s own approach to the interpretation issue
    supports application of a standard of correctness.  The Board did not apply any particular
    specialized expertise, but rather approached the question as would a
    court.  It reviewed and analyzed
    decisions of this court and the Divisional Court going back to 1907 in an
    attempt to find the legal meaning of the phrase “fee simple, if
    unencumbered”.  I agree with the
    Divisional Court in this case that the standard of review is correctness.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Nesse Holdings</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> and the 1997 Amendments</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the Board, in the Divisional Court and in argument
    before this court much attention was paid to this court’s decision in <i>Nesse Holdings</i> and the effect of the
    subsequent amendments to the Act.  In <i>Nesse Holdings</i>, the court was required
    to consider the meaning of s. 18 of the former Act, which provided that <span
class=GramE>land</span> was to be assessed at its “market value”.  Section 18(2) defined market value as “the
    amount that the land might be expected to realize if sold in the open market by
    a willing seller to a willing buyer”.  In <i>Nesse Holdings,</i> the majority of the
    court looked solely at a recent sale of the property as the best evidence of
    market value, even though the property was subject to a lease with rents
    substantially below market rates.  Robins
    J.A. dissented.  He agreed that
    ordinarily a recent arm’s length sale will be the best evidence of market
    value, but not always.  In particular,
    “when the evidence establishes, as in this case, that the land is subject to
    leasehold interests at rentals significantly below current market rentals, the
    sale price cannot in and of itself establish the value of the land for the
    purposes of s. 18(2)”:  <i>Nesse Holdings</i> at pp. 441-2.  He held that while the sale price is evidence
    of the market value of the owner’s interest, the tenant’s interest much be
    included “in calculating the actual value of the land for assessment purposes”: <span class=SpellE><i>Nesse</i></span><i> Holdings </i>at p.&nbsp;442.  As Robins J.A. said at p. 442:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whether the sales or income method of valuation is
    employed, <i>the object of the exercise is
    to determine the actual or market value of the land for assessment purposes</i>.
    It seems to me highly incongruous to require that the tenants' interest be
    taken into account by basing the value of land on current market rents in the
    case of the income approach and at the same time to disregard the identical
    interest in the case of the sales approach. In my view, the tenants' interest
    should be included on either approach where there is a substantial disparity
    between actual and fair market rents. <i>It
    is the totality of the interests in the title to land which is to be valued in
    order to determine the market value at which the land is to be assessed</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, Robins J.A. relied upon
    the earlier decision of this court in <i>Re
    Cardinal Plaza Ltd. et al. and Regional Assessment Com'r, Region No. 19 et al.</i> (1984), 49 O.R. (2d) 161, where <span class=SpellE>Lacourcière</span> J.A. held
    at p. 163 “that an equitable assessment of multi-residential properties based
    on the income approach must necessarily use economic rents rather than actual
    rents”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interestingly, the majority of the court in <i>Nesse Holdings</i> held that if its
    interpretation of the statute was wrong the Legislature could speedily correct
    the matter since it “would take very little by way of amendment to extend or
    clarify the meaning of s. 18(2) if that is the intention”: <span class=SpellE><i>Nesse</i></span><i> Holdings</i> at p. 440.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Legislature did indeed amend the <i>Assessment Act</i>, albeit perhaps not as expeditiously
    as the majority contemplated.  Among
    other things, the 1997 amendments removed s. 17, which provided for separate
    assessments against the owner and tenant and provided a definition of current
    value.  A comparison of the definition of
    “market value” in the old Act and “current value” in the new Act is
    instructive:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>s</span>. 18(2) of the old
    Act:  </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span class=GramE>the</span> market value of
    the land assessed is the amount that the land might be expected to realize if
    sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>s</span>. 1(1) of the new Act:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>“<span class=GramE>current</span> value” means, in relation to land, the amount of money the fee simple, if
    unencumbered, would realize if sold at arm’s length by a willing seller to a
    willing buyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is apparent, the two definitions are almost
    identical, but for the inclusion of the phrase “fee simple, if unencumbered” in
    the new Act.  I agree with the Divisional
    Court that the intent of the 1997 amendments was to clarify that the approach as
    taken by Robins J.A. in <i>Nesse Holdings </i>and
    Lacourcière J.A. in <i>Re Cardinal Plaza
    Ltd. et al. and Regional Assessment Com'r, Region No. 19 et al.</i> was
    correct.  The simple amendment instructs
    the assessor to ignore encumbrances, such as leases that are not at market
    rents.  Where the income approach is
    taken, the assessor is, as held by Lacourcière J.A., to use market rents rather
    than actual rents.  I do not agree that
    this minor amendment was intended to accomplish the much more radical task of instructing
    the assessor to assume that an income-producing property was vacant at the date
    of assessment.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Carsons’ Camp</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with the Divisional Court that this
    court’s decision in <i>Carsons’ Camp </i>supports
    the view that what is to be assessed is the whole value of the land, including
    the value of market value leases.  In
    that case, the court held that trailers, owned by other persons, were
    nevertheless part of the property owner’s land and their value had to be
    included in the “current value” of the land for assessment purposes.  The Divisional Court correctly applied the
    reasoning from <i>Carsons’ Camp</i> to the
    facts of this case at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The same reasoning applies where ownership of
    interests in the land is divided by leasehold interests granted by the owner.
    This is supported by a contextual interpretation of the statutory provision.
    &quot;Current value&quot; is defined &quot;in relation to land&quot;. It
    matters not that portions of the land have been leased; undoubtedly the Bank
    Towers in issue here and the land upon which they are situate are land, as
    defined in the <i>Assessment Act</i>. The
    definition connotes a notion of market value in referring to &quot;the amount
    of money the fee simple . . . would realize if sold at arm's length by a
    willing seller to a willing buyer&quot;. For single family dwellings this will
    generally approach market value on the valuation date. To value these Bank
    Towers on the basis that they are vacant, when all agree that that is an
    entirely hypothetical scenario, is to significantly undervalue them compared to
    other real property and undermines the purpose of the <i>Assessment Act,</i> to fairly divide the burden of real property
    taxation. <i>The definition is in relation
    to &quot;value&quot;, and, in our view, &quot;fee simple, if unencumbered&quot;
    describes a valuation standard and does not limit the nature of the asset to be
    valued, which is the whole of the land. In the context of income-producing
    property, &quot;fee simple if unencumbered&quot; means value calculated without
    reference to leases at other than market value, a long-standing principle
    governing assessment of income-producing property, and corrects the anomaly
    referred to by Robins J.A. in … Nesse Holdings Ltd. </i>….  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.  The
    office towers are to be assessed in accordance with the income approach using
    market rents and allowing for only a normal vacancy rate, which I understand
    from the evidence to be 7 per cent.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ORDER TO BE MADE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with only one aspect of the Divisional
    Court’s decision.  I see no reason for
    returning the case to a differently-constituted panel of the Board.  The Board heard evidence and submissions over
    a 62-day period.  Many of the matters
    determined in the Interim Decision are unaffected by the legal error concerning
    the meaning of “fee simple, if unencumbered” and directly engaged the Board’s
    expertise in assessment matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal only to the very
    limited extent that the matter should be returned to the same panel of the
    Board.  The respondents are entitled to
    their costs which I would fix at $50,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.
    to be divided equally between MPAC and the City of Toronto.</p>
