    decision of the Superior Court of Justice finding that it breached a franchise
    agreement with the respondents.  The
    trial judge found that the franchise agreement provided the respondents with a
    conditional right of renewal and that the appellant denied them this right.  She awarded damages for breach of contract, breach
    of the duty of good faith and mental distress.  I agree with the trial judge’s reasons and find no error in her decision.  I would dismiss the appeal.  My reasons follow.</span></p>
  <p class=Sectionheading><span style='line-height:
200%'>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the fall of 2001, the respondent <span class=SpellE>Abdulhamid</span> <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> (“Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span>”) entered
    into a franchise agreement with Timothy’s to operate a franchise store in the <span
class=SpellE>Bayshore</span> Shopping Centre in Ottawa.  Timothy’s was a lessee under a head lease for
    a location on the third floor in the shopping centre.  When Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> entered into the franchise agreement, he became a <span class=SpellE>sublessee</span> under the head lease.  There were only four
    years remaining on the head lease, which was set to expire on September 30,
    2005.  The term of the franchise
    agreement was tied to the length of the head lease. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> was concerned about the
    short term of the lease and the franchise agreement, given the amount of his
    investment in purchasing the franchise and setting up operations.  In response to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah’s</span> concerns about the term, Timothy’s proposed the inclusion of Schedule “A” in
    the franchise agreement.  Schedule “A”
    provided that in the event that Timothy’s entered into a new head lease with
    the <span class=SpellE>Bayshore</span> Shopping Centre, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah’s</span> franchise agreement would be renewed with a new sublease.  In the event that the new head lease was to
    be for a period of less than five years, there would be no additional franchise
    fee payable by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span>.  If the new head lease was for a period of
    more than five years, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> would be required to
    pay an amount equal to 50% of the then current franchise fee. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Concurrent with the execution of the franchise agreement, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> assigned the agreement, the sublease, and the
    general security agreement to his newly incorporated company 1470256 Ontario
    Inc. (“147”) by way of an Assignment and Guarantee.  This was permitted by Timothy’s, but with the
    condition expressed in the Assignment and Guarantee that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Salah</span> remained personally liable for all franchisee
    obligations under the franchise agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Prior to September 30, 2005, the expiry date of the head
    lease on the third floor, Timothy’s entered into a new lease on the second
    floor and signed an agreement with a new franchisee for that location.  The appellant then advised Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Salah</span> that his franchise agreement would come to an end on
    September 30, 2005.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Salah</span> and 147 commenced proceedings against Timothy’s
    alleging breach of the franchise agreement and seeking damages arising both
    from the breach and from the appellant’s conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At trial, Timothy’s argued that the respondents had no right
    of renewal and that the parties had intended the franchise agreement to end
    with the expiry of the head lease on September 30, 2005.  It submitted that any right of renewal
    provided by Schedule “<span class=GramE>A</span>” only concerned the original
    location on the third floor of the shopping centre.  Since the appellant could not renew its head lease
    on the third floor, the provisions of Schedule “A” were inoperative.  Timothy’s also argued that because Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Salah</span> had assigned his franchisee rights to 147, only that
    corporation could bring a claim against the franchisor. </span></p>

    held as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

class=SpellE>Bayshore</span> Shopping Centre;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=Subsectionheading>            <span
class=SpellE>i</span>.          Treating
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> and 147 as one entity</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in failing to
    distinguish Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> from his corporation, 147.  Since a corporation is a distinct entity from
    its owner, and since Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> assigned the franchise
    agreement to 147, the appellant submits that only the corporate franchisee
    could assert contractual rights against the franchisor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I cannot accede to that submission.  There was ample evidence to support the trial
    judge’s finding that the appellant “maintained a relationship with both the
    individual franchisee and its assignee corporation.  It never intended to accept the corporation
    in the place of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> for all purposes.” While
    the franchisor allowed Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> to assign the
    franchise agreement to 147, one of the main purposes of the Assignment and
    Guarantee was to ensure that all obligations under the franchise agreement
    continued to be those of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> personally.  In addition, as noted by the trial judge, the
    concluding words of s. 4 of the Assignment and Guarantee state as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>Furthermore and without restricting the
    generality of the foregoing, the assignor shall continue to be personally bound
    by any and all provisions of the franchise agreement related to confidentiality
    and non-competition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Indeed, the business model of Timothy’s, as reflected in its
    franchise agreement, was to treat a corporate franchisee and its personal owner
    as one and the same.  To this effect, clause
    19.19 of the agreement provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the
    event that there is more than one Franchisee, or if the Franchisee should
    consist of more than one legal
    entity, the Franchisee’s liability hereunder shall be both joint and several.  A breach hereof by one such entity or
    Franchisee shall be deemed to be a breach by both or all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Moreover, it is revealing and significant that Timothy’s June
    8, 2005 letter—in which Timothy’s informed the franchisee that the franchise agreement
    would not be renewed—was addressed to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> personally, and not to the corporate respondent.  The <i>de
    facto</i> relationship under the franchise agreement was between Timothy’s and
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge concluded that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> and his corporation were one entity for the purposes of the franchise agreement.  Accordingly, she held that to deny Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Salah</span> a remedy on the basis of separateness would yield a
    result “too flagrantly opposed to justice”: see <span class=SpellE><i>Kosmopoulos</i></span><i> v. Constitution Insurance Co.</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 2, at p. 10.  I agree with her conclusion.  In the context of this dispute between
    franchisor and franchisee, it would be incongruous, not to mention unfair to
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span>, if he and his corporation were treated as
    one entity for the purposes of franchise liabilities, but were treated as separate
    entities when the question of enforcing franchisee rights under the franchise
    agreement is at issue.  </span></p>
  <p class=Subsectionheading>            ii.         Interpretation of the franchise agreement</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Timothy’s submission that the trial judge improperly
    construed Schedule “A” as providing an “option to amend” the franchise
    agreement is an attempt to ground an appeal on a statement taken out of context
    in the reasons for the decision.  Read as
    a whole, it is clear that the trial judge was engaged in an analysis of the
    contract between the parties, and the rights and obligations conferred by its
    terms.  The argument fails on this basis
    alone.  Moreover, there was no error in
    the approach adopted by the trial judge in construing the agreement before
    her.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The basic principles of commercial contractual
    interpretation may be summarized as follows.  When interpreting a contract, the court aims to determine the intentions
    of the parties in accordance with the language used in the written document and
    presumes that the parties have intended what they have said.  The court construes the contract as a whole,
    in a manner that gives meaning to all of its terms, and avoids an
    interpretation that would render one or more of its terms ineffective.  In interpreting the contract, the court must
    have regard to the objective evidence of the “factual matrix” or context
    underlying the negotiation of the contract, but not the subjective evidence of
    the intention of the parties.  The court
    should interpret the contract so as to accord with sound commercial principles
    and good business sense, and avoid commercial absurdity.  If the court finds that the contract is
    ambiguous, it may then resort to extrinsic evidence to clear up the
    ambiguity.  Where a transaction involves
    the execution of several documents that form parts of a larger composite

    third floor was the head lease between the <span class=SpellE>Bayshore</span> Shopping Centre and Timothy’s.  The
    appellant contends that the trial judge failed to take the head lease into
    account in her analysis.  I do not agree.  A review of her reasons demonstrates
    otherwise.  <span class=SpellE>Moreoever</span>,
    to the extent that any discrepancy exists between the head lease and the
    franchise agreement, I agree with the trial judge that the franchise agreement
    should be interpreted <i>contra <span
class=SpellE>proferentem</span></i>.  The
    head lease had been negotiated by Timothy’s with the landlord, and its terms
    were obviously known to Timothy’s at the time it drafted Schedule “A”.   Timothy’s had the opportunity to limit the
    scope of Schedule “A” to the third floor premises and either chose not to do so
    or was aware that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> would not have accepted
    such a limitation.  In either event,
    there is no basis to find that the trial judge committed a reviewable error.  Her conclusions that the franchise agreement
    and Schedule “A” applied to the whole shopping centre and that Timothy’s
    conduct—which effectively amounted to a refusal to allow Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Salah</span> the option of renewing the franchise agreement—constituted
    a breach of contract are unassailable.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Interpretation</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>(3)</b>        For the purpose of this

    expiration of the franchise agreement could not constitute a breach of the duty
    of good faith because s. 3(1) of the <span class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i> only
    imposes the duty of good faith and fair dealing in the “performance or enforcement”
    of the existing franchise agreement.  In
    other words, the appellant would have it that a terminated agreement is not
    caught by the section.  In my view, it is
    unnecessary in this case to consider the full scope of the words “performance
    or enforcement” as used in the <span class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i>.  The premise underlying the appellant’s
    submission has been negated by the trial judge’s interpretation of the
    agreement between the parties and the effect of Schedule “A”.  On the facts as found by the trial judge,
    there can be no doubt that the conduct at issue arises squarely within the
    “performance or enforcement” of the franchise agreement.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    in the trial judge’s conclusion that Schedule “A” applies to the whole shopping
    centre and that the right of renewal was triggered, the appellant’s submission
    on the effect of s. 3(2) of the <span class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i> cannot
    succeed.</span></p>

    lease of the third floor location and was negotiating a new lease on the second
    floor, the evidence showed that the franchisor deliberately kept Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Salah</span> in the dark about its intentions.  The trial judge found that “Mr. Black [the
    senior vice-president of development at Timothy’s]  
    e-mailed <span class=SpellE>Bayshore</span> Shopping Centre representatives
    asking them to refrain from passing on any information about the second floor
    location to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span>”.  The trial judge made further factual findings
    that Timothy’s “actively sought to keep the franchisee from finding out what
    was going on with the lease” and that Timothy’s deliberately withheld “critical
    information and did not return calls”.  These
    findings of fact more than support the conclusion that there was a breach of
    the duty of good faith that franchisors owe franchisees under s. 3(1) of the <span
class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i>.</span></p>

    flowing from the breach of contract, and (2) damages for the breach of the duty

    expert, who calculated the loss of profits only to 147, and the opinion of the
    respondents’ expert, who assessed the losses to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> and 147 collectively.  As the trial judge
    decided to treat Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> and his corporation as one
    and the same, it was open to her to prefer the evidence of the respondents’
    expert, which took into account the loss of income to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> as a result of the breach.  I would not
    interfere with this decision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    to award damages under the <span class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i> for
    anything other than compensatory damages relating to pecuniary losses.  In other words, it is not open to a trial
    judge to award damages under the head of compensatory damages relating to
    non-pecuniary losses, or under exemplary or punitive damages.  It argues that any damages flowing from the
    breach of the duty of good faith is limited to lost profits, and in particular
    the lost profits, if any, of 147.  The latter
    point is addressed above.  The trial
    judge treated Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> and 147 as a single entity
    for the purpose of determining losses flowing from the breach of contract and,
    on the <span class=GramE>evidence,</span> she was entitled to do so.</span></p>

    respect to the limitations applicable to damage awards under s. 3(2) of the <span
class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i> is misconceived.  The <span class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i> is<i> sui generis </i>remedial legislation.  It deserves a broad and generous
    interpretation.  The purpose of the statute
    is clear: it is intended to redress the imbalance of power as between
    franchisor and franchisee; it is also intended to provide a remedy for abuses
    stemming from this imbalance.  An
    interpretation of the statute which restricts damages to compensatory damages
    related solely to proven pecuniary losses would fly in the face of this policy
    initiative. </span></p>

class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i> against a party that has breached
    the duty of good faith and fair dealing is meant to ensure that franchisors
    observe their obligations in dealing with franchisees.  In that regard, the conduct that the trial
    judge found egregious in the present case is precisely the mischief that this
    legislation was enacted to remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    faith between contracting parties in general.  However, by enacting legislation that addresses the particular
    relationship between franchisors and franchisees, the legislature has clearly
    indicated that such relationships give rise to special considerations, both in
    terms of the duties owed and the remedies that flow from a breach of those
    duties.  This is evident in the wording
    of s. 3(2), which focuses on the conduct of the breaching party and not injury
    to the other side.  The trial judge’s
    award of damages was informed by these considerations.   </span></p>

    3(2) of the <span class=SpellE><i>Wishart</i></span><i> Act</i> permits an award of damages for the
    breach of the duty of good faith, separate and in addition to any award in
    compensation of pecuniary losses.  I
    would go further to say that any such award must be commensurate with the
    degree of the breach or offending conduct in the particular circumstances.  Taking the conduct of the appellant as found
    by the trial judge into account, I see no error in her decision to award
    damages on a merged basis for the breach of duty of good faith and mental
    distress, either in principle or in respect of quantum.  In my view, her findings as to the breach of
    duty of good faith alone would support the amount of the award.</span></p>

    argument advanced by the appellant.  The
    trial judge found that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Salah</span> and 147 should be
    treated as one entity with regard to the franchise agreement.  As noted above, there was ample evidence to
    support this finding.  Having done so,
    she was entitled thereafter to treat the pleadings of one as the pleadings of
    the other.  <span style='line-height:200%'>This is a complete answer to the appellant’s argument.  </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect
