    Greenglasses enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle.  Ms. Greenglass taught school, albeit part-time, while the children were
    young.  Mr. Greenglass, a chartered
    accountant, was a successful property manager for Brad-Jay Investments Limited
    and Village Investments.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    1999, the Greenglasses’ lives changed drastically when Mr. Greenglass was fired
    over allegations of wrongdoing. As a result, Ms. Greenglass returned to work as
    a teacher, having retired a year earlier at the age of 52.  She continued to work until February 2007.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    between Mr. Greenglass and his employers ensued (the “Brad-Jay litigation”).
    The Brad-Jay claim against Mr. Greenglass was for $4.8 million. He
    counterclaimed for $4 million.  There was
    a cross-claim against another party for $400,000 for wrongful dismissal and
    $4.25 million in other damages, and another cross-claim for $3.25 million in
    damages.  At trial, all claims were
    dismissed; Brad-Jay appealed the main claim, but Mr. Greenglass chose not to
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    litigation was hard-fought.  In the end,
    Mr. Greenglass was successful – at trial, in the Court of Appeal, and in
    resisting the application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.  By the time the proceedings ended in 2007,
    Mr. Greenglass had paid legal fees of close to $1 million.  He recovered some of these fees in cost
    awards in his favour. His net fees totalled $564,640.</span></p>

    the course of the Brad-Jay litigation, Mr. Greenglass received two offers to
    settle, first for $2.5 million, and later for $1.5 million.  Both offers assumed, in effect, Mr.
    Greenglass’s guilt with respect to the missing funds.  It was generally acknowledged that the first
    of these offers would have wiped out, in substantial part, the family’s
    assets.  It was the opinion of Karen
    Knudsen, Mr. Greenglass’s lawyer in the Brad-Jay litigation, that the case
    would not settle unless Mr. Greenglass essentially gave the plaintiffs
    everything they were asking for.  </span></p>

    the divorce proceedings, Ms. Greenglass sought, among other things, child
    support for their youngest child, retroactive and ongoing spousal support, and
    an unequal division of net family property.  Mr. Greenglass, in his counter-petition, claimed, in addition to other
    relief, an order for an equalization payment to his wife in the amount of $766,307.94.</span></p>

    October 9, 2003, Hamilton J. ordered Mr. Greenglass to advance to Ms.
    Greenglass $60,000 per year from June 2002 through October 2007 by way of
    monthly payments of $5,000.   These
    payments that Mr. Greenglass made to Ms. Greenglass ceased when the Brad-Jay
    litigation ended, in accordance with Hamilton J.’s order.  By that time, Mr. Greenglass had paid
    approximately $363,000 to Ms. Greenglass.</span></p>

    a lengthy trial, the trial judge ordered an equalization payment to Ms.
    Greenglass in the amount of $1,031,323.74, reduced by a credit to Mr.
    Greenglass of $363,000, leaving a total owing by him to Ms. Greenglass of
    $668,323.74.  These amounts were
    calculated on the basis of the following analysis. The trial judge found that
    on the date of valuation, Ms. Greenglass held total assets of $795,706.41 and
    total debts and liabilities of $15,276.11, and Mr. Greenglass held total assets
    of $3,129,230.71 and total debts and liabilities of $286,152.93.  The net family property was found to be
    $780,430.30 for Ms. Greenglass and $2,843,077.78 for Mr. Greenglass.  </span></p>

    trial judge also awarded retroactive spousal support of $126,900 to July 2009,
    ongoing monthly spousal support in the amount of $1,416.67 from August 1, 2009,
    reviewable at reasonable intervals, and ordered the execution of documents
    relating to the transfer of a timeshare and of an insurance policy.  She also ordered Mr. Greenglass to pay costs
    in the amount of $67,500.</span></p>

    Mr. Greenglass challenges virtually every aspect of the judgment, in terms of
    financial impact, the main issue in this appeal is the trial judge’s treatment
    of the future contingent legal costs associated with the Brad-Jay litigation in
    the calculation of his net family property (“NFP”).  </span></p>

    my view, the trial judge erred in several respects having to do with division
    of assets and spousal support, many of which Ms. Greenglass’s counsel fairly
    concedes, and I would allow the appeal in respect to those issues.  With respect to the remaining issues, I would
    not interfere with the discretion exercised by the trial judge and would

    various claims (main, counter and cross), the likelihood of an appeal, the

    trial judge determined that it was inappropriate to impute income to Mr.
    Greenglass based on a higher rate of return than he had actually received on
    his investments. She relied on Mr. Greenglass’s financial statement instead,
    which in November 2008 suggested a rate of return on his investments of 1.8
    percent. Mr. Greenglass submits that when calculating Ms. Greenglass’s return
    on her investments, this court should apply a rate of return of 3 percent. The
    same rate of return should be applied to both parties. I would apply a rate of
    2 percent as a reasonable rate a prudent investor might be able to earn at the
    relevant time, in order to determine the income that should be imputed to the Greenglasses
    from their respective investments.</span></p>

    were limited, at the time of trial, to $228 per month from her pension and $528
    per month from C.P.P. which, taken together with her imputed potential
    investment income, yield a total yearly income of $33,093.37.  At the time of the trial, Mr. Greenglass was
    earning employment income of $12,000 per year, plus $1,200 per year in bonuses.
    He also receives a pension of $503 per month and $615 per month from C.P.P.
    Therefore, his total income, together with that imputed from investments, is
    $67,158.90.</span></p>

    the other adjustments made to reflect errors in the trial judgment have no
    material impact on the parties’ means, I now turn to the issue of spousal
    support.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    parties are apparently content to rely on the SSAG for the purpose of assisting
    the court in the determination of spousal support.  The suggested range in these circumstances is
    37.5 percent to 50 percent of the difference between the parties’ gross
    incomes.  I agree with the trial judge
    that in the circumstances of this case spousal support should be awarded at the
    higher end of this range.   As the trial
    judge found, this was a long-term marriage and Ms. Greenglass’s career was
    affected by the responsibilities she assumed at home raising the two
    children.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    this percentage results in a monthly payment of $1419.40. The SSAG state that
    support payments should be capped at the amount that would result in the
    equalization of the parties’ net disposable income. In the circumstances of
    this case, where most of the parties’ income is imputed investment income, it
    is not possible to definitively determine the parties’ net disposable income.
    However, despite this uncertainty, I would adjust the monthly payments so as to
    account for the net income cap suggested in the SAGG. Therefore, while necessarily
    something of an estimated figure, I would order Mr. Greenglass to pay Ms.
    Greenglass monthly support in the amount of $1400. </span></p>

    is somewhat ironic that the support calculation results in almost the same
    amount as that which was ordered by the trial judge.  However, the recalculation of the division of
    assets and the use of the same projected rate of return for both parties on
    their investments, affect the income calculation in relation to both Mr. and
    Mrs. Greenglass. My ultimate conclusion that Ms. Greenglass is entitled to
    $1,400 per month in spousal support is the amount that I have determined to be
    appropriate after making the various adjustments required to correct the trial
    judge’s errors.</span></p>

    did not, as suggested by Mr. Greenglass, include either the costs award below
    or the lump sum retroactive spousal support payment in my calculation of Ms.
    Greenglass’s assets. In my opinion, it is not appropriate to include these
    payments in the calculation of the parties’ means.  The costs award should not be considered as
    part of Ms. Greenglass’s asset portfolio available to generate income.  The award is to assist her in paying the
    costs she has incurred in the litigation and is calculated when all other
    issues have been determined.  It makes no
    sense to include it in the calculation of NFP. Similarly, an amount owing
    pursuant to a retroactive support payment is not appropriately considered part
    of the NFP calculation since it is not property owned by the spouse at the
    valuation date.  </span></p>
