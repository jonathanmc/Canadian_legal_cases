  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Szewczyks and the Shennans are the owners of
    adjoining properties in Sauble Beach, Ontario, fronting onto Lake Huron.  For convenience, we shall refer to the
    properties as Lots 15 (the southerly lot owned by the Shennans) and 16 (the
    northerly lot owned by the Szewczyks). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues giving rise to this appeal flow from a
    dispute over the ownership of a 2.6 foot wide strip of land running along the
    boundary of the two properties, but located entirely on Lot 15.  The strip of land consists of a three-tiered
    area of sand and grass, and a raised flower bed and shrubbery structure
    surrounded by a concrete block retaining wall that appears to be about
    knee-high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the appeal, the Szewczyks seek to set aside the
    order of Justice R.M. Thompson of the Superior Court of Justice dismissing
    their assertion of adverse possession, holding that they have no interest in the
    disputed strip, and granting related relief.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lot 15 was acquired by Dr. George Stull in 1947 and Lot
    16 by his wife in 1954.  The Stull family
    used both properties as a joint vacation property until Dr. Stull’s death in
    1962, making no distinction between the two lots.  Dr. Stull liked to putter and to build, and
    he erected, renovated or moved several structures on the two properties over
    the years, including the grass/flower bed/shrubbery area and structure which is
    in dispute here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After his death, the Stull estate sold Lot 15 and,
    ultimately, it ended up in the hands of the Shennans in 1988.  Lot 16 remained in Mrs. Stull’s hands until
    her death and was sold to Mrs. Szewczyk in 1997.  The Szewczyks claim to have had exclusive
    possession of the disputed lands from 1997 to 2005, when the neighbours began
    to assert their respective rights, and they assert that their predecessors in
    title, the Stulls, occupied the strip of land to the exclusion of the Shennans and
    their predecessors in title during the years prior to that (sufficient to
    establish 10 years of adverse possession).  They also allege that the members of the Stull family themselves were
    mutually mistaken about the location of the boundary between the two
    properties, believing that it ran along the Lot 15 side of the disputed strip.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2002, Mr. Shennan commissioned a survey of the
    properties.  It confirmed that the
    disputed lands were on Lot 15.  In the
    meantime, however, the Szewczyks had constructed a new retaining wall,
    re-erected an old mailbox, planted extensively in the flower bed and erected a
    fence over a portion of the strip.  But
    the Shennans also made some use of the lands during this time as well.  In 2007, the Shennans commenced the present
    application for a declaration that the Szewcyks had no interest in the disputed
    strip and an injunction requiring them to remove any structures they had placed
    there.  They succeeded at trial.</p>
  <h3>The Trial Judge’s Decision and Findings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that during the period when the
    Stulls owned both properties they roamed across the two lots without any
    consideration for or thought given to where the boundary lines were.  There was no mistake as to where the boundary
    line was; nobody cared, he concluded.  He
    also found (i) that during the time in which the Shennans and the Stulls were
    neighbours, the two families both used and maintained the disputed strip of
    land and that they had a good relationship; (ii) that neither neighbour took
    any step to exclude the other from the strip; and (iii) that prior to the Szewczyk
    acquisition, none of the neighbours occupying either Lot 15 or Lot 16 had taken
    any steps to exclude the other neighbour’s access to the disputed strip.  Again, he found that this was not a case of
    two parties being mutually mistaken as to the location of a boundary.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This situation is about
    neighbours who knew generally where lot 15 ended and lot 16 started, but none
    of them were particularly concerned about delineating where that location
    was.  It simply wasn’t important to know
    where the exact boundary was because no one cared.  The boundary didn’t define the relationship
    between the neighbours.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the post-1997 period when the <span
class=SpellE>Szewczyks</span> owned Lot 16, the trial judge found that Mr.
    Szewczyk knew that the strip of land was not on his property and in fact
    belonged to the Shennans, and that Mr. Szewczyk engaged in an exercise of
    “creating facts” in support of the <span class=SpellE>Szewczyks</span>’ claim
    by carrying out the activities recited above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because there was no evidence, in the trial judge’s
    view, of acts by the Stulls to exclude the Shennans, or their predecessors in
    title, from the use of the disputed strip, the Szewczyks’ allegation of
    exclusive possession for a period of only 8 years – even if accepted – was
    insufficient to establish a claim for adverse possession.  He therefore ruled in favour of the Shennans.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contest the trial judge’s findings of
    fact on several grounds and argue that he erred in law by failing to give
    effect to the test for adverse possession that applies in cases of mutual
    mistake regarding the disputed boundary line.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to any of these submissions.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Factual
    Findings</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the attack on the judge’s factual
    findings, we can find no palpable and overriding error on the part of the trial
    judge.  Mr. Oldfield argues that the
    trial judge failed to address and give effect to the evidence of Cheryl Bailey,
    the Stull’s daughter who was familiar with the use of the property during her
    growing-up years and then through regular visits until her mother’s stroke in
    1987 and, thereafter, through her experience living on the property and being
    the person primarily responsible for its upkeep.  He also submits that the trial judge erred in
    failing to consider the pattern of use of the disputed strip and in finding
    that there were no acts of exclusion by the Stull family. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that the trial judge’s reasons, read
    as a whole, reflect that he was alive to Ms. Bailey’s testimony, even though he
    made no specific reference to her evidence.  Indeed, when he observed that during the period when the Stull family
    owned both Lots “they roamed across the two lots without any consideration as
    to where the actual boundary between lots 15 and 16 was,” and that over the
    years “none of [the neighbours] were particularly concerned about delineating
    where [the boundary] was”, he was paraphrasing her evidence very closely,
    although he made no specific attribution to her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is nothing in his findings that is
    incompatible with what Ms. Bailey said.  For example, she conceded on cross-examination that up until the time
    she sold the property (as executrix of her mother’s estate) nobody was
    concerned about the property lines at all because it was not important until
    the dispute arose.  She also stated that
    she was not aware of any occasion on which her neighbours ever wanted to make
    any use of the boundary area that was denied by the Stulls. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons also demonstrate that the trial judge was
    well aware of the pattern of use of the disputed strip from the time of its
    construction by Dr. Stull to the time the dispute arose between the
    parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was ample evidence to support the trial judge’s
    findings in all these respects, including his adverse credibility finding that Mr.
    Szewczyk attempted to “create facts” to support the Szewczyks’ claim.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Law</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did the trial judge err applying the law respecting
    adverse possession, in our view.  Generally,
    to establish adverse possession, the claimant must show (a) actual possession
    throughout the statutory period (here, 10 years by virtue of s. 4 of the <i>Real Property Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. L.15, s. 4); (b) the intention to exclude the true owner from
    possession or use to which the true owner intended to put the land during that
    period; and (c) effective exclusion of the true owner throughout the statutory
    period: <i>Bellini Custom Cabinetry Ltd. v.
    Delight Textiles Ltd., </i>2007 ONCA 413, at <span class=SpellE>para</span> 32.  Mr. Oldfield argues, however, that
    the “inconsistent use” criterion – (b) above – does not apply in cases of
    mutual mistake, and that the trial judge erred in ignoring that law in the
    circumstances: see <i>Teis v. <span
class=SpellE>Ancaster</span> (Town) </i>(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 216 (C.A.), at p. 224; <i>Key v. <span class=SpellE>Latsky</span></i> (2006), 206 O.A.C. 116, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not ignore that law.  He met the question of mutual mistake head on
    and found as a fact that this was not a case of mutual mistake.  As we have indicated, he was justified in
    making that finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the criterion of effective exclusion of
    the true owner throughout the 10-year period remains a requirement, even in
    cases of mutual mistake.  We do not read
    the decisions of this Court in <i>Key </i>and <i>Teis</i> as reading the “effective
    exclusion of the true owner” criteria out of the adverse possession
    requirements in cases involving mutual mistake.  <span class=GramE>Neither case dealt with the effective exclusion
    requirement, and</span> nothing was said in the reasons of the Court in either
    case to rule it out in cases of mutual mistake. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence that no one attempted to exclude <u>the Stulls</u> from using the strip does not meet this criterion.   On the
    trial judge’s findings, which were open to him on the record, there was no
    evidence of <u>the Shennans or their predecessors in title</u> – the true
    owners of the paper title – having been excluded from the use of the disputed
    strip. That is what was required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the 10-year period of adverse possession could
    not have begun to run until at least 1997, when the Szewczyks acquired Lot 16.  Even accepting their claim to exclusive
    possession of the disputed strip from that point on – which the trial judge did
    not accept – it was by then too late.</p>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents are entitled to their costs of the
    appeal, fixed in the amount of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and all
    applicable taxes, as agreed by counsel.</p>
