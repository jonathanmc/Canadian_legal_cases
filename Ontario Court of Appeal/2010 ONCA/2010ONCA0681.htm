  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Must
    confidential mediation and settlement records involving a government
    institution be disclosed, if sought under the <i>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. F.31, as amended (<i>FIPPA</i>)?  In my view, the answer to that question is
    “no”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      Between 1996 and 2003, the Magnotta
    companies (Magnotta) and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) were
    involved in litigation consisting of two judicial review applications and five
    defamation actions.  Two of the
    defamation actions were subject to case management and mandatory mediation
    under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 194, as amended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Between
    1997 and 2000, the LCBO and Magnotta made several efforts to resolve all of the
    litigation between them by means of mediation and informal settlement
    attempts.  These efforts were not
    successful.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      In
    2000, the LCBO and Magnotta arranged to mediate all of the litigation in a
    single mediation.  To participate, the
    parties were required to execute a mediation agreement containing the usual
    confidentiality provision.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Prior
    to the mediation, the parties filed mediation briefs and other materials.  The filed documents included confidential,
    highly sensitive and privileged information.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    LCBO intended to use all of its filed materials in the mediation and, if the
    mediation were unsuccessful, in other aspects of the ongoing litigation between
    the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      The LCBO and Magnotta succeeded in
    reaching a mediated settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      For the balance of 2000 and most of 2001,
    counsel for the parties worked to draft Minutes of Settlement and then finalise
    and implement their terms.  The executed
    Minutes of Settlement contain extensive confidentiality provisions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      The LCBO then received a request under <i>FIPPA </i>from an unidentified person (the
    Requester).  The Requester sought access
    to the complete record of the mediated settlement, including copies of all agreements
    pertaining to the settlement, the Minutes of Settlement and all related
    documentation (the Records).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The LCBO granted partial access to the Records
    but, based on exemptions in <i>FIPPA</i>,
    denied access to the remainder (the Disputed Records).  The Disputed Records included material that
    had been prepared for the mediation by Magnotta and which was in the LCBO’s
    possession.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Magnotta, as an affected party, also opposed the
    release of the Disputed Records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Requester appealed the LCBO’s decision to
    the Information and Privacy Commissioner (the IPC).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The IPC allowed the appeal and ordered the LCBO
    to disclose the Disputed Records to the Requester (subject to a number of
    deletions that are not in issue on this appeal).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The LCBO requested a reconsideration.  In a further order, the IPC dismissed the
    reconsideration request.  It ruled, among
    other things, that mediation is not litigation for the purposes of s. 19 of <i>FIPPA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The LCBO applied for judicial review of the IPC
    orders.  Magnotta supported the LCBO.  The Attorney General of Ontario intervened.  It, too, supported the LCBO.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>T</span>he
    Divisional Court allowed the application for judicial review and restored the
    LCBO’s decision to withhold the Disputed Records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The IPC appeals.  It submits that the Divisional Court erred in reasoning and result.  Its appeal is largely founded on the absence
    of an express statutory exemption for settlement privilege in <i>FIPPA</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The LCBO, Magnotta and the Attorney General of Ontario
    all contend that the Divisional Court decision is correct, both in result and
    reasoning.  They ask that the appeal be
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DIVISIONAL COURT DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Carnwath J., writing for the Divisional Court,
    gave thoughtful, detailed reasons in which he concluded that the Disputed
    Records were exempt from disclosure under both the second branch of s. 19 of <i>FIPPA </i>and the common law doctrine of
    settlement privilege.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the relevant time, section 19 of <i>FIPPA </i>read as follows:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>19.       A
    head may refuse to disclose a record that is subject to solicitor-client
    privilege or that was prepared by or for Crown counsel for use in giving legal
    advice or in contemplation of or for use in litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    19 is accepted as having two branches.  The first branch is an exemption for records that are subject to
    solicitor-client privilege.  The second
    branch is for records that were “</span>prepared by or for Crown counsel for
    use in giving legal advice or in contemplation of or for use in litigation”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Carnwath
    J. held that </span>the IPC erred in determining that the Disputed Records did
    not fall with the second branch of s. 19.  Relying on <i>Rogacki v. Belz </i>(2003),
    67 O.R. (3d) 330 (C.A.), he observed that mediation is an integral part of the
    litigation process, particularly in actions that are subject to the mandatory
    mediation rules.  Two of the mediated
    matters were subject to such rules.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 81 of the reasons, Carnwath J. stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All forms of [alternative dispute resolution],
    including both mandatory and consensual mediation, are part of the litigation
    process and are equally deserving of confidentiality and the protection of the
    Branch 2 exemption under s. 19 of <i>FIPPA</i>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carnwath J. went on to explain that interpreting the second
    branch of s. 19 in this way promotes the purpose of <i>FIPPA</i>, which is to provide “transparency of government functioning
    with exceptions where the interests of public knowledge are overbalanced by
    other concerns”: <i>Ontario (Attorney
    General) v. Ontario (Information and Privacy Commission, Inquiry Officer) </i>(2002),
    62 O.R. (3d) 167 (C.A.), at para. 14  (<i>Big Canoe 2002)</i>.  He concluded that where records are prepared
    by or for Crown counsel for use in any aspect of litigation, the public
    interest in transparency is trumped by a more compelling public interest in
    encouraging settlement of litigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in his view, the IPC’s narrow interpretation
    of the second branch would result in an unreasonable and unjust outcome:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>since it would deprive government institutions of
    the privilege attached to settlement discussions otherwise available to all
    other litigants.  Moreover, the IPC’s
    interpretation would discourage third parties from engaging in meaningful
    settlement negotiations with government institutions.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining that settlement privilege applied to the
    Disputed Records, Carnwath J. began by considering the purposes of <i>FIPPA</i> set out in s. 1(a):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>1.</b>  The purposes of this Act are,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) to provide a right of access to information
    under the control of institutions in accordance with the principles that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)  information should be available to the
    public,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) <i>necessary exemptions from the right of access should be limited and
    specific</i>, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) decisions on the
    disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently of
    government … . [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In para. 72 of the reasons, he observed that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In considering the purposes of <i>FIPPA</i>, as set out in s. 1(a), the language of the statute must be
    addressed in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the
    legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and
    special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible external aids. After
    considering all these indicators of legislative meaning, the court must adopt
    an interpretation of s. 1(a) that is appropriate. An appropriate interpretation
    is one that can be justified in terms of (a) its plausibility, that is, its
    compliance with the legislative text; (b) its efficacy, that is, its promotion
    of the legislative purpose; and (c) its acceptability, that is, the outcome is
    reasonable and just (see Professor R. Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed.
    (Markham: LexisNexis, 2008) at 1, 3-4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, Carnwath J. concluded that the public policy
    interest in encouraging settlement, as embodied in the common law concept of
    settlement privilege, trumps the public policy interest in the transparency of
    government action.  This interpretation he
    viewed as plausible and efficacious because it complies with s. 1(a), which
    provides for “necessary exemptions” that are “specific and limited”.  The exemption is necessary to maintain the confidentially
    of negotiated settlements.  It is
    specific and limited by the circumstances of this case.  Further, he opined, the interpretation is
    acceptable because it leads to a conclusion that is both reasonable and
    just.  No one would willingly entertain
    settlement discussions with a government institution if it knew its
    confidential discussions would be made public.  This is particularly so as during the settlement process the parties may
    make admissions and offer concessions that would otherwise be to their detriment.     </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises two issues.  Did the Divisional Court err in:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            1.         holding that  the Disputed Records fall within the second
    branch of s. 19 of <i>FIPPA</i>; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            2.         concluding that settlement privilege applied
    to exempt the Disputed Records from disclosure?      </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DO THE DISPUTED RECORDS FALL WITHIN THE SECOND BRANCH OF
    S. 19 OF <i>FIPPA</i>?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    will be recalled that the second branch of s. 19 provides that a record is
    exempt from disclosure if it was “prepared by or for Crown counsel for use in
    giving legal advice or in contemplation of or for use in litigation”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the present case, there is no dispute that LCBO counsel are Crown counsel.  The dispute is over whether documents
    prepared for mediation and settlement have been prepared for use in
    “litigation”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    IPC submits that the word “litigation” should be construed narrowly, to exclude
    mediation and settlement discussions.  Essentially,

    privilege.  </span></p>

    IPC also maintains that the Divisional Court’s determination that records
    shared with opposing counsel are “prepared for use in litigation” conflicts
    with two of its earlier decisions: <i>Ontario
    (Attorney General) v. Big Canoe </i>(2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 761 (Div. Ct.), at para.
    45 (<i>Big Canoe 2006</i>)<i> </i>and <i>Ontario
    (Ministry of Correctional Services) v. Goodis </i>(2008), 89 O.R. (3d) 457
    (Div. Ct.), at para. 44 (<i>Goodis 2008</i>).  The IPC submits that in both <i>Big Canoe 2006 </i>and <i>Goodis 2008</i>, the Divisional Court held that documents sent to
    opposing counsel were not “prepared for use in litigation” within the meaning
    of the second branch of s. 19 because they fell outside any reasonable “zone of
    privacy” and because they were not prepared to assist counsel in the
    litigation.    </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    I endorse the view of the Divisional Court on this issue.  In summary, the Divisional Court said
    this.  Alternative dispute resolution now
    forms an integral part of the civil litigation process in Ontario.  Various alternative dispute resolution
    methods have been incorporated into the litigation process as can be seen by
    reference to the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a> which regulate and help define the parameters of the litigation process. The Disputed
    Records were delivered as part of a mediation.  In <i>Rogacki v. Belz</i>, at paras. 44–47,
    this court observed that mandatory mediation is a part of the litigation
    process.  There is no principled reason
    to treat mandatory and consensual mediations differently, when considering
    whether they are part of the litigation process.  Furthermore, interpreting the word
    “litigation” in the second branch to encompass mediation and settlement discussions
    is consonant with public interest considerations because the public interest in
    transparency is trumped by the more compelling public interest in encouraging
    the settlement of litigation.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    in addition to the reasons of the Divisional Court on this issue, I would
    reject the narrow interpretation urged by the IPC because it runs contrary to
    basic principles of statutory interpretation.  The IPC would limit the second branch to documents that fall within the
    ambit of litigation privilege.  With
    respect, a plain reading of the second branch does not support such an
    interpretation.  When the legislature
    wished to exempt records based on privilege, it did so using clear language.  Witness the first branch of s. 19 which
    permits a head to refuse to disclose a record that is “subject to
    solicitor-client privilege”.  The words
    of the second branch follow immediately afterwards in the same provision and
    they do not use the words “litigation privilege”.  Rather, the second branch governs records “prepared
    by or for Crown counsel … for use in litigation”.  Therefore, the second branch should not be
    taken to be limited to documents that fall within the common law litigation
    privilege.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    based on recent judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada, I understand that
    fundamental common law privileges, such as settlement privilege, ought not to
    be taken as having been abrogated absent clear and explicit statutory
    language:  see <i>Privacy Commissioner of Canada v. Blood Tribe Department of Health</i>,
    [2008] 2 S.C.R. 574, at para. 11 and <i>Lavallee,
    Rackel &amp; Heintz v. Canada (Attorney-General)</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 209, at
    para. 18.  While both of these cases
    relate to solicitor-client privilege, many of the same considerations apply to
    settlement privilege.  Section 19 does
    not contain express language that would abrogate settlement privilege.  Accordingly, in my view, it ought not to be
    so interpreted.   </span></p>

    this court’s decision in <i>Big Canoe 2002 </i>may
    appear to support the IPC’s contention that the second branch is co-extensive
    with litigation privilege being extended to Crown counsel, a close examination of
    that decision reveals otherwise.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Big Canoe 2002</i>, at paras. 7-8, this
    court said that the Divisional Court was correct to find that the inquiry
    officer erred in her interpretation of s. 19 by analyzing it as consisting of
    two branches:  solicitor client privilege
    and litigation privilege.  In para. 13,
    the court goes on to explain that “it is the plain meaning of the words used in
    branch two” that is to govern.  It said
    that the inquiry officer erred by assuming that the intent behind the second
    branch was to simply extend litigation privilege to Crown counsel.  The court concluded that the exemption
    provided by the second branch was permanent.  That is, the court concluded that the exemption provided by the second
    branch was significantly different than that which would have existed had the
    records been subject only to litigation privilege.  </span></p>

    my view, <i>Big Canoe 2002</i> provides
    clear guidance of two sorts to courts called on to consider the ambit of the
    second branch.  First, give the words in
    the second branch their plain meaning.  Second,
    do not assume that the second branch is intended merely to extend litigation
    privilege to Crown counsel.  Accordingly,
    I do not view <i>Big Canoe 2002 </i>as
    standing for the proposition that the second branch is intended to cover only
    documents that fall within the ambit of litigation privilege.         </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor
    do I read <i>Goodis v. Ontario (Ministry of
    Correctional Services)</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 32 (<i>Goodis 2006</i>) as limiting the scope of the second branch to
    litigation privilege.  That contention
    rests on para. 12 of <i>Goodis 2006</i>,
    which reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    Ministry has claimed that all the documents in the private record are exempt
    from disclosure under s. 19 of the <i>Access
    Act</i>, which provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span
lang=EN-US>19.  </span></b><span lang=EN-US>A head may
    refuse to disclose a record that is subject to solicitor-client privilege or
    that was prepared by or for Crown counsel for use in giving legal advice or in
    contemplation of or for use in litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Section
    19 applies to two categories of documents<b>:</b> (1) communications between a solicitor and his or her client and (2) documents
    prepared in contemplation of or for use in litigation.  <i>Section
    19 recognizes these common law privileges: solicitor-client communication
    privilege and litigation privilege.      </i> [Emphasis added.]   <i> </i></span></p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    emphasized sentence in the quoted passage does not state that the second branch
    is limited to, or co-extensive with, litigation privilege.  Rather, it says that s. 19 recognizes
    litigation privilege.  The fact that the
    second branch recognizes litigation privilege does not mean that its scope is
    limited to documents that fall within litigation privilege.  Further, as the Court acknowledged in the following
    paragraph in <i>Goodis 2006</i>, the focus of
    its decision was solely on the first branch, that is, solicitor-client
    privilege.  Indeed, nothing more is said
    in <i>Goodis 2006 </i>about the second
    branch.  Thus, the fleeting reference in
    para. 12 to the second branch is <i>obiter</i>.     </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once
    litigation is understood to include mediation and settlement discussions, it is
    apparent that the Disputed Records – both those prepared by Crown counsel and
    those prepared by Magnotta – fall within the second branch and are exempt from
    disclosure.  Nothing more need be said to
    explain why the materials prepared by Crown counsel fall within the second
    branch.  As for the materials prepared by
    Magnotta and delivered to the Crown, in my view, they were “prepared for Crown counsel”
    because they were provided to Crown counsel for use in the mediation and
    settlement discussions.  To limit the
    second branch to records prepared by, or at the behest or on behalf of, Crown
    counsel is contrary to the plain meaning of the language of the second branch.  Furthermore, it is antithetical to the public
    policy interest in settlement of litigation because it would lead to situations
    in which the government entity’s records would be exempt from production while
    the private party’s mediation material would be producible.      </span></p>

    in <i>Big Canoe 2006 </i>and <i>Goodis 2008 </i>as inconsistent with the
    Divisional Court’s interpretation of the second branch of s. 19 in the present
    case.  In <i>Big Canoe 2006</i>, simple correspondence between counsel during the
    course of a prosecution was held to be outside the scope of the second branch.  Simple correspondence is not a document that
    was prepared “for use in the litigation”.  Rather, it was a document that was prepared <i>during the course of litigation</i>.  Nor would counsel reasonably expect that simple correspondence would
    fall within the “zone of privacy”.  Contrast that with the Disputed Records in the present case.  The Disputed Records are documents prepared
    by, or delivered to, Crown counsel to assist with mediation and settlement discussions,
    a part of the litigation process.  Furthermore, the Disputed Records were explicitly cloaked in
    confidentiality.  Before undertaking the
    mediation, the parties signed a mediation agreement that contained a
    confidentiality provision and the settlement documents were replete with
    extensive confidentiality provisions.  Clearly, the Disputed Records fall within any reasonable “zone of privacy”.  </span></p>

    held that a letter prepared by plaintiff’s counsel listing undertakings,
    advisements and refusals given on behalf of the Crown was not within the ambit
    of the second branch.  Again, in my view,
    while such a letter is prepared during the course of litigation, it was not prepared
    for “use in litigation” in the sense that counsel would reasonably expect such
    a letter to fall within the ‘zone of privacy”.</span></p>
