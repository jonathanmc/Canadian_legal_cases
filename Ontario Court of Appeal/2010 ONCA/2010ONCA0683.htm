  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants challenge their convictions on the basis
    that the verdicts against them were unreasonable or, alternatively, the trial
    judge’s reasons were inadequate.  In
    addition, the appellant, Mr. Nguyen, claims that the trial judge made an error
    in the application of the law for party liability to the circumstances of his
    case.  The appellants also appeal their
    15-year sentences.  In our view, both the
    conviction and sentence appeals must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Both appellants
    argue that their convictions were unreasonable on the basis that the underlying
    eyewitness identification evidence was unreliable.  However, in our view, it was open to the
    trial judge to accept the victim’s identification of the appellants, which was
    supported by other evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The identification of Mr. Nguyen was supported by the
    fact that Mr. Nguyen was known to the victim and was not a stranger, by the
    forensic evidence of Mr. Nguyen’s fingerprints on the water bottle at the scene
    shown on the video, and by the trial judge’s identification of Mr. Nguyen from
    the video.  Based on this evidence, Mr. Nguyen’s
    counsel conceded at trial and on appeal that Mr. Nguyen was at the gambling
    establishment at the time of the event.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence supporting the identification of Mr. Situ
    included the victim’s early statement that his “shooter” was a man referred to
    as “Phillip”.  The victim did not
    identify the shooter in any of three earlier photo line-ups.  In the fourth photo line-up, the victim
    unhesitatingly identified the appellant Mr. Situ, whose name turned out to be
    Phillip.  Although the appellant, Mr.
    Situ, argues that this identification is unreliable in part because of the
    passage of time between the shooting and the fourth photo line-up, in our view,
    the trial judge was entitled to accept the identification in light of all the
    other supporting circumstances.  We also
    observe that, at the time of the identification, the victim said that he knew
    the man in the photograph was the shooter because the shooter looked like a
    celebrity, Jet Li, as did the man the victim identified.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also do not accept the appellants’ argument
    concerning the adequacy of the trial judge’s reasons.  Twenty-two of the trial judge’s 28 pages of
    reasons are dedicated to an analysis of all the evidence regarding the core
    issue of identification.  The trial
    judge’s reasons also demonstrated that he was very much alive to the frailties
    inherent in eyewitness identification evidence and were sufficient for their
    required purposes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Nguyen raises an additional ground of appeal that
    the trial judge erred in convicting him for the offence of attempted murder on
    the basis of party liability.  The trial
    judge did so on a number of bases, including the evidence that Mr. Nguyen held
    the victim down while he was shot on the table.  In addition, the evidence disclosed that the shooter aimed but did not
    fire the final shot to the victim’s neck until after Mr. Nguyen said something
    to him.  In our view, considering all the
    circumstances, including Mr. Nguyen’s role in bringing Mr. Situ and the victim
    into contact at the billiard/gambling hall, and in addressing Mr. Situ
    immediately before the final shot was fired,  there was ample evidence to allow the trial
    judge to draw the inference that Mr. Nguyen was “the boss” during the event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also appeal their 15-year
    sentences.  In our view, subject to the
    discussion that follows about a further ground of appeal by Mr. Situ, those
    sentences were well within the appropriate range in light of the respective
    roles the two appellants played in this horrific shooting that occurred in a
    public place and rendered the victim quadriplegic.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge credited Mr. Situ on a 1:1 basis for
    his 22 months of pre-trial custody rather than applying the 2:1 credit that was
    common at the time.  In doing so, the
    trial judge described the credit as a “bonus”.  He also referred to the fact that Mr. Situ committed this crime while
    serving a conditional sentence for aggravated assault with a knife.  Even accepting the argument that these
    references constituted an error in principle, in our view, the global sentence
    imposed by the trial judge was well within the appropriate range.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Situ’s conduct in committing a violent crime while
    serving a conditional sentence for another violent crime is an aggravating
    factor that the trial judge was entitled to take into consideration in
    determining an appropriate sentence.  Such conduct demonstrates that an accused has limited potential for
    rehabilitation and may not be a candidate for early release, two foundational
    reasons for the then norm of enhanced credit for pre-trial custody.  Finally, Mr. Situ served the remaining three
    months of his conditional sentence while in pre-trial custody for this
    offence.   We would not give effect to
    this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appellants’ appeals are dismissed.</p>
