  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Eugjen Brace appeals his convictions on
    charges of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, possession of stolen
    property over $5000 and resisting arrest, and from the sentence imposed.  He raises two grounds of appeal: that the
    trial judge erred by refusing to admit a prior statement made by him tendered
    to rebut an allegation by the Crown that his testimony about the police beating
    him on his arrest was a recent fabrication, and that the trial judge erred by
    dismissing his application for a stay of proceedings due to a violation of his
    right to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find it unnecessary to deal with the first ground of
    appeal as I find merit in the second ground.  I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and enter a stay of
    proceedings because of the violation of the appellant’s s. 11(b) rights.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts relevant to the s. 11(b) issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts necessary to decide the s. 11(b) issue are
    straightforward.  The charges against the
    appellant were laid August 19, 2004 and he brought his s. 11(b) application on
    February 16, 2007, at the opening of the trial at which he was convicted.  The overall delay was about 30 months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was held in custody from the time of his
    arrest until December 22, 2004, when he was released and placed under house
    arrest subject to conditions.  The
    preliminary hearing was held on December 29, 2004 and the appellant was
    committed for trial at its conclusion.  Thus, the delay in the Ontario Court of Justice was just over four
    months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset, there was little delay in the Superior
    Court as well.  The first pre-trial was
    held on February 1, 2005.  At that
    pre-trial, the defence requested disclosure of all documents related to the
    investigation by the Professional Standards Unit of the Toronto Police Service
    as a result of a complaint that the police beat the appellant during his arrest
    on these charges.  A trial date was set
    for September 12, 2005.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 11, 2005, the defence renewed its request to
    the Crown for the internal investigation file.  On August 16, the Crown took the position that the defence had not
    requested the file at the pre-trial and that, in any event, the file consisted
    of third-party records and the defence had to bring an <i>O’Connor</i> application to obtain it.  The dispute led to a defence application for disclosure that was heard
    September 12 and 13, 2005. The disclosure application resulted in the loss of
    the first trial date. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 16, Hawkins J. ordered the Crown to
    disclose the file.  Hawkins J. took the
    view that the matter was one of simple disclosure that did not involve
    third-party records.  A second date for
    trial was set for January 9, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial began as scheduled on January 9, 2006 but
    resulted in a hung jury.  A mistrial was
    declared on January 30, 2006.  On
    February 6, 2006 a third trial date was set for November 6, 2006.  The November 6, 2006 date became unavailable
    when the Superior Court Educational Conference was rescheduled for that
    week.  The Crown learned of the conflict
    in May, 2006 and it brought an application, heard on June 8, 2006, to adjourn
    the trial to a later date.  The trial was
    adjourned to February 12, 2007.  At the
    June 8, 2006 appearance, the defence indicated it was available earlier than
    February 12, 2007 and stated its intention to bring a s. 11(b) application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 12, 2007 the Crown was unavailable and the
    matter was put over to February 16, 2007.  On February 16, 2007 the defence brought its s. 11(b) application. The
    trial judge dismissed the s. 11(b) application on February 20, 2007. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The trial
    judge’s reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the total length of the
    delay to the start of trial was some 30 months.  He noted that the Crown conceded the delay was of sufficient length to
    raise an issue as to its reasonableness.  The trial judge focused on two periods of delay, the delay caused by the
    disclosure dispute and the delay caused by the rescheduling of the new trial
    after the mistrial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In regard to the disclosure dispute, the trial judge
    found that the defence had, in fact, requested the investigation file at the
    first pre-trial on February 1, 2005.  He
    pointed out that the disclosure request included “any and all statements made
    by any witnesses to the alleged altercation between the accused and the police which
    gave rise to the charge of resist arrest.”  He agreed with Hawkins J. that the defence request was not one for the
    production of third-party records, but simply a matter of disclosure.  Nevertheless, he apportioned the delay to
    both the crown and the defence because “neither party has acquitted itself
    admirably in this respect”.  He stated
    that the defence could have followed up on its request sooner and pointed out
    that defence counsel’s firm, “could easily establish a modest tickler system at
    no great expense to facilitate this type of record building.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In regard to the scheduling of the new trial after the
    mistrial, the trial judge noted that when the conflict with the judges’
    conference became apparent, the Crown sought a further adjournment without
    indicating it was alive to the section 11 (b) issue, and did not explore
    earlier dates with the defence.  The
    transcript indicates the judge was mistaken in stating that February 12, 2007
    was the first available date for each of the defence and the Crown.  As noted above, defence counsel had indicated
    he was available earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted that the appellant led no
    evidence of actual prejudice from the delay, and he declined to infer “specific
    as opposed to implicit” prejudice.  The
    trial judge also considered that the charges were serious and that the public
    had a legitimate interest in ensuring that they were dealt with on the merits.  The trial judge concluded that the period of
    delay was not unreasonable despite the delays related to the disclosure issues
    and the rescheduling of the trial because of the mistrial.  He stated that “[h]ad the evidence in respect
    of prejudice been stronger or more case specific, I might have come to another
    conclusion.”  He dismissed the section
    11(b) application “with some reservation”.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most important issue raised in this appeal is the
    delay incurred while rescheduling after the mistrial.  Clearly, additional time to schedule the another
    trial was an inherent requirement of the case.  In <i>R. v. W.B.</i>, [2000] O.J. No.
    2186 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    at para. 61, Rosenberg J.A. said that “some short period of delay” after a
    mistrial is properly characterized as part of the inherent time requirements of
    the case.  This court was more emphatic
    in <i>R. v. Satkunananthan</i>, [2001] O.J.
    No. 1019 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  At para. 55 of the court’s decision it stated
    that,  when the trial in that case ended
    in a mistrial, “it was incumbent on the Crown to take all necessary steps to
    ensure that the third trial commenced without further delay.”  In the circumstances of that case, an additional
    delay of seven to nine months was simply not acceptable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the circumstances that caused the mistrial in <i>Satkunananthan</i> were quite different to those
    in this case, and the delay was longer as well, it would be wrong to understand
    the court’s admonition of the Crown in that case as limited to its special
    facts.  In all cases where there is a
    mistrial, the Crown should seek to schedule the retrial “without further
    delay”. In most instances, only “some short period” of further delay is
    inherently required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the mistrial was declared some thirteen
    months after the appellant was committed for trial.  The record discloses no effort by the Crown
    to seek an early date for the retrial.  It seems the Crown attached no special priority to the case, but had it
    scheduled in the normal course.  The date
    initially set for the retrial was more than 9 months after the mistrial. When
    that date became unavailable and the defence indicated that s. 11(b) was an
    issue, the Crown still did not explore when the defence was first
    available.  Instead, it asked for a date
    four months later.  More attention to an
    accused person’s s. 11(b) rights is required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, it is my view that the trial judge erred by
    allocating the delay due to the defence’s request for disclosure to both the
    defence and the Crown.  The request
    related to the police’s conduct when it arrested the appellant.  It was not a request for third-party records.  The defence made the request at the first
    pre-trial on February 1, 2005.  The
    entire delay should have been allocated to the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, while it was within the trial judge’s
    discretion to find that there was no evidence that the appellant had suffered
    actual prejudice, this was not a case that should have turned on that finding.  The trial judge failed to sufficiently
    recognize that delay, in and of itself, can be expected to have a detrimental
    effect on a fair trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As things turned out, delay did become a factor at the
    appellant’s trial. Crown counsel put to the appellant that his memory of the
    events was not worthy of belief without contemporaneous notes because of the
    passage of time.  Crown counsel suggested
    that the memories of the police officers should be preferred over the
    appellant’s because their testimony was based on contemporaneous notes.  Needless to say, the trial judge could not
    have foreseen what would occur at trial.  Equally, the appellant could not have foreseen how the Crown would
    eventually use the passage of time to his detriment and so could not have led
    evidence of that prejudice at the time of the application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has recognized that long delay,
    alone, has a detrimental effect on a fair trial.  In <i>R. v.
    Askov</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1199, Cory J., for the majority, indicated, at para.
    69 (iv) that “[t]here is a general, and in <span class=verdana>the </span>case
    of very long delays an often virtually irrebuttable presumption of prejudice to
    the accused resulting from the passage of time”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where delay exceeds the guideline period, the
    significance of actual prejudice is reduced. In <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, at para. 53, Sopinka J. writing
    for the majority said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The application of a guideline will also be
    influenced by the presence or absence of prejudice. If an accused is in custody
    or, while not in custody, subject to restrictive bail terms or conditions or
    otherwise experiences substantial prejudice, the period of acceptable
    institutional delay may be shortened to reflect the court's concern. On the
    other hand, in a case in which there is no prejudice or prejudice is slight,
    the guideline may be applied to reflect this fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge placed too much weight on the prejudice
    factor in reasoning that the s. 11 (b) application should be dismissed because
    of the lack of “stronger or more case specific” evidence of prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charges in this case are serious as the trial judge
    noted.  The appellant was alleged to have
    ignored a police officer’s gesture to stop the SUV he was driving and instead
    almost ran her down.  The public has an
    interest in having the charges dealt with on their merits.  The public also has an interest in having
    serious charges dealt with in a timely manner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances I would find that the trial
    judge erred by finding that the appellant’s s. 11 (b) rights were not
    violated.  I need not address the other
    ground of appeal. I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and enter a
    stay of proceedings.  </p>
