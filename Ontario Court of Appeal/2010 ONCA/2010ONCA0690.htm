  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal originates in the reinvestigation of cases
    where Dr. Charles Smith had provided opinions and evidence as to the cause of
    death of children.  In 1992, the
    appellant gave birth to a baby boy at her home where she lived with her
    parents.  Based on Dr. Smith’s opinion
    that the baby was born alive and died of asphyxia, the appellant was charged
    with second degree murder.  She
    eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  In 2008, the Crown consented to an extension of time to allow the
    appellant to appeal her conviction.  The
    appellant seeks to have her guilty plea set aside, the appeal allowed and a new
    trial ordered.  The Crown agrees with
    that disposition.  For the following
    reasons, we accept this joint position.  Given the positions taken by the parties, it is only necessary to
    provide a brief review of the circumstances leading up to the appellant’s
    guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From 1981 to 2005, Dr. Smith worked as a paediatric
    pathologist in Toronto.  While there were
    warning signals about Dr. Smith’s competence and professionalism, they were
    largely ignored by the medical community throughout the latter part of the 1990s
    and early 2000s.  In 2005, the Chief
    Coroner ordered a review of 45 cases where Dr. Smith had provided
    opinions.  The death of the appellant’s
    child was one of those reviewed.  The
    Chief Coroner’s review eventually led to the <i>Inquiry into Paediatric Forensic Pathology</i> conducted by Justice
    Goudge of this court.  The findings by eminent
    pathologists and other experts demonstrated serious errors by Dr. Smith.  In the appellant’s case, the findings
    demonstrate that there was never any reliable pathological evidence to support
    Dr. Smith’s conclusion that the cause of the infant’s death was asphyxia.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1992, the appellant, was 21 years old and living
    with her parents.  She gave birth to her
    child in the bathroom at home.  The
    infant’s body was discovered in a toilet bowl.  The appellant maintained that she did not know she was pregnant, and
    that the baby was stillborn.  Dr. Smith
    conducted the post-mortem and prepared a “Summary of Abnormal Findings”.  He concluded that the cause of death was
    “Asphyxia (Infanticide)”.  The same day,
    the appellant was charged with second degree murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s trial counsel had difficulty obtaining
    a forensic pathologist who was willing to challenge Dr. Smith’s findings.  In the early 1990’s, Dr. Smith had an
    outstanding reputation.  He was considered
    the leading authority in Canada in the field of paediatric forensic
    pathology.  The experts that the defence
    eventually retained had less impressive credentials, and the appellant’s
    counsel strongly believed their opinions could not convincingly challenge that
    of Dr. Smith, given his preeminent position.  Trial counsel was, however, able to convince Crown counsel to accept a
    plea to manslaughter, and not to pursue a jail sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel discussed the situation with the appellant, and
    after careful consideration she agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter. In her
    affidavit, the appellant explains her reasons for pleading guilty.  She felt she was a burden on her family; she
    was horrified of going back to jail; she was afraid of the consequences of a
    murder conviction; and she believed that Dr. Smith’s opinion would be accepted
    over her story.  Despite her guilty plea,
    the appellant has always maintained that she did not know she was pregnant,
    that her baby was stillborn and that she had not seen any signs of life in the
    baby.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. John Butt, a forensic pathologist and a former
    Chief Medical Examiner in the provinces of Nova Scotia and Alberta, was one of
    the pathologists who reviewed the death of the appellant’s child as part of the
    Coroner’s Review and the <i>Goudge Inquiry</i>.
    He was highly critical of Dr. Smith’s conclusion that the cause of death was
    “Asphyxia (Infanticide)”.  In his view,
    Dr. Smith’s opinion could not be supported by the findings at autopsy.  In particular, there was no evidence of
    mechanical asphyxiation by the appellant.  In fact, there is no pathological evidence to support any one conclusion
    as to the cause of death.  Dr. Butt also
    noted that including the legal term “infanticide” in Dr. Smith’s report was
    beyond the mandate of a pathologist.  Commissioner Goudge made this observation about Dr. Smith’s opinion in
    the appellant’s case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, pathologists should
    never include a legal conclusion in a report of post-mortem examination.  Legal conclusions are outside of their
    expertise.  There is no convention to support
    the inclusion of legal conclusions in parentheses, and doing so has the
    potential of interfering with the proper functioning of the criminal justice
    system.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Second, when using those terms, Dr. Smith was
    simply speculating about who may have caused the death of the infant or
    child.  … To include pure speculation in
    the form of findings that cannot be substantiated is inappropriate…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Michael Pollanen, the Chief Forensic Pathologist of
    Ontario, also prepared a report in the appellant’s case.  While Dr. Pollanen is of the opinion that the
    child was born alive, he too noted that the exact cause of death could not be
    ascertained by post-mortem examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant applies to have the material gathered as
    part of the Coroner’s Review and the <i>Goudge
    Inquiry</i> admitted as fresh evidence. The appellant further applies to have
    her affidavit and the affidavit of her trial counsel admitted on appeal to
    explain why she entered her guilty plea.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown fairly concedes that the new expert evidence
    meets the test for fresh evidence.  The
    Crown also agrees that the affidavits of the appellant and her trial lawyer
    should be admitted.  As Ms. Woollcombe
    puts it in her factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There can be no doubt that
    the fact that Dr. Smith was believed to have more expertise in the area of paediatric
    forensic pathology, combined with his opinion that the appellant had murdered
    her baby, created a very powerful reason for the appellant to agree to plead
    guilty to the … charge of manslaughter, rather than face trial on murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant’s plea appears to meet all the
    traditional tests for a valid guilty plea, this court retains a discretion to
    be exercised in the interests of justice, to receive fresh evidence to explain
    the circumstances that led to the plea and that demonstrate a miscarriage of
    justice: <i>R. v. T.(R.)</i> (1992), 10 O.R.
    (3d) 514 (C.A.), at 519. As a necessary corollary of the power to receive fresh
    evidence in these circumstances, the court has the power to set aside the
    guilty plea in the interests of justice, even though many years have
    passed.  This is one of those cases.  The fresh evidence establishes that without
    Dr. Smith’s flawed opinion, the appellant would never have pleaded guilty to
    manslaughter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the fresh evidence is admitted, the guilty
    plea is set aside, the appeal is allowed, the conviction for manslaughter is
    set aside and a new trial ordered.  We
    wish to thank Mr. Lockyer and Ms. Woollcombe for their assistance with this
    very sad and difficult case.  We also
    wish to acknowledge the terrible suffering that the appellant and her family
    have experienced as a result of her guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case for continuing the publication ban is
    extremely compelling in the unique circumstances of this case and is required
    to protect the appellant and her family.  Accordingly, the order prohibiting publication of the appellant’s
    identity and prohibiting publication of information that might result in
    revealing her identity is continued.  In
    our view, that would include information identifying the city where the charge
    was laid.</p>
