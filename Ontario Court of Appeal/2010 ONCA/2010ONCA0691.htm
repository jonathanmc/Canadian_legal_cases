  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By The Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As in the case
    of C.M., this appeal originates in the reinvestigation of cases where Dr.
    Charles Smith had provided opinions as to the cause of death of children.  As with C.M., the opinion given by Dr. Smith
    in the appellant’s case was one of those identified for review by the Chief
    Coroner in 2005 and was also reviewed at the <i>Inquiry into Paediatric Forensic Pathology</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reviews demonstrated that there was never any
    reliable pathological evidence to support Dr. Smith’s conclusion that the cause
    of death of the appellant’s child was asphyxia. In fact, none of the
    pathologists who gave new opinions on this case were able to offer any
    definitive opinion on the cause of the child’s death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2008 this Court granted the appellant an extension
    of time to appeal her conviction for infanticide. On this appeal, the appellant
    submits that fresh evidence be admitted, the conviction quashed and a new trial
    ordered.  The Crown agrees with that
    disposition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 1998, the appellant, then 18 years old,
    gave birth to a baby girl at her home where she lived with her father and
    brother.  The infant was either
    stillborn, or more likely, was born alive and died within minutes of
    birth.  The body was discovered by police
    the next day in the appellant’s closet, wrapped in a towel and plastic bag.
    Seventeen months later, the appellant was charged with infanticide.  The appellant maintained that she did not
    know she was pregnant and had no recollection of giving birth. In July 1998,
    she pleaded guilty to infanticide. She received a two month conditional
    sentence followed by three years of probation. In October 2006, the appellant
    received a pardon under the <i>Criminal
    Records Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. M.J. Walsh performed the post-mortem examination on
    the appellant’s baby on December 1, 1996. He certified the cause of death as
    “Anoxia in normal, live-born female”. Dr. Walsh, however, then sought a
    consultation report from Dr. Charles Smith. Without examining the body, Dr.
    Smith provided his report on January 20, 1997.  He concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia, and “in the absence
    of an alternative explanation, the death of this baby girl is attributed to
    infanticide”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant retained experienced criminal defence
    counsel who was familiar with Dr. Smith’s work.  He knew that Dr. Smith was considered the premier paediatric pathologist
    in Ontario, and likely Canada, and that a legitimate expert in his profession
    would not be able to undermine his opinions. Given this context, counsel did
    not feel that devoting the appellant’s funds to retaining a forensic
    pathologist would be of value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant eventually agreed to plead guilty, but
    refused to plead to something that would indicate that she was aware of the
    pregnancy or that she wilfully caused the death of the child.  The affidavits of the appellant and her trial
    counsel explain why she pleaded guilty.  The reasons are similar to those in C.M.’s case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in the case of C.M., the death of the appellant’s
    child was reviewed by Dr. John Butt as part of the Coroner’s Review.  He concluded that there was limited
    anatomical information available to conclude the death was asphyxia.  He indicated that the observations made by
    Dr. Smith were, neither individually or collectively capable of being linked to
    one pathophysiological process.  Dr. Butt
    concluded that the autopsy did not provide reasonable and probable grounds to
    charge the appellant. His conclusions were supported by the other four external
    reviewing pathologists. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Michael Pollanen also reviewed this case.  In his opinion, the child was born alive, but
    he agrees that the cause of death is unascertained. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Geoffrey Machin, an expert retained by the Crown,
    has offered possible explanations for the death of the infant, other than an
    intentional act.  However, he too is
    unable to come to a definitive conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, none of the new expert opinions support Dr.
    Smith`s conclusion, and none of these experts were able to offer any definitive
    opinion on the cause of death.  As in the
    case of C.M., Commissioner Goudge was highly critical of the form in which Dr.
    Smith gave his opinion and his identification of the case as one of
    infanticide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant applies to have the material gathered as
    part of the coroner’s investigation and the <i>Goudge
    Inquiry</i> and the other expert opinions obtained since then admitted as fresh
    evidence.  She also applies to have her
    affidavit and the affidavit of her trial counsel admitted on appeal to explain
    why she entered her guilty plea.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown fairly concedes that new expert evidence
    meets the test for fresh evidence.  The
    Crown also agrees that the affidavits of the appellant and her trial lawyer
    should be admitted.  Crown counsel
    acknowledged that Dr. Smith’s highly respected expertise in the area of paediatric
    forensic pathology, and his opinion that the appellant committed infanticide,
    created a very powerful reason for the appellant to agree to plead guilty
    rather than face trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown accepts that there has been a miscarriage of
    justice, that the fresh evidence justifies setting aside the plea and that the
    appeal must be allowed.  We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the C.M. case, we have addressed the question of
    setting aside a guilty plea in circumstances such as this.  The appellant’s circumstances are virtually
    identical to those of C.M. and for similar reasons we agree that the fresh
    evidence should be admitted, the guilty plea set aside, the appeal allowed, the
    conviction set aside and a new trial ordered on the charge of infanticide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We wish to thank Mr. Lockyer and Ms. Wheeler for their
    assistance with this very sad and difficult case.  We also wish to acknowledge the suffering that
    the appellant and her family have endured as a result of the flawed pathology
    opinion that led to her guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case for continuing the publication ban is
    extremely compelling in the unique circumstances of this case and is required
    to protect the appellant and her family.  Accordingly, the order prohibiting publication of the appellant’s
    identity and prohibiting publication of information that might result in
    revealing her identity is continued.  In
    our view, that would include information identifying the city where the charge
    was laid.</p>
