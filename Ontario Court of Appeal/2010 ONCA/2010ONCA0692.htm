  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Nature of Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Ryan Mitchell, and his co-accused <span
class=SpellE>Ameer</span> El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span>, were charged
    with first degree murder.  The victim,
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Taverner</span>, died during the course of a robbery,
    extortion and unlawful confinement.  At
    the plea <span style='line-height:200%'>hearing
    before</span> the trial judge <span style='line-height:200%'>on October 19, 2005</span>, the appellant pled not guilty to
    first degree murder, but guilty to second degree murder. The co-accused pled
    guilty to manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant later brought a motion to have his plea
    struck, but the trial judge ultimately dismissed it.  The appellant appeals that decision and, in
    support of his submission, seeks to have fresh evidence admitted in the form of
    a statutory declaration by the co-accused that exonerates the appellant from
    the murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed the mandatory sentence of life
    imprisonment for second degree murder but increased the period of parole
    ineligibility from 10 years to 18 years. The appellant appeals the period of
    parole ineligibility and seeks to have it reduced to 12 years.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and <span class=SpellE>Ameer</span> El-<span
class=SpellE>Khashab</span> were charged with first degree murder relating to
    the death of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Taverner</span>, who was found stabbed and
    cut over 60 times and left to bleed on the floor of his apartment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the arraignment before the trial judge on October
    19, 2005, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Ameer</span> El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> pleaded not guilty to first degree murder but guilty to the lesser included
    offence of manslaughter. The appellant pleaded not guilty to first degree
    murder, but entered a guilty plea to the lesser included offence of second
    degree murder. In so doing the accused were accepting an offer by the Crown to
    accept pleas to lesser included offences provided that both co-accused pled
    guilty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span> The Crown read into the record a statement of
    facts that told of how, on the night of March 18, 2003, neighbours on the
    second floor of the victim’s apartment building heard a loud commotion coming
    from his unit.  Someone ran up to the
    victim’s apartment to find him conscious but bleeding profusely on the floor.  The victim was transported to the hospital.  En route, the victim told the police officer
    in the ambulance that he had been attacked by two assailants.  He confirmed that one of them was the
    appellant, while the other attacker was masked.  The appellant’s cell phone was found inside
    the victim’s apartment.  Mr. El-<span
class=SpellE>Khashab’s</span> left thumbprint was found in the victim’s blood.  The police were able to follow a trail of
    blood from the victim’s residence to another apartment building nearby at 52 <span
class=SpellE>Mabelle</span> Avenue.  A
    bloody knife was found at a side door of the apartment building, and swipes of
    blood were found on the stairwells all the way up to the 18<sup>th</sup> floor.
     Both accused were located and arrested
    several days later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab’s</span> counsel
    accepted the Crown’s statement of facts, but added that the reason why Mr. El-<span
class=SpellE>Khashab</span> attended the victim’s home on the day of the
    killing was to intimidate him into repaying funds to settle a drug debt.  Things got out of hand and when the victim
    tried to stab Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span>, the appellant produced
    a knife and stabbed the victim repeatedly.  Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> did
    none of the stabbing, and instead pulled the appellant off the victim.  The two then ran to 52 <span class=SpellE>Mabelle</span> Avenue, where Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab’s</span> girlfriend lived.  The police arrived at 52 <span class=SpellE>Mabelle</span> Avenue shortly after the incident and spoke to Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span>,
    who was not yet a suspect.  He did not
    flee from the apartment building. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Struthers, who was representing the appellant at
    the time, accepted the amended statement of facts on behalf of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court accepted a joint submission to sentence Mr.
    El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> to 12 years, minus credit for his
    pre-trial custody of 2 years, 7 months, for an effective sentence of 6 years,
    10 months.  Sentencing for the appellant
    was adjourned to November 15, 2005.  The
    pre-sentence report that was eventually prepared was highly unfavourable to the
    appellant and said he was a serious threat to public safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 15, 2005, the appellant appeared again
    before the trial judge and said he wished to discharge Mr. Struthers as his
    counsel.  He wanted to be represented by
    another lawyer in order to bring a motion to strike his guilty plea.  He stated that he disagreed with the Crown’s
    statement of facts and with the pre-sentence report.  The trial judge ordered Mr. Struthers to be
    removed as counsel of record and the sentencing hearing was adjourned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s new counsel brought the motion on
    January 5, 2006 and the matter was heard over two days.  The appellant waived solicitor-client
    privilege and was cross-examined by Crown counsel.  The appellant’s criminal record and his
    pre-sentence report were entered as exhibits.  Also entered as an exhibit were the appellant’s written instructions to
    his previous counsel, Mr. Struthers, authorizing him to enter a guilty plea for
    second degree <span class=GramE>murder.</span>  Mr. Struthers was present at the motion hearing to give further
    testimonial evidence; he was cross-examined by the appellant’s new counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 6, 2006, after receiving submissions from
    counsel, the trial judge dismissed the appellant’s motion to strike his guilty
    plea.  He found that the appellant’s
    written instructions – which Mr. Struthers had drafted and read to the
    appellant before the appellant signed them – were clear and blunt.  The instructions were wide-ranging and
    covered various possible scenarios and consequences of a guilty plea.  The trial judge held that the instructions
    were unequivocal, voluntary, and informed.  He noted that the Crown’s plea bargain offer was a “package deal”, i.e<i>.</i> that both co-accused had to plead
    guilty or else there would be a trial against them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the credibility of Mr. Struthers as a
    witness, the trial judge found him to be honest, credible, and reliable.  The evidence of Mr. Struthers showed that he
    and the appellant appreciated the strength of the Crown’s case for first degree
    murder and the effect the Crown’s evidence would have on a jury.  The plea to second degree murder was intended
    to remove the possibility of a conviction of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the credibility of the appellant’s
    testimony at the motion hearing, the trial judge found him to be “a stranger to
    the truth regarding his evidence as he attempts to renege on his written
    instructions.”  The trial judge did not
    believe the appellant’s claim that he had lied to Mr. Struthers about his
    involvement in the murder.  Mr. Struthers
    even said that the appellant re-enacted the killing for him before he signed
    his instructions authorizing the guilty plea.  The trial judge held that the appellant’s efforts to have his plea
    struck were nothing more than “an attempt to manipulate the system.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his oral reasons for sentencing the appellant to
    life imprisonment – with no eligibility for parole until 18 years have been
    served – the trial judge stated that the pre-sentence report, which was
    prepared by an experienced probation officer, was “one of the most damaging to
    an accused that I have ever seen.”  The
    trial judge noted that the pre-sentence report described the appellant as a
    defiant, belligerent, and hostile young man who responded poorly to
    supervision.  The report recommended that
    “society needs maximum protection from this offender and he needs all the
    rehabilitative assistance necessary for his positive adjustment.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted that the appellant had had more
    than 20 misconducts while in custody.  The judge also quoted extensively from the psychiatric report, which he
    described as “nothing short of chilling”.  The report found that the appellant suffered from an antisocial
    personality disorder and that he was at a high risk of future violent
    recidivism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted the Crown’s submission of a
    minimum parole ineligibility period of 18 years rather than the defence’s
    proposal of 12 years.  The judge stated
    that this was a case of “aggravated second degree murder … that <span
class=GramE>comes</span> much closer to first degree murder than it does to
    manslaughter.”  He found that the record
    justified protecting the public from the appellant for a long time.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Proposed Fresh Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 1, 2009, after his last application for parole
    was denied, Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> affirmed a statutory
    declaration (“the Statutory Declaration”) that essentially states that the
    appellant had nothing to do with the murder and was not at the victim’s
    apartment when the victim was stabbed to death.  Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> states that the appellant sent
    him to collect the drug debt from the victim, but did not give instructions to
    harm the victim.  Mr. El-<span
class=SpellE>Khashab</span> attended the victim’s apartment with another
    individual whom Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> declines to name, but
    he assures that it was not the appellant.  Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> explains that he chose not to
    correct the Crown’s statement of facts at his arraignment because his counsel
    and the Crown had already agreed that he could plead guilty to manslaughter
    rather than first degree murder; Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> states that he believed that had he relayed the truth to the Crown, the plea
    deal his counsel had negotiated for him would no longer be available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> was
    cross-examined on portions of his Statutory Declaration on March 22, 2010.  He refused to waive solicitor and client
    privilege and also refused to answer the question of the identity of the other
    person who came with him to the victim’s apartment. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Issues and our Resolution of them</span></h4>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Admissibility of the Fresh
    Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose for which the appellant seeks to have the
    fresh evidence admitted is to provide him with another defence, namely, that he
    was not at the scene of the crime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>We would dismiss the application to admit fresh evidence for two reasons.
     It does not comply with the general
    rules for the admission of evidence, and it does not meet the <i>Palmer</i> test.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab’s</span> unresponsiveness on the issue
    of the critical question of who was present with him at the scene of the crime
    coupled with his refusal to waive solicitor and client privilege deprived the
    Crown of an opportunity to test his credibility.  The evidence cannot be regarded as credible
    having regard to the Crown’s inability to test the evidence.  As such, it could not reasonably have been
    expected to affect the trial judge’s decision.  The evidence should therefore not be admitted. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Did the motion judge err in
    dismissing the appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that he was not manipulating the
    system in seeking to withdraw his guilty plea on the question of first degree
    murder.  The trial judge erred in saying
    this and this view coloured his approach to the question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The appellant suggests that his plea was in fact involuntary because he
    panicked when told by counsel he would likely be found guilty.  Even if the plea was voluntary and informed,
    there is still a residual discretion to strike the plea and that discretion
    should have been exercised in favour of the appellant.  In the circumstances there was a miscarriage
    of justice.  Had the motion judge given
    effect to the appellant’s request to withdraw his guilty plea, the appellant
    would have been in the situation where he faced greater jeopardy because he
    would have been tried for first degree murder.  The motion judge should have taken this unique
    circumstance into account and weighed it in assessing the appellant’s
    credibility.  Given the seriousness of
    the offence, the appearance of fairness would have been best served by allowing
    the appellant to withdraw his plea and to have a trial.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The trial judge found the appellant’s plea to be voluntary, unequivocal,
    and informed.  There was nothing
    qualified about his guilty plea.  He was
    represented by Mr. Struthers, who was experienced counsel, and whom the trial
    judge found to be honest, credible, and reliable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The appellant’s guilty plea was not a last-minute, panicked decision, but
    the result of measured negotiations between him and Mr. Struthers, which began
    early in their relationship and continued over five days leading up to the
    plea.  The testimony of Mr. Struthers at
    the motion hearing, coupled with the appellant’s written instructions
    confirming his intention to plead guilty to second degree murder, show that the
    plea was valid.  The motion judge’s
    comment that the appellant was attempting to manipulate the system does not
    taint his conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The appellant has failed to discharge the heavy burden of proving that
    his plea was somehow deficient.  The appellant’s
    appeal from conviction based on his submission that his guilty plea should be

lang=EN-US>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Appeal of Sentence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s position is that he should have
    received life imprisonment with 12 years parole ineligibility, rather than 18
    years ineligibility.  If a joint
    submission as to sentence had been made the Crown was content to seek a period
    of parole ineligibility in relation to the appellant of 14 years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The appellant submits that his period of parole ineligibility offends the
    principle of parity of sentencing.  Although
    Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> pleaded guilty to the lesser offence
    of manslaughter and was somewhat less responsible for the death of the victim,
    both he and the appellant pleaded guilty to essentially the same facts.  Yet Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> was sentenced to six years, 10 months, while the appellant was sentenced to
    life imprisonment.  The appellant submits
    that a fit sentence for the appellant must take into account the similarity of
    his situation to that of Mr. El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>We disagree.  Manslaughter does not
    carry a mandatory sentence.  Second
    degree murder does.  The offence to which
    the appellant pled guilty was much more serious than the offence to which Mr.
    El-<span class=SpellE>Khashab</span> pled guilty.  In sentencing the appellant the trial judge
    was entitled to take into account and did take into account the individual
    circumstances of each offender, including the appellant’s pre-sentence
    report.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>A trial judge has <span class=GramE>a discretion</span> to extend the
    period of parole ineligibility for second degree murder in order to reflect the
    appellant’s culpability and to express social condemnation of the offence
    committed.  The appellant has not met his
    burden of showing that the trial judge erred in principle in the manner in
    which he exercised his discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:

    sentence is dismissed. </span></p>
