  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”),
    the hospital supervising the treatment of the respondent <span class=SpellE>L’Ambros</span> Vlachos for persecutory delusions, appeals the decision of the Ontario Review
    Board (“the Board”) granting him an absolute discharge.  CAMH submits that the decision of the Board
    is unreasonable in two respects.  First, because
    the same concerns with respect to Mr. Vlachos remained from the year before,
    the Board’s decision contradicts the decision it made a year earlier and <span
class=GramE>is,</span> itself, self-contradictory.  Second, the Board recommended that Mr.
    Vlachos be monitored by a psychiatrist in the community to ensure that he would
    continue to take his medication and to detect signs of mental illness in the
    event he ceased taking it.  Although no
    arrangements had been made in this regard, the Board granted Mr. Vlachos an
    absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 12, 2003, <span class=SpellE>L’Ambros</span> Vlachos was found not criminally responsible (NCR) of first degree murder by
    reason of mental disorder.  Mr. Vlachos
    had been suffering from delusions that various individuals, including his
    friend Joe <span class=SpellE>Pesa</span>, were conspiring to harm him and his
    family.  One morning, he drove to the gym
    where Mr. <span class=SpellE>Pesa</span> was employed, followed Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Pesa</span> down a flight of stairs, and shot him in the back of
    the head with a loaded handgun.  To this
    day, it remains unclear how Mr. Vlachos came into possession of the handgun.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mental disorder Mr. Vlachos suffered from was a
    persecutory delusionary disorder.  From
    2003 to June 2009, he remained under the jurisdiction of the Ontario Review Board
    and, with the assistance of medication, made remarkable progress.  By June 2009, Mr. Vlachos was subject to a
    conditional discharge and was living with his family in the community. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 2009, the Board convened to conduct Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> annual review and to make a disposition pursuant
    to s. 672.81(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The question for the Board was whether Mr.
    Vlachos still posed a significant threat to the safety of the public or whether
    he should instead be discharged absolutely.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class=SpellE><i>Winko</i></span><i> v. British
    Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at para.
    47, the Supreme Court of Canada held that “if the court or Review Board fails
    to positively conclude, on the evidence, that the NCR offender poses a
    significant threat to the safety of the public, it must grant an absolute
    discharge.”</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Significant threat” is interpreted as a real risk of
    physical or psychological harm from conduct that is criminal in nature.  The question of whether an NCR offender poses
    a significant threat to the safety of the public is not dependent on the
    continued existence of a mental disorder at the time: see <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Peckham</span></i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 766
    (C.A.), at p. 776; <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Wodajio</span></i> (2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 133 (Alta. C.A.), at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 39-46.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board was unable to make a decision as to whether
    or not Mr. Vlachos posed a significant threat due to both the conflicting
    expert opinions before it and an absence of certainty about Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> past.  Dr. <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Derek </span><span class=SpellE>Pallandi</span>,
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> treating psychiatrist, was of the
    opinion that Mr. Vlachos did not pose a significant threat.  After doing a file review and independent
    reading, Dr. <span class=verdana>Phil </span><span class=SpellE>Klassen</span>,
    the Deputy Clinical Director of the Law and Mental Health Program at CAMH, in
    effect opined that the threshold of significant threat had been met: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Klassen</span> stated that
    he feels that in treating the accused his caregivers have perhaps missed those
    underlying social values and attitudes that might make the accused vulnerable
    to delusions and to criminal peer pressure.  Since the accused became paranoid and delusional within the context of a
    criminal lifestyle and attitudes then the hospital argues that that is surely
    relevant to whether he’ll place himself in that position again. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board expressed concern and uncertainty about the
    degree to which Mr. Vlachos had been involved in criminal activity before committing
    the index offence, whether Mr. Vlachos would be inclined to return to that
    lifestyle if he were to be absolutely discharged, and whether that might render
    him a risk to public safety.  It should
    be noted that the Board raised similar concerns in its reasons for disposition at
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’ss</span> previous annual review, and that these
    unresolved issues formed the chief reason why the Board denied Mr. Vlachos an
    absolute discharge in 2008.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his self-reporting over the years, Mr. Vlachos has
    given inconsistent evidence about his association with the Hells Angels motorcycle
    gang and his involvement in the illegal sale of handguns and perhaps narcotics.  Mr. Vlachos told one doctor that he had sold
    “maybe a dozen” guns, told another doctor that he sold “perhaps up to 250
    handguns”, and, in the 2009 reporting year, told Dr. <span class=SpellE>Pallandi</span> that he had never sold or possessed a firearm but knew someone who did.  Upon further questioning by Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Pallandi</span>, Mr. Vlachos stated that he did not know the name
    of the individual from whom he got the handgun to commit the index offence,
    even though he had made previous statements that he got it from a family member
    or purchased it himself.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Dr. <span class=SpellE>Pallandi</span> had
    been asked to inquire further into Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> inconsistent accounts about his previous involvement in criminal activities, at
    the June 2009 hearing the Board found that “Dr. <span class=SpellE>Pallandi’s</span> questioning of the accused ... lacked any probing qualities and ... failed to
    shed any light on whether he still has any propensity to involve himself with
    criminal elements as he did prior to the index offence.”  The extent of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> past criminal lifestyle therefore remained vague.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board concluded that, given the seriousness of the
    index offence of first degree murder, and given Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> “inclination towards criminal behaviour, an exploration into the <span
class=SpellE>accused’s</span> values and attitudes” relating to his involvement
    in crime was “required”.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the Board could not make a decision on
    disposition without additional evidence on the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> history of illegal activity, it adjourned its hearing and ordered an
    independent assessment of Mr. Vlachos to determine what led to his involvement
    with crime and what effect this might have on his risk to the public. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to an Assessment Order issued by the Board on
    July 16, 2009, Dr. Brian Butler did a direct psychiatric examination of Mr.
    Vlachos and reviewed a number of documents provided by the Board.  Dr. Butler expressed concerns about Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> past anti-social behaviour and what could
    potentially happen if Mr. Vlachos did not comply with his treatment plan.  He described Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> illness as a “lethal disorder”.  He
    believed that there was a real and serious risk of Mr. Vlachos committing
    violence if he relapsed into his delusions and, in that respect, Mr. Vlachos
    was a significant threat.  Dr. Butler was
    of the opinion that Mr. Vlachos should continue treatment with a forensic
    psychiatrist who would be able to detect any subtle signs of <span
class=SpellE>decompensation</span>.  Due
    to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> background history and mental illness,
    Dr. Butler advised that caution was warranted and Mr. Vlachos should remain under
    the authority of CAMH by being subject to a conditional discharge.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the Board reconvened in December 2009, a majority
    of the Board considered Dr. Butler’s opinion but nonetheless concluded that Mr.
    Vlachos no longer represented a significant threat to the safety of the public.
     In the disposition under appeal, dated
    December 22, 2009, the Board ordered that Mr. Vlachos be discharged
    absolutely.  In reasons dated February 4,
    2010, the majority of the Board conceded that, without medication and
    treatment, Mr. Vlachos would probably relapse into his delusions and “would
    more than likely commit a serious criminal offence”.  However, it held that the likelihood of Mr.
    Vlachos suffering a relapse was not great.  It noted that Mr. Vlachos had been symptom-free for at least four years
    and had invited intramuscular injections to establish the certainty of
    medication compliance.  The Board
    observed that Dr. Butler’s evidence did not answer the question of whether Mr.
    Vlachos had in fact been involved with criminal activities and to what degree;
    yet it decided to grant Mr. Vlachos an absolute discharge anyway.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAMH’s appeal, launched February 22, 2010, had the
    effect of placing Mr. Vlachos back on a conditional discharge.  He thus continues to be monitored by the
    hospital pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of this appeal, CAMH sought to tender as
    fresh evidence an affidavit by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Padraig</span> Darby, who
    is now the Acting Clinical Director of the Law and Mental Health Program at
    CAMH.  Attached to the affidavit are the
    hospital’s clinical records for Mr. Vlachos.  The records indicate that on January 11, 2010, after his absolute
    discharge, Mr. Vlachos attended an outpatient clinic at CAMH and asked that he
    be given a prescription that enabled him to take his medication orally and to
    allow discontinuation of reporting for intramuscular injections.  His request was granted.  In my opinion, the records meet the test for
    admissibility of fresh evidence and I would admit them.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With this background, I now turn to my analysis of the
    Board’s decision dated December 22, 2009 with reasons dated February 4, 2010.The
    majority of the Board stated that Dr. Butler’s inquiry had not addressed their
    concerns, expressed at the June 2009 hearing, of whether or not Mr. Vlachos was
    in fact involved with criminal activities in the past and to what degree.  However, it then decided that the potential
    risk posed by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> past criminal behaviour
    was sufficiently minor, having regard to the current state of his mental health
    and other positive reinforcement in his life and family situation.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s majority decision did not say why the unresolved
    concerns they had—expressed both at the June 2009 hearing and in the previous
    reasons for disposition in 2008—were no longer relevant to the assessment of
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> risk to the public, such that the Board
    could now make a disposition without having those concerns addressed by Dr.
    Butler.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board noted, “Dr. Butler was unable to extract from
    the accused a fulsome explanation as to why he gave differing histories over time”.  Mr. Vlachos suggested that his differing
    accounts might have been delusional, and Dr. Butler agreed that after Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> medication was increased in 2005, his statements
    regarding past criminal activity were more in line with what he now described.  Yet during cross-examination by the <span
class=SpellE>accused’s</span> counsel, Dr. Butler stated that he was concerned
    about the vague answers that Mr. Vlachos gave concerning his involvement in the
    sale of guns.  Dr. Butler stated that he
    “would have expected a better answer and more transparency on this by now”.  Dr. Butler was also less confident that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> earlier history of significant drug abuse was
    explained by his delusionary disorder.  He concluded that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> involvement on
    the fringes of criminality was relevant to a consideration of his future risk
    to public safety, having regard to the index offence being a murder.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> account of his past criminal involvement with the Hells Angels was the product
    of his delusional disorder, the fact remains that Mr. Vlachos was able to
    acquire a real gun to commit the index offence.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> suggestion,
    apparently accepted, that his contradictory explanations about a past
    involvement in the illegal sale of guns were the product of the delusion from
    which he suffered, do not explain his present refusal to give context as to how
    he came to obtain the gun.  The Board thought
    that a thorough explanation of that issue was relevant to an assessment of his
    risk when it made its disposition in March 2008 and when it adjourned its
    hearing in June 2009.  The Board does not
    explain why it was no longer of the opinion that a thorough explanation of that
    issue was relevant to an assessment of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> risk.  The logical process by which the
    majority’s conclusions were drawn contains a gap.  This constitutes a reasoning error. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the Board’s reasons for disposition in
    March 2008 and to the concerns it expressed in June 2009, as well as Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> continuing lack of candour, the decision of the
    majority of the Board to order an absolute discharge on the basis that Mr.
    Vlachos no longer represented a significant threat to the public was
    unreasonable.  In the end result, the
    Board’s conclusion that Mr. Vlachos no longer represented a significant risk to
    the safety of the public is not supported by a reasoning process that could
    stand up to a probing examination as required b<i>y Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. <span
class=SpellE>Southam</span> Inc.</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority’s decision to grant Mr. Vlachos an absolute
    discharge was also unreasonable in that it ignored the inadequacies in Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> proposed treatment plan for monitoring medication
    compliance. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reviewing Dr. Butler’s assessment, the Board noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Butler concluded that the risk of the accused
    acting out violently if he relapsed is a real one and a serious one and in that
    respect he is a significant threat.  He
    further states that the risk of relapse is also sufficiently high to be
    significant if the accused were discharged from the Review Board system and his
    medical treatment is changed from a forensic psychiatrist to a non-forensic
    care provider. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the Board was of the opinion that while
    it might be advantageous for Mr. Vlachos to continue treatment with a forensic
    psychiatrist, it was not satisfied “that there is evidence that treatment by a
    qualified psychiatrist, albeit a non-forensic one, would likely lead to a break
    down in the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> treatment to the point where he
    would become a real and substantial risk”. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Board’s
    comment that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> compliance with medication
    could be appropriately monitored in the community by a non-forensic
    psychiatrist ignored the fact Mr. Vlachos was not proposing to be monitored by
    any psychiatrist.  Mr. Vlachos proposed
    that his family doctor, who was also a family member, monitor his
    condition.  In the event he <span
class=SpellE>decompensated</span>, he would not have <i>any</i> psychiatric expert monitoring him in the community who would
    notice subtle changes in his mental health.  If Mr. Vlachos were to stop taking his
    medication or if his medication were no longer effective, he would relapse,
    although the initial signs of such relapse might be subtle.  There was no evidence that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> family doctor was qualified to detect signs of
    Mr. Vlachos <span class=SpellE>decompensating</span>.  In this respect the Board’s decision was also
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the minority opinion, which held that in
    assessing the level of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> risk to the
    community, one has to look at more than just how well Mr. Vlachos has
    done.  The illness he suffers from is
    chronic and incurable.  He has no
    psychiatrist to monitor his condition and to detect changes.  The lack of insight into Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> pro-criminal attitude and values, which enabled
    him to access a dangerous weapon, <span class=GramE>are</span> not
    resolved.  He should therefore not have
    been discharged absolutely. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Board’s order of an absolute discharge
    was premised on the belief that Mr. Vlachos would take his medication by
    intramuscular injections, which would provide certainty that he was complying
    with his treatment regime.  That is no
    longer the case as Mr. Vlachos has switched to oral medication, which requires
    no reporting.  Basically, Mr. Vlachos is
    saying, trust me to keep taking the medication I need.    </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Vlachos has no track record of taking his
    medication orally via pills as opposed to by injection.  Before discharging him, the majority ought to
    have inquired what Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> plans were
    respecting the methodology by which he would ensure he took his medication and
    factored that into its assessment of risk to the community.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    disposition of the Board, re-instate the disposition order from February 6,
    2008, and order that his annual review be on the anniversary date in December.</p>
  <p>“K.M. Weiler

  <p>“I agree Robert P. Armstrong J.A.”</p>
  <p><a name=Text11><b>MacPherson
    J.A. (Dissenting):</b></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have read the draft reasons prepared by my colleague
    Weiler J.A. With respect, I do not agree with her analysis or her proposed
    disposition of this appeal.  In my view,
    the decision of the majority (four of five members) of the Ontario Review Board
    (ORB) was reasonable.  Accordingly, I
    would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with three preliminary jurisprudential points
    that provide the framework within which this appeal must be considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the Ontario Review Board is a specialized
    tribunal with expert membership. Referring to the ORB in <i>R. v. Owen</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    29 and 30, <span class=SpellE>Binnie</span> J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To make these difficult assessments of mental
    disorders and attendant safety risks, the Board is provided with expert
    membership and broad inquisitorial powers. While the chairperson is to be a
    federally appointed judge, or someone qualified for such an appointment, at
    least one of the minimum of five members must be a qualified psychiatrist.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is evident
    that the assessment of whether the respondent’s mental condition renders him a
    significant threat to the safety of the public calls for significant expertise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the panel conducting the
    respondent’s annual review consisted of two lawyers (including the
    chairperson), two psychiatrists and a retired nurse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the standard of review for the decisions of the
    ORB is reasonableness: see <i>Owen</i> at
    para. 31. Based on the language used in a series of Supreme Court of Canada
    decisions in recent years, it is clear that the reasonableness standard is, as
    it should be, a significant shield for most decisions made by specialist
    tribunals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, in <i>Canada
    (Director of Investigation and Research) v. <span class=SpellE>Southam</span> Inc.</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, at para. 56, Iacobucci J. described the
    reasonableness standard of review in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main,
    is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing
    examination. Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness
    standard must look to see whether any reasons support it. The defect, if there
    is one, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical
    process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a similar vein, Iacobucci J. again discussed the
    reasonableness standard of review in <i>Law
    Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247 at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no
    line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the
    tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. If
    any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in
    the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination then the
    decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in <i>Owen</i>,
    at para. 33, <span class=SpellE>Binnie</span> J. defined the reasonableness
    standard in the context of ORB decisions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he Court of Appeal should ask itself whether the
    Board’s risk assessment and disposition order was unreasonable in the sense of
    not being supported by reasons that can bear even a somewhat probing
    examination... If the Board’s decision is such that it could reasonably be the
    subject of disagreement among Board members properly informed of the facts and
    instructed on the applicable law, the court should in general decline to
    intervene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third preliminary jurisprudential point is this:
    both the wording of s. 672.54 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and the case law establish that if the NCR accused ceases to be a
    significant threat to the safety of society, the ORB <i>must</i> grant an absolute discharge: see <span class=SpellE><i>Winko</i></span><i> v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2
    S.C.R. 625, at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against the backdrop of this jurisprudential framework,
    I turn to a consideration of my colleague’s reasons. Essentially, she finds the
    ORB’s majority analysis and disposition unreasonable on two bases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, my colleague concludes that there is a crucial
    gap in the majority’s reasoning:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whether or not Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> account of his past criminal involvement with the Hells Angels was the product
    of his delusional disorder, the fact remains that Mr. Vlachos was able to acquire
    a real gun to commit the index offence. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span>  suggestion, apparently accepted, that his
    contradictory explanations about a past involvement in the illegal sale of guns
    were the product of the delusion from which he suffered, do not explain his
    present refusal to give context as to how he came to obtain the gun. The Board
    thought that a thorough explanation of that issue was relevant to an assessment
    of his risk when it made its disposition in March 2008 and when it adjourned
    its hearing in June 2009. The Board does not explain why it was no longer of
    the opinion that a thorough explanation of that issue was relevant to an
    assessment of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> risk. The logical process
    by which the majority’s conclusions were drawn contains a gap. This constitutes
    a reasoning error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not agree with this analysis. The
    ORB was unable to reach a decision at its hearing in June 2009. Accordingly, it
    ordered “an independent assessment of the accused to focus on the <span
class=SpellE>accused’s</span> involvement with organized crime and attempt to
    arrive at an understanding of what led to the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> involvement and whether these values and attitudes remain and what effect if
    any this has on the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> risk to the public and
    maintaining stability in his mental illness.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Brian Butler provided the independent assessment.
    He wrote a full report and was examined at length by counsel and the members of
    the ORB panel when the hearing resumed in December 2009. In its reasons, the
    majority considered Dr. Butler’s evidence in great detail. Near the end, the
    majority stated: “Significant weight is given to Dr. Butler’s analysis, but in
    the end his evidence has not advanced the answer to the question of whether or
    not the accused was in fact involved with criminal activities and to what
    degree.” It is this conclusion that my colleague regards as creating the
    crucial gap in the majority’s reasoning process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the alleged gap dissolves in the very next
    passage of the majority’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The majority of the Panel accept Dr. Butler’s
    opinion that the accused was likely involved in a fringe way with the
    associations that he has described variously over the years. Dr. Butler agrees
    that that antisocial activity is relevant to considering the <span
class=SpellE>accused’s</span> risk to the public. In that respect the majority
    of the Review Board Panel agrees, but this must be considered in the context of
    the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> overall situation after a number of
    years in treatment and his present circumstances. It is the majority’s
    conclusion that the potential risk posed by the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> past criminal or antisocial behaviour, although a risk to be considered, is
    sufficiently minor when one considers the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> current state of mental health and other positive reinforcement in his life and
    family situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the majority’s reasoning process is as
    follows: (1) Dr. Butler has not been able to establish the nature and degree of
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> criminal activity (if any) when he was
    a young man; (2) however, we accept Dr. Butler’s opinion that Mr. Vlachos was
    “likely involved in a fringe way” with people engaged in criminal activities
    whom he described in various interviews with treating psychiatrists; (3) these
    previous criminal associations constitute anti-social activity that is relevant
    to the ORB’s assessment of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> risk to the
    public; and (4) however, an assessment of the overall situation after a number
    of years of successful treatment supports the conclusion that the risk is
    “sufficiently minor” to permit an absolute discharge. In my view, it is
    possible to disagree with the result that flows from this reasoning, as Dr.
    Sheppard does in his minority reasons. However, it is, with respect, incorrect
    to say that there is an impermissible ‘gap’ in the majority’s reasoning
    process. Their reasoning is sound; it does not rest on a ‘logical process
    defect’ as contemplated by <span class=SpellE><i>Southam</i></span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague’s second reason for concluding that the
    majority’s decision was unreasonable is that the majority ignored “the
    inadequacies in Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> proposed treatment plan
    for monitoring medication compliance.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not accept that the majority of the
    ORB ignored this issue. The majority specifically mentioned that Mr. Vlachos
    “has committed to follow-up care with either Dr. <span class=SpellE>Pallandi</span> if he can or with another psychiatrist in the community”. The majority
    obviously regarded this as a desirable goal. However, in the end the majority’s
    view after reviewing all of the evidence, was that there were many strong
    factors – Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> symptom-free condition for
    four years, the unanimous opinion of all doctors that he was in complete
    remission, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> complete compliance with his
    medication, his own and his wife’s clear understanding of his illness and what
    is required to control it, his perfect attendance at medical appointments, the
    absence of any evidence of a return to antisocial or criminal activity or
    associations, and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vlachos’s</span> commitment to
    follow-up care with either Dr. <span class=SpellE>Pallandi</span> or another
    psychiatrist in the community – that, taken together, justified an absolute
    discharge order. In doing so, the majority was well aware of the implications
    of such an order, including the removal of Mr. Vlachos from the supervision of
    the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I return to the standard of review jurisprudence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ryan</i>, at
    para. 55, Iacobucci J. said: “A decision will be unreasonable only if there is
    no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the
    tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.” In
    my view, a fair reading of the 27-page reasons of the ORB majority in this case
    renders virtually impossible a conclusion that those reasons are unreasonable
    within the ambit of this description of the standard of review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Owens</i>, at
    para. 33, <span class=SpellE>Binnie</span> J. observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the Board’s decision is such that it could
    reasonably be the subject of disagreement among Board members properly informed
    of the facts and instructed on the applicable law, the court should in general
    decline to intervene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is this case. Dr. Sheppard’s minority opinion is,
    in a legal sense, a perfectly reasonable decision. So is the majority’s
    opinion. Accordingly, this court should not intervene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I return to the leading case dealing with the
    NCR review process. <span class=SpellE><i>Winko</i></span> is clear: if the ORB determines that the NCR accused has ceased to be a
    significant threat to the safety of society, it must grant an absolute
    discharge. That too is this case. Accordingly, the ORB did precisely what <span
class=SpellE><i>Winko</i></span> requires.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
