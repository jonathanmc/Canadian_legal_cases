    2003, the appellant, then residing in England, began a relationship with one of
    the complainants, T.D., over the internet. In July of 2004, T.D. and her
    husband separated and she moved with their two children. Shortly after the
    separation, the appellant made arrangements to visit T.D. He arrived on July 26,
    2004 and stayed with her until mid-September. He returned in mid-October,
    remaining for another two weeks. After this visit, T.D. ended the relationship
    and began a new relationship with N.W., who also lived in England. She told the
    appellant of her new relationship. The appellant made arrangements to return to
    Canada in December of 2004. He asked T.D. to pick him up at the airport on his

    day of his arrival and asked where she was and what she was doing. She believed
    that he was calling from England. The appellant rented a car at the Pearson
    International Airport in Toronto and drove to T.D.’s house. He “broke in” using
    the keys he had made on a previous visit. Using his cell phone, he then called
    her, told her that he was in England and would be arriving in Canada on

    head with the hammer. N.W. managed to wrestle the hammer away from the
    appellant, who ran into the kitchen, found a knife and attempted to cut N.W.’s
    throat, managing instead to cut his nose and cheek. N.W. struggled with the
    appellant and was cut again. N.W. and T.D. eventually managed to escape and ran
    towards a neighbour’s house. The appellant returned to his rented car and drove
    after the couple until he saw people exiting a neighbour’s house, at which

    trial, he made an application for an assessment of both fitness to stand trial
    and criminal responsibility. The trial judge granted the defence application
    and the matter was adjourned to allow the assessment to be completed. In a
    report dated December 19, 2006, Dr. Robert L. Dickey concluded that the
    appellant was fit to stand trial and <span class=GramE>that he would not
    qualify as not criminally responsible due to mental disorder</span>.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following the guilty plea, Crown counsel

    assessment under s. 752.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> to assist in determining whether the appellant was a dangerous or long-term
    offender. Crown counsel stated that as Dr. Dickey had already received some of
    the relevant material as part of the earlier fitness to stand trial and NCR
    assessment, his continued involvement might expedite the s. 752.1 assessment.</p>

    dangerous offender under s. 753 of the <i>Criminal

    Herold began by noting that the appellant had refused to cooperate in several
    of the efforts made to assess him psychologically and compile a pre-sentence
    report. He then outlined the appellant’s British criminal record and reviewed
    the facts of the offences with respect to which he was being sentenced. The
    sentencing judge noted that the appellant would be deported should he ever be
    released from a Canadian correctional facility, but rejected the argument that this
    rendered the protection of the public an irrelevant consideration, finding
    instead that this simply expanded the “public” whose protection must be
    considered.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning
    then to the evidence before him, the sentencing judge first reviewed the
    appellant’s extensive British criminal history, identifying several incidents
    in which he had abused, threatened and broken into the homes of current and
    former romantic partners and others whom he felt had wronged him. The
    sentencing judge then outlined the findings of Dr. Dickey, the psychiatrist
    assigned to assess the appellant. Dr. Dickey noted that the appellant expressed
    considerable hostility towards the complainant and rejected her version of the
    facts. Dr. Dickey concluded that the appellant is a psychopath, scoring
    34.1-36.7 out of 40 on the “<span class=SpellE>Psychopathy</span> Check List –
    Revised”, where an average male would score a four or five and an average male <span
class=SpellE>inmat</span></span>e a<span lang=EN-US> 23. In addition, the Violence Risk Assessment Guide, also administered
    by Dr. Dickey, indicated a 64% chance that the appellant would reoffend. Because
    of the appellant’s refusal to cooperate, these tests were administered using
    evidence collected when the appellant was assessed for fitness to stand trial,
    though Dr. Dickey testified that this would not have affected their accuracy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
    Dickey also identified the appellant as highly likely to reoffend independently
    of these tests, based on his own expertise and experience. He testified that
    there is no cure for the appellant’s disorder and that he did not believe it
    could be altered by psychological treatment. He noted that the index offences
    were some of the most violent he had assessed in his career. Dr. Dickey
    expressed doubt that the appellant could be managed in the community, noting
    his inability to accurately report his own <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> and the likelihood that he would fight with and manipulate the probation or
    parole officer assigned to him. Based on this evidence, and the fact that the
    appellant would be deported to England upon his release from custody and could
    therefore not be supervised in the community, the sentencing judge concluded
    that a long-term offender designation was not appropriate.</span></p>

    then to the dangerous offender designation, the sentencing judge first stated
    his conclusion that the offences committed by the appellant would qualify him
    for dangerous offender status. He found that, given his history of violence,
    there is a substantial likelihood that the appellant would cause death and
    serious bodily harm to others if given the opportunity, and that he is
    indifferent with respect to these consequences and unlikely to be inhibited by
    normal standards of <span class=SpellE>behavioural</span> restraint. Based on these
    conclusions, the sentencing judge determined that a dangerous offender
    designation was “the only one that properly suits him” and sentenced the
    appellant to an indeterminate sentence, along with a DNA order and a lifetime
    weapons prohibition.</span></p>

    his s. 752.1 report and in his testimony at the sentence hearing, Dr. Dickey
    referred to information he had received from the appellant at the earlier
    fitness and NCR assessment stage. The appellant submits that this violates s.
    672.21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which
    provides in part:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>672.21(1) <span class=GramE>In</span> this section, “protected statement” means a

    the assessment order or the disposition, or to anyone acting under that
    person’s direction.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(2)
    No protected statement or reference to a protected statement made by an accused

    are protected from use by s. 672.21, except in very limited circumstances set

    of these statements to assess the appropriateness of a dangerous offender
    designation was improper. In support of this submission, the appellant relies
    on the dissenting opinion of Lamer C.J.C. in <i>R. v. Jones</i>, [1994] 2. S.C.R. 229.</span></p>

    on a court-ordered remand, by two psychiatrists and a psychologist to determine
    whether he was fit to stand trial. He was not told that the results of the
    examinations might be used to determine whether he was a dangerous offender.
    The Crown later brought a dangerous offender application and sought to rely on
    the evidence of the psychiatrists and the psychologist. A majority of the
    Supreme Court of Canada held that the evidence was properly admitted and that
    the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> <i>Charter</i> rights had not been infringed. In reaching this conclusion, the majority made
    two points that are directly relevant to this appeal.</span></p>

    distinctions between an accused and an offender and between culpability
    proceedings and sentencing proceedings. He said at pp. 279-80:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>With
    the greatest of respect, I cannot agree with the characterization of Lamer C.J.
    that the results of the psychiatric observation are used to “incriminate” the
    accused at his dangerous offender proceedings. They are not. By the time the
    accused reaches the dangerous offender proceeding state, he has already been
    found culpable of the offence for which he was charged. He has, in effect,
    already been “criminated”, transformed from “accused” to “offender”. Section
    753 proceedings are sentencing provisions and do not constitute a separate
    charge against the offender. A conclusion that the individual is a dangerous
    offender does not constitute a separate finding of culpability any more than
    any particular sentence generates a distinct culpability.</span></p>

    broadly, the terms “accused” and “offender” are distinct terms throughout the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Section 672.1(1) defines
    “accused” for the purposes of Part XX.1 Mental Disorder of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as “includes a defendant
    in summary conviction proceedings and an accused in respect of <span
class=GramE>whom</span> a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of
    mental disorder has been rendered”. On the other hand, s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> defines “offender” as
    “means a person who has been determined by a court to be guilty of an offence,
    whether on acceptance of a plea of guilty or on a finding of guilty”. Indeed,
    the <i>Code</i> consistently refers to a
    person after a conviction as an “offender”: see, for example, ss. 718, 718.1,
    718.2, 672.67-672.71 and 696.1 of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    second crucial point made by <span class=SpellE>Gonthier</span> J. in <i>Jones</i> relates to the importance of including
    all relevant information at the sentencing stage of the criminal process and
    the connection between that goal and the opposing interpretations of s. 672.21
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. <span
class=SpellE>Gonthier</span> J. stated, at pp. 289-90 and 292:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As
    with all sentencing, both the public interest in safety and the general
    sentencing interest of developing the most appropriate penalty for the
    particular offender dictate the greatest possible range of information on which
    to make an accurate evaluation of the danger posed by the offender.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    the case of dangerous offender proceedings, it is all the more important that
    the court be given access to the widest possible range of information in order
    to determine whether there is a serious risk to public safety.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>To
    deny the court access to the earlier findings of the psychiatrists may hinder
    the effective determination of the true risk posed by the offender. While it is
    true that under s. 756 the court may remand the offender for observation for
    the purposes of gathering evidence on his dangerous offender status, the
    offender may attempt to hide elements of his character or, indeed, refuse to
    answer the psychiatrists’ questions. As a result, there is a real danger that
    evidence from the pre-trial psychiatric evaluation which is excluded may not
    surface in the post-trial phase. This creates the considerable risk that a
    dangerous offender will not be so <span class=SpellE>labelled</span> in spite
    of the fact that there was clear psychiatric evidence at the pre-trial stage
    that the offender was a serious danger to society. While such <span
class=GramE>an exclusion</span> may be acceptable while the guilt of the
    accused is in question, it cannot be justified after his guilt has been
    established. To exclude clear psychiatric evidence of the dangerousness of the
    accused would be to ask other young girls in society to bear the risk that this
    information might not emerge in the post-trial psychiatric evaluation. The
    release of Scott Jones while he continues to pose a clear threat to their
    security is not a risk that they should be forced to bear.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    is interesting to observe that in the present appeal one of the dangers
    foreshadowed by <span class=SpellE>Gonthier</span> J. in this passage has
    actually arisen. After initiating a psychiatric assessment for fitness and NCR
    purposes, after participating fully in that process with Dr. Dickey, after
    agreeing that another psychiatric assessment at the sentencing stage was
    appropriate, and after agreeing, through counsel in open court, that Dr. Dickey
    should “continue the matter since he has familiarity with the case”, the
    appellant then refused to talk to Dr. Dickey. If this on-the-ground reality of
    the appellant’s late-blooming non-cooperation is coupled with the appellant’s
    legal position that any statements he made (including test results) during his
    fitness and NCR assessments are inadmissible at the dangerous offender hearing,
    the result is very troubling – a substantial dearth of relevant and valuable
    psychiatric evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    these reasons, I would hold that the language and logic of <i>Jones</i> apply to the interpretation of s. 672.21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. I observe that the
    appellant merely notes that some of the relevant provisions have changed since <i>Jones</i> and therefore it is open to this
    court to adopt Lamer C.J.C.’s dissent in <i>Jones</i>.
    However, the appellant has not advanced any argument that the legislative
    changes post-<i>Jones</i> <span class=GramE>are</span> material changes. For myself, I cannot see that they are. Accordingly, <i>Jones</i> governs this appeal. In the end, I
    agree with what <span class=SpellE>Gonthier</span> J. said at p. 297:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>To <i>exclude</i> psychiatric evidence obtained
    in the pre-trial evaluation tending to show dangerousness would deny the court
    access to important evidence it can use to most accurately tailor the sentence
    while its admission can assist the court in reaching the most appropriate
    sentence having regard to the interests of both the offender and of society. <span

lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
    is a second, and different, reason I would decline to accept the appellant’s
    submission on the interpretation of s. 672.21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Section 672.21(2) guards against use of a ‘protected
    statement’ in certain circumstances “without the consent of the accused”. In
    this case, the evidence is overwhelming – from start to finish, the appellant
    agreed to various psychiatric assessments and to the admissibility of evidence
    derived from the assessments at various court hearings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
    the dangerous offender hearing, the appellant made no objection to the
    admissibility of the s. 752.1 assessment (Dr. Dickey’s assessment for the
    sentencing proceedings), nor to the <i>viva
    voce</i> evidence of Dr. Dickey. In the s. 752.1 assessment report, Dr. Dickey
    clearly indicated that he was relying on the prior fitness and NCR assessment,
    including interviews with the appellant. Yet the appellant did not object to the
    filing of the s. 752.1 assessment, the inclusion of the earlier fitness and NCR
    assessment, or the testimony of Dr. Dickey. Indeed, the appellant consented to
    the admission of the records of the <span class=SpellE>Penetanguishene</span> Mental Health Centre from the fitness and NCR assessment. Defence counsel
    stated that admissibility was “agreeable”; the question was the weight to be
    given to the records. These records contained the ‘protected statements’ the
    appellant now argues are inadmissible. Defence counsel also relied on some of
    these statements in arguing in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of a long-term
    offender designation. As well, the defence position at the sentencing hearing
    was that Dr. Dickey’s opinion should be afforded less weight because the s.
    752.1 assessment was incomplete without the appellant’s participation. The
    defence did not argue that Dr. Dickey’s opinion was inadmissible. Taking these
    circumstances together, I would hold that the appellant consented to the
    admission of his statements from the fitness and NCR assessment into the
    dangerous offender hearing.</span></p>

    sentence with the consent of the Canadian and British authorities and that the
    United Kingdom does have long-term and dangerous offender legislation. The

    do not accept this submission. The sentencing judge did observe that if he
    designated the appellant a long-term offender, the appellant would be deported
    to the United Kingdom once his sentence was served, which would remove him from
    further supervision in Canada and the United Kingdom. However, this observation
    was far removed from the core of the trial judge’s reasoning. The sentencing
    judge went into considerable detail stressing the threat posed by the appellant
    and the inability of any authority to control that threat. Given these
    conclusions, it is illusory to suggest that the appellant could have been found
    to meet the third criterion for long-term offender status set out in s.
