  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this matter Ms. C. appeared in person, Ms. Smart on
    behalf of the Children’s Lawyer who represented the interests of the children,
    Ms. Olsen, Ms. C.’s former solicitor and Nadia Laeeque from Crown Law Office
    Civil.  No one appeared on behalf of
    Durham Children’s Aid Society (DCAS).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. C. seeks an extension of time to appeal the
    judgment of Hughes J. dated April 12, 2010.  The applicant’s materials are incomplete and difficult to follow.  Neither the judgment nor the reasons of
    Hughes J. were filed by the applicant.  Fortunately,
    one of the other parties present had a copy of the reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. C. and her former solicitor Ms. Bobbi Olsen have
    had a falling out and Ms. Olsen no longer represents Ms. C. Ms. C. is now
    self-represented. Ms. Olsen says she ought not to have been served with the
    within application.  She is not a party
    to the proceeding and since her retainer with Ms. C. has been terminated, she
    has no interest in these proceedings. Similarly, the materials were served on
    Crown Law Office – Civil who have no involvement in these proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proceedings which are the subject of Ms. C.’s
    request began with a motion by the DCAS for summary judgment pursuant to Rule
    16 of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg.
    114/99. The motion sought a final order without trial on a protection
    application dated May 30, 2008 in relation to the applicant’s two children, S.
    C. (DOB 20 November 1994) and P. C. (DOB 2 July 1997). The DCAS sought a
    finding that the children are in need of protection under s. 37(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>g) of the <i>Child and
    Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (<i>CFSA</i>).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The father, J. C., had applied for custody under s. 57.1
    of the <i>CFSA </i>and the DCAS supported
    the father’s plan with access by the mother (the applicant in this court), V. C.,
    at the discretion of J. C., as arranged between themselves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the judgment of Hughes J., which is the subject of
    the proposed appeal, she found the children were in need of protection pursuant
    to s. 37(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>g) of the <i>CFSA </i>on May 29, 2008, the date they were apprehended and that they
    continued to be in need of protection from their mother.  The final order as requested by the Society
    was granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the judgment of Hughes J. and within the time for
    appeal, the applicant retained Ms. Olsen to consider an appeal of the judgment.
    Issues arose between the applicant and Ms. Olsen, which are not relevant to
    this application, such that Ms. Olsen’s retainer was terminated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By Notice of Motion filed July 20, 2010, the applicant
    sought leave to bring a motion to extend time for service of her Notice of
    Appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of Hughes J. dated April 12,
    2010.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This matter appears to have a long history and although
    the materials filed before me are anything but complete, everyone agrees there
    was an earlier order in 2008 whereby Hughes J. required that the applicant seek
    permission of the court before she could institute a motion. Although not a
    formal vexatious litigant order, it was an order in a similar vein.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion for an extension of time to appeal the order
    of Hughes J. came before Mullins J. on August 11, 2010. From her reasons it
    appears she granted permission to Ms. C. to bring her motion to extend the time
    for appeal but then dismissed the motion on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court Ms. C. seeks similar relief.  She seeks to appeal the order of Hughes J. of
    April 12, 2010, and because she is out of time she must seek an extension of
    time within which to file her Notice of Appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Children’s Lawyer submits that this court is
    without jurisdiction to hear the within appeal. The DCAS motion was brought
    under s. 37(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>g) of the <i>CFSA </i>and any appeal from such an order lies to the Divisional Court
    pursuant to s.&nbsp;21.9.1 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That section provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>21.9.1 Certain
    Appeals – A statutory provision referred to in the Schedule to section 21.8 or
    in section 21.12 that provides for appeals from decisions of the Ontario Court
    of Justice to the Superior Court of Justice shall be deemed to provide for
    appeals from decisions of the Family Court<i> </i>to the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Schedule to s. 21.8 includes proceedings under the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>, Parts
    III, VI and VII and s. 37(2)(g) falls under Part III of that Act and s. 69 of
    that Act provides that appeals lie to the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the submissions of the Children’s Lawyer.  In my view, this court has no jurisdiction to
    hear the within appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion is dismissed.</p>
