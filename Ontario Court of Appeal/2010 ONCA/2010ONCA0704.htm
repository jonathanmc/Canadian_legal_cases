style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was charged with two robberies on
    two separate days: December 7 and December 10, 2008.  The victim in each robbery was a driver
    delivering fast food.  The appellant was
    found not guilty of the December 7 robbery and guilty of the one that took
    place on December 10, 2008.  He was
    sentenced to 12 months in custody.  He appeals
    his conviction only.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only issue at trial was identification.  The evidence available to the trial judge on
    this issue consisted primarily of video surveillance and clothing seized when
    the appellant was arrested as well as cell phone activity.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In terms of the video surveillance tape of the
    front of the apartment building where the robbery took place, the trial judge,
    in her detailed reasons, compared her own observations of the appellant in the
    courtroom with the person in the video who she found had committed the
    robbery.  Citing <i>R. v. Nikolovski</i>, the trial judge concluded that it was open to her
    to use this analysis to assist in her determination of whether the accused
    before her was the person in the video.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge reviewed all aspects of the
    observations she was able to make about the person in the video.  She specifically considered height, weight,
    skin colour and clothing.  She attached
    varying degrees of weight to each.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While counsel for the appellant quite rightly
    submits that the video was of poor quality, the trial judge found that it did
    provide her with some assistance in her task of determining whether the Crown
    had proved identity beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon reviewing the video ourselves, we cannot
    agree with the submissions of counsel for the appellant that the video was,
    given its poor quality, little if any value.  We conclude that the basis for the trial judges reliance on the
    videotape evidence to the extent that she did was sound.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore, the videotape evidence did not, as
    the Crown points out, bear the burden of the prosecutions case.  This takes us to the cell phone evidence upon
    which the trial judge appears to have placed considerable weight.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge carefully tracked the evidence
    of the records themselves, focusing on the telephone number that was
    established as having been used to set up the robbery and the evidence
    potentially linking that number to the accused.  The trial judge concluded that this evidence was available to assist her
    in determining if identity had been made out.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on the cumulative effect of the available
    evidence, the trial judge concluded that she was satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the accused was the person who committed the December 10
    robbery.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It follows that the appellant has failed to
    satisfy us that the trial judge made any legal or factual errors in her
    analysis.  We therefore see no basis for
    interfering with her finding of guilt in relation to the December 10 robbery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
