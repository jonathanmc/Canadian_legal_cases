  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ARMSTRONG J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the parties raise a number of issues, this
    appeal raises two main questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)       Are
    the directors of a corporation, which has been placed into receivership,
    entitled to retain counsel on behalf of the corporation without prior approval
    of the receiver or the court?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)      If
    so, is counsel so retained entitled to be paid out of the assets of the
    corporation for reasonable services rendered by such counsel?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A third issue relates to the quantum of costs to which
    the boards of the appellant corporations may be entitled in respect of services
    provided by their counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellants objected to counsel for the
    receiver appearing on the appeal.  Since
    this appeal involves, to some extent, a dispute between the receiver and the boards
    of the appellant corporations in regard to their proper roles in the
    receivership, we considered it appropriate to receive written and oral
    submissions from counsel for the receiver.  The objection to the participation of the receiver in this appeal is accordingly
    dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant corporations were established by the
    federal government to operate affordable rental housing units for approximately
    300 persons from the Aboriginal community in the Peterborough area.  The corporations received their funding
    pursuant to operating agreements, first entered into in 1989, with the Canada
    Mortgage and Housing Corporation (“CMHC”).  In 1999, the federal government transferred the responsibility for
    administering and funding the corporations to the province through the Ministry
    of Municipal Affairs.  Finally, in 2006,
    the administration and funding responsibility was transferred by the province
    to the City of Peterborough (“the City”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each of the corporations is governed by a board of
    directors.  Otonabee Native Homes Inc. has
    four directors.  Kawartha Native Housing
    Society Incorporated has the same four directors plus a fifth director on its
    board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of concerns of the Ministry of Municipal
    Affairs relating to the administration and governance of both corporations, the
    Ministry commenced an action against the corporations for a declaration that
    the corporations were in breach of their operating agreements and sought an
    order for the appointment of a receiver and manager over the assets and
    undertakings of the corporations.  The
    boards of the corporations retained counsel to defend the action and to oppose the
    application for a receiver and manager.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 10, 2006, Mintz &amp; Partners Limited was appointed
    receiver and manager for six months.  On
    September 29, 2006, the receivership was extended for 18 months to March 18,
    2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 14, 2008, the Ministry moved for a further
    extension of the receivership, approval of the receiver’s accounts and reports,
    and related relief (“the March 14, 2008 motion”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 10, 2008, the motion judge delivered his
    reasons on the March 14, 2008 motion.  He
    granted, <i>inter alia</i>, a further one
    year extension of the receivership and approved the receiver’s accounts up to
    December 17, 2007 as well as certain accounts of the receiver’s counsel.  Also, on consent of the parties, the City of
    Peterborough was added as a plaintiff in the action.  The motion judge also ordered the receiver to
    pay from the funds of the <span class=GramE>corporations</span> costs of
    $32,130.64 for counsel retained by the boards of each corporation for the
    period from May 22, 2006 to March 13, 2008 – roughly the period since the
    appointment of the receiver.  The motion
    judge also ordered the receiver to make disclosure of its reports and accounts
    to the boards of the corporations.  In respect
    of the costs awarded in favour of the boards, the motion judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[19]     In
    considering the position taken by legal counsel for Kawartha and Otonabee on
    the initial motion for the interim appointment of the Receiver, although on the
    facts it might be questionable whether the Board of Directors’ opposition to
    the appointment was realistic, nevertheless, the specific grounds for the
    appointment were of some significance because of the unusual circumstances
    involved in the financial difficulties, among other things, of the
    Corporations.  Under the peculiar
    circumstances of this case, I cannot say that it was frivolous and vexatious
    for the Board to retain counsel to defend the action and to appear on the
    initial motion for the appointment of a receiver and on the “extension
    motions”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20]     I also find that counsel’s appearance on the
    motions before me to extend the time and deal with other issues has been of
    some assistance.  Under the
    circumstances, therefore, and in considering the amount of the counsel fee
    submitted, I am prepared to authorize the Receiver to pay counsel fees for
    Kawartha and Otonabee as submitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City then brought an application for leave to
    appeal the costs order and the disclosure order to a single judge of the
    Divisional Court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court judge did not decide the motion
    for leave to appeal.  In a rather unusual
    procedural move, he recommended that the parties return to the motion judge and
    request him to re-open the costs and disclosure issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties accepted the recommendation of the
    Divisional Court judge and returned to the motion judge.  The City requested the motion judge to set
    aside the costs and disclosure orders in favour of the boards.  The motion judge agreed to set aside only the
    costs order but ordered that the costs order be re-argued on a more complete
    record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the re-argued motion, the boards increased their
    claim for costs.  The boards sought
    reimbursement not only for their legal expenses related to the receivership
    litigation but also for the legal expenses related to general corporate advice
    provided between April and November 2008.  They also sought approval for the payment of future legal costs for
    general corporate advice.  The total of
    the costs sought at that time was $75,397.94, which included the $32,130.64
    previously ordered. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE MOTION JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based upon the motion judge’s analysis of the operating
    agreements, originally entered into between the corporations and CMHC, he concluded
    that the boards did not have the right to retain counsel after the receivership
    order was made.  In particular, the
    motion judge relied upon the following provisions of paragraph 16(3)(a) of the
    Operating Agreements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The receiver shall be entitled to take control,
    direction and possession or any of them of the Project, its revenues, and the
    assets, operations and books, records and accounts of the sponsor [the
    corporation], or any part of them, and the control and direction of the
    employees and agents of the Sponsor, all as may be authorized by the
    Contributor [the City], but in no event shall the receiver or the Contributor
    be accountable for any money or other property except that actually received by
    it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     The
    receiver shall at all times and in all respects be the agent or attorney of the
    Sponsor and the Sponsor shall be solely responsible for all the decisions,
    actions, inactions and defaults of the receiver, and for payment of its fees
    and disbursements.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)     The
    Contributor may at any time and from time to time change, terminate or renew
    the mandate of the receiver or replace or reinstate the receiver, but the
    Sponsor shall have no power to appoint, replace, reinstate or remove or change,
    terminate or renew the mandate of the receiver.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)      The
    powers and objects of the receiver shall be such as the Contributor may in good
    faith stipulate, and regardless of said stipulation shall, except as limited by
    the Contributor, include, to be exercised in the discretion of the receiver,
    preservation and protection and use of the Project, revenues, assets, books,
    records and accounts, and compliance by the Sponsor with all aspects of this
    Agreement, and correction and avoid-ance of breaches of this Agreement, and
    receipt and recovery of all revenues, assets and claims, and pursuit or defence
    of all actions or claims, and payment of liabilities, and rental maintenance,
    operation and repair of the Project and incurring liabilities in that regard,
    and conduct of the affairs of the Sponsor, and enactment of bylaws and
    resolutions of the Sponsor in place of and without interference by any
    officers, directors or members of the Sponsor, and preservation of and compliance
    with the rights of the Contributor, and to carry out its decisions, borrowing
    of money with or without security, and concurrence in any or all of the
    foregoing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s reading of the above provisions led
    him to make the following findings:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[46]     I
    find that the provisions of the Operating Agreements take precedence over any
    “residual rights” that a Board might retain when the Corporations were placed
    into Receivership.  When the Contributor
    exercises its remedy for the appoint-ment of a Receiver, the Receiver takes
    control and direction over the housing projects and also becomes the agent of
    the Sponsor.  The Receiver is also
    empowered to “conduct the affairs of the Sponsor in place of and without interference
    by any officer, directors or members of the Sponsor” and carry out the
    decisions of the Sponsor.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[47]     In
    addition, the Appointment Order putting the Corporations into receivership gave
    very broad powers to the Receiver, who basically took over the operation of the
    Corporations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[49]     I
    find that the Boards, on behalf of the Corporations, did not have the legal
    right to retain counsel after the Receivership appointment without leave of the
    court.  In the particular circumstances
    of this case and how it developed, however, I am prepared to consider the
    equities and the issue of fairness in considering whether I should authorize
    the Receiver to compensate from the Corporations’ funds any amount for the
    effort expended by counsel who was “retained” by the Boards.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[50]     With
    respect to legal expenses pertaining to this litigation subsequent to the
    Receivership Order, it is noteworthy that up until this point neither the
    Ministry, (being the former Plaintiff) nor the City of Peterborough, now the
    Plaintiff, took issue with whether the Boards were legally authorized to retain
    legal counsel to appear in opposition to the matters before the court.  As a result, counsel “retained” by the Boards
    has expended a considerable amount of time and effort in striving to represent
    “the interests of the Boards”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the motion judge concluded that the boards of
    the corporations had no legal right to retain counsel after the appointment of
    the receiver without leave of the court, he nevertheless was prepared to make a
    costs order in their favour.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge observed that given the history of the
    matter, it would have been advisable for the boards to have at least sought the
    opinion of the receiver on its position concerning the retaining of counsel and
    related funding.  If the response was
    negative, then counsel could have moved for directions pursuant to the terms of
    the receivership order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge then turned his mind to whether the
    boards should be awarded any costs for their representation by counsel on the
    March 14, 2008 motion.  In denying the
    boards’ costs, he again made reference to the terms of the operating agreements
    and also to certain criticism of the conduct of the boards contained in
    operational reviews ordered by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and in the
    first report of the receiver.  The motion
    judge then concluded at paragraphs 69 and 70 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[69]     In my
    assessment, the Boards seem to have handed over to legal counsel many of the
    duties, responsibilities and decisions normally made by the Boards.  As well, the Boards have expended, through
    legal counsel, considerable time and resources in litigating all conceivable
    issues.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[70]     I
    find, therefore, that the approach taken by the Boards in having legal counsel
    engaged to the extent it has was not in the genuine interests of these
    Corporations.  The Boards seem to have
    ignored the critical fact that the Corporations are bound by the provisions of
    the Operating Agreements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also declined to award any costs to
    the boards of the corporations in respect of the aborted application for leave
    to appeal to the Divisional Court.  The
    motion judge observed that on the suggestion of the Divisional Court judge, all
    parties agreed to abandon the leave to appeal hearing and return before the
    motion judge on a re-opening of the March 14, 2008 motion.  He also observed that the costs of the
    aborted application had not been raised in the Divisional Court and that he was
    accordingly disinclined to make any costs order in respect of an application that
    was not before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the motion judge addressed the non-litigation
    costs for corporate work between April 2008 and November 2008, which was
    characterized as “primarily advice” for strategic planning and corporate
    restructuring in the amount of $9,412.60.  The boards also sought prior approval for similar services in the
    future.  The motion judge declined to
    make any order in respect of these costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In spite of his legal conclusion concerning no
    entitlement to retain counsel, the motion judge made a costs order in favour of
    the boards of the corporations in the amount of $15,000 for legal services
    rendered in the receivership litigation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[84]     On an
    equitable basis, given the unusual way in which this matter proceeded, fairness
    requires me to authorize some payment of legal expenses for the efforts
    expended.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[85]     I fix
    this amount at $15,000.00 for legal services for this litigation.  As noted below, any further involvement by
    legal counsel on behalf of the Boards during the Receivership will have to be
    authorized either by the Receiver or by the court.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[86]     On
    the evidentiary record before me, I am not prepared to either allow or deny
    expenses for services for strategic planning and/or corporation/governance
    restructuring.  I suggest that any future
    retaining of legal counsel by the Boards while the Corporations are in
    Receivership should be either pre-approved by the Receiver or an application
    would have to be made for directions pursuant to the provisions of the
    Appointment Order prior to any legal expenses being incurred that may not be
    paid out of the Corporations’ funds.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[87]     In
    summary then, on the issue of the Boards’/ Corporations’ legal expenses, the
    Receiver is authorized to pay out of the Corporations’ funds the sum of

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before addressing the issues in this appeal, I must
    first address the failure of the appellants to formally seek leave to appeal
    the costs orders made by the motion judge.  Counsel for the City submits that the failure to seek leave to appeal in
    the notice of appeal ends the matter.  I
    disagree.  Here we have a case that has
    been fully prepared on all sides in terms of written material and oral
    argument.  It cannot be said that any
    prejudice could possibly be suffered by the respondent if leave were to be
    granted at this stage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Brad-J
    Investments Ltd. v. Szijjarto</i> (2006), 218 O.A.C. 315 at para. 21, this
    court said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Leave to appeal a costs order will not be granted
    save in obvious cases where the party seeking <span class=GramE>leave</span> convinces the court that there are “strong grounds upon which the appellate
    court could find that the judge erred in exercising his discretion”.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>This court has also said that “[l]eave to appeal a costs order,
    standing alone, is granted only sparingly.”  See <i>Inter-Trust Mortgage
    Investment Corp. v. 1071005 Ontario Ltd.</i>, 1999 CanLII 2724 at para. 12. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there are strong grounds upon which we
    could find that the motion judge erred in exercising his discretion in respect
    of the costs awards in this case.  I
    would therefore grant leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the three issues raised in this
    appeal.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Are the directors of the
    appellant corporations entitled to retain counsel without prior approval of the
    receiver or the court?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is trite law to say that the right to retain counsel
    is essential to the efficient operation of our system of justice.  In <i>British
    Columbia (A.G.) v. Christie</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 873, the Supreme Court said at
    para. 22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t is important to note that this Court has
    repeatedly emphasized the important role that lawyers play in ensuring access
    to justice and upholding the rule of law: <i>Andrews
    v. Law Society of British Columbia</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, at p. 187; <i>MacDonald Estate v. Martin</i>, [1990] 3
    S.C.R. 1235, at p. 1265; <i>Fortin v.
    Chretien</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 500, 2001 SCC 45, at para. <span class=GramE>49; <i>Law Society of British Columbia v. Mangat</i>,
    [2001] 3 S.C.R. 113, 2001 SCC 67, at para.</span> <span class=GramE>43; <i>Lavallee, Rackel &amp; Heintz v. Canada
    (Attorney General), </i>[2002] 3 S.C.R. 209, 2002 SCC 61, at paras.</span> <span
class=GramE>64-68, <i>per</i> LeBel J. (dissenting
    in part but not on this point).</span>  This is only fitting.  Lawyers are
    a vital conduit through which citizens access the courts, and the law.  They help maintain the rule of law by working
    to ensure that unlawful private and unlawful state action in particular do not
    go unaddressed.  The role that lawyers
    play in this regard is so important that the right to counsel in some
    situations has been given constitutional status.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the motion judge concluded from his
    analysis of the operating agreements and the receivership order that the
    boards, on behalf of the corporations, did not have the legal right to retain
    counsel without leave of the court.  He
    was of the opinion that the provisions of the operating agreement take
    precedence over any residual rights that a board retains when a corporation is
    put into receivership.  According to the
    motion judge, the retaining of counsel is a matter for the receiver or the
    court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>Counsel for the City and for the
    receiver take</span> the position that the motion judge did not deprive the
    boards of the corporations of the right to retain counsel.  They submit that the order of the motion
    judge only required the boards to seek the consent of the receiver or leave of
    the court in order to do so.  In my view,
    this is a distinction without a difference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my reading of the provisions of the operating
    agreements, relied upon by the motion judge, I do not find anything that prohibits
    the boards from retaining counsel without the consent of the receiver or
    approval of the court in respect of the receivership litigation.  Similarly, I do not agree that the terms of
    the receivership order prevent the boards from retaining counsel on behalf of
    the corporations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was considerable argument before us concerning
    the extent of the residual authority of a board of directors of a corporation
    in receivership.  In a recent judgment of
    the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal, <i>Maple Leaf Foods Inc. v. Markland Seafoods Ltd.</i> (2007), 264 Nfld.
    &amp; P.E.I.R. 126, Mercer J.A. did a thorough review of the Canadian
    jurisprudence on the residual powers of boards of directors of companies placed
    in receivership.  At paragraphs 37 and
    38, Mercer J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Upon a receivership the directors retain residual
    powers.  [Though] they are displaced in
    respect of powers exercisable by the receiver-manager, they remain in office
    and can exercise limited functions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The powers of the receiver-manager are stated in
    the court order of appointment or in the private appointment as authorized by
    the security instrument … Powers which the receiver-manager is not authorized
    to exercise remain vested in the directors.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><i>Maple Leaf Foods </i>involved
    the receivership of a share capital corporation.  The motion judge concluded that cases concerning
    share capital corporations although “helpful for analogy purposes” do not
    “apply to the situations before the court.”  While these cases are certainly distinguishable both on their facts and
    the legal structure of the corporations, I find that the general principles
    articulated by the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal to be relevant to
    the circumstances here.  Morawetz J., of
    the Ontario Superior Court, adopted the above principles in <i>Inyx Canada Inc. (Re)</i>, (2007), 36 C.B.R.
    (5th) 154 at para. 5.  See also <i>Toronto Dominion Bank v. Fortin et al.</i> (1978), 26 C.B.R. 168 at pp. 171-172.  The
    receiver’s authority in this case is derived from the order of the court.  Beyond the limits of that order, residual
    authority to act for the corporations rests with the boards of directors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever their residual authority may be, the boards
    continue to have an obligation to act in the best interest of the
    corporations.  If, in their opinion, the
    appointment of a receiver is not in the best interest of the corporations or if
    they believe that the steps being taken by the receiver on behalf of the
    corporations are not in the corporations’ best interest, then they are entitled
    to retain counsel to bring the matter to the attention of the court.  It will be for the court to decide if the
    boards have acted responsibly and reasonably in doing so.  Clearly, if the boards were to advance
    defences in the action then they have a right to retain counsel in order to do
    so.  To the extent that the boards need
    to be paid out of the funds of the corporations, then they may decide to bring
    an application for an advance costs award.  However, approval of the court is not a prerequisite to retain counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said<span class=GramE>,</span> the right to retain
    counsel by the board of a corporation in receivership is not unfettered.  If, for example, a lawyer is retained for a purpose
    that has the effect of interfering with the receiver’s legitimate duties as an
    officer of the court or his or her duties as the manager of the ongoing
    operation of the corporate enterprise, then I would agree with the motion judge
    that such a retainer is not appropriate.  One can think of other examples where the retainer would not be
    appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, I can see no basis for denying the
    boards the right to retain counsel in respect of the receivership
    litigation.  Indeed, this is particularly
    so when neither the City nor the receiver took any objection to the boards’
    retaining counsel and appearing on the various motions.  It is also particularly so when the motion
    judge has made a finding, as he did on the March 14, 2008 motion, that he could
    not say that “it was frivolous and vexatious for the Board[s] to retain counsel
    to defend the action and to appear on the initial motion for the appointment of
    a receiver and on the ‘extension motions.’”  He added that he found counsel’s appearance on the motions to extend the
    time and deal with other issues of some assistance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that in addition to appearing on the motion for
    the appointment of the receiver, counsel retained by the boards of the
    corporations appeared on eight interlocutory motions (six of which were
    initiated by the City) and related cross-motions.  It is also important to bear in mind that the
    defendants in these actions are the corporations.  I have no difficulty in concluding that the
    boards had the right to retain counsel on behalf of the corporations in respect
    of the receivership litigation without seeking the consent of the receiver or
    the approval of the court.  Absent the
    ability to retain counsel, the boards would be unable to advance a defence on
    issues that are put against them by the City.  In a different fact scenario, this point was made by Anderson J. of the
    British Columbia Supreme Court in <i>Toronto
    Dominion Bank</i> at 172.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;

    corporation for reasonable services rendered by counsel?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are no blank cheques.  The court will decide whether a board is to
    be reimbursed for the legal expenses in taking a particular course of action.  On exercising its discretion to make a costs
    award in favour of a board of a corporation in receivership, the court may, in
    addition to the factors under Rule 57 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, consider
    the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether the position advanced by counsel for the board
    had any merit;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether the board was acting in the interest of the
    corporation;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether the position advanced by the board was properly

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>whether</span> the position advanced
    by the board detracted from the orderly administration of the receivership.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The above is obviously a non-exhaustive list and, as always,
    each case will turn on its own particular facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the boards’ involvement in the
    receivership litigation, the motion judge was not able to say in the March 14,
    2008 motion that the retaining of counsel was frivolous.  Indeed, he said that counsel’s appearance was
    of some assistance to him.  Although, in
    his reasons on the re-argument of the motion, he said that the retaining of
    counsel “was not in the genuine interest of the Corporations”, he did so on the
    basis of his interpretation of the provisions of the operating agreements with
    which I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the positions advanced by counsel for
    the boards were properly advanced by the boards rather than by the
    receiver.  Counsel was taking positions
    adverse to the positions advanced by counsel for the receiver, particularly in
    respect of the receiver’s appointment and in respect of the extension of the
    receivership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there were suggestions by counsel for the City
    and for the receiver that the participation of counsel for the boards may have
    been disruptive to the receivership, there was, as was pointed out by the
    motion judge, no objection taken to counsel appearing for the boards in the
    receivership litigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is worth noting that our colleague Blair J.A.,
    sitting in chambers, made an order permitting the boards of the corporations to
    retain counsel on behalf of the corporations for the purpose of this appeal and
    that reasonable legal fees and expenses of counsel are to be paid out of the
    corporations’ assets after assessment.  In coming to this conclusion, Blair J.A. said at paragraphs 5 and 6 of
    his reasons of December 3, 2009:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[5]       Here,
    the Board[s]’ ability to pursue the important issues that are raised on the
    appeal would be hollow in the extreme if they are not in a position to retain
    and properly pay legal counsel.  The
    appeal cannot be effectively prepared, presented and argued on behalf of the
    Corporations without the benefit of counsel.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[6]       Accordingly,
    I have no hesitation in directing and ordering that the appellants may be
    represented by counsel on the appeal and that the Boards are entitled on their
    behalf to retain counsel for purposes of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Counsel for the City submitted that there were alternative
    sources of funding that should have been explored by the boards of the
    corporations in order to retain counsel.  A reference was made to the National Aboriginal Housing Association and
    the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association.  There was no evidence before us as to whether funding from these
    associations fell within their organizational mandate in respect of the issues
    in this litigation.  I am not persuaded
    that there was any obligation on the part of the boards of the corporations to
    pursue funding from outside organizations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the boards of the corporation are entitled
    to their costs on a partial indemnity scale for their participation in the
    receivership litigation.  Such costs
    should be paid by the receiver out of the funds of the corporations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take a different view of the claim for costs by the
    boards in respect of general corporate advice apparently related to services
    for strategic planning and/or corporate restructuring.  Given the reality of the receivership, it
    seems to me that any legal work in respect of strategic planning should be done
    in conjunction with the receiver and with the approval of the court as long as
    the receivership is in place.  I would
    not interfere with the motion judge’s decision to deny these costs.  Also, in respect of a claim for the approval
    of future legal expenses for strategic planning and/or corporate restructuring,
    I see no reasonable basis upon which that could or should be done without
    seeking the co-operation of the receiver and/or the approval of the court.  If the boards have a specific strategic plan
    or project in mind for which they need corporate legal advice, then they should
    seek the co-operation of the receiver and/or take it to the court for its
    approval.  On such an application to the
    court, counsel would have to persuade the court that the expenditure of legal
    fees for strategic planning or corporate restructuring by the boards was in the
    best interest of the corporations.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What is the quantum of costs
    that should be ordered in favour of the corporate boards of the appellant
    corporations?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the costs award for the receivership
    litigation, I would restore the award of $32,130.64 made by the motion judge on
    the March 14, 2008 motion.  The aforesaid
    figure is the figure that the motion judge thought was appropriate prior to changing
    his mind on the re-argument of the appeal.  I am satisfied that the figure is fair and reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would also make an order granting the boards
    reimbursement for the costs of the corporations on the March 14, 2008 motion as
    originally argued.  I note that the
    corporations were largely successful on that motion.  There is no reason to deny them their costs.    Counsel for the boards filed written costs
    submissions to the motion judge in which he claimed costs on a partial
    indemnity scale in the amount of $9,435 for fees and $626.68 for disbursements.  On this appeal, he amended his request to
    $7,500.  In my view, such an amount is
    fair and reasonable and I would make an award in the amount of $7,500 inclusive
    of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the boards are also entitled to be
    reimbursed for the costs of the corporations on the re-argument of the March
    14, 2008 motion on a partial indemnity basis.  If the parties cannot agree on quantum, then they may submit written
    submissions to us double-spaced and not to exceed five pages in addition to a
    bill of costs within 15 days of the release of this order.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the above reasons, I would delete paragraphs 2 and
    6 of the order of the motion judge dated June 17, 2009.  Paragraph 2 provides that, “any further
    involvement by legal counsel on behalf of the Boards of Directors of the Corporations
    during the Receivership will have to be authorized either by the Receiver or by
    the Court.”   In my view, the boards are
    not required to seek prior authorization to retain counsel in respect of this
    litigation.  However, as indicated above,
    the retaining of counsel for other purposes such as strategic planning and
    corporate restructuring should be preceded by consultation with the receiver
    and/or the approval of the court.  Paragraph
    six provides, “that there shall be no costs for the motion heard on March 14,
    2008.”  As I have indicated, it is my
    view that the boards are entitled to be reimbursed for their costs of the March
    14, 2008 motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the above reasons, I would order that costs of
    counsel retained by the boards on behalf of the corporations be paid out of the
    funds of the corporations by the receiver as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$32,130.64 as provided in paragraph 42 herein; and</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$7,500.00 as provided in paragraph 43 herein.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>In the event that there are not sufficient funds available to
    the corporations, then I would order that the City should be responsible for
    the above costs.</p>
