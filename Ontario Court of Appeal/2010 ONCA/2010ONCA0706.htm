  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Jeanvenne appeals from his convictions for first
    degree murder in relation to two killings of Donald Poulin and Michel
    Richard.  The murder occurred more than
    17 years apart; and the murders were strikingly dissimilar in nature.  The motives were different.  The method of killing and the weapons were
    different.  The killings took place in
    different locations and settings; nothing about the killings qualified as
    similar fact evidence.  No direct
    evidence connected the appellant to either crime.  The only common connection was investigative;
    the police obtained a number of allegedly inculpatory statements from the
    appellant respecting each crime during the course of the same “Mr. Big”
    operation that was launched for that express purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sought a severance prior to trial.  Justice Kealey refused the request.  Respectfully, he erred in that regard, in my opinion,
    and I would allow the appeal on that ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in
    refusing to declare a mistrial following two prejudicial outbursts by an
    unsavoury, but charismatic, Crown witness to the effect that the appellant had
    murdered a third individual and attempted to murder a fourth (the
    witness).  Were it necessary to do so, I
    would also allow the appeal on this ground with respect to the Poulin count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My reasons for arriving at these conclusions follow.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donald Poulin was murdered on January 18, 1983, Michel
    Richard on May 17, 2000.  Both deaths
    occurred in Ottawa.  Mr. Poulin’s is described
    to be an assisted suicide or “mercy killing”, and Mr. Richard’s was an
    execution-style killing.</p>
  
  <h3>The Poulin Murder</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Poulin’s body was found late at night lying by the
    side of the Rideau Road in Ottawa.  He
    had been shot twice with a shotgun, found lying some 8-10 feet from the
    body.  Initially, the death was
    attributed to suicide, since Mr. Poulin had a history of depression and had
    previously attempted to shoot himself in the <span class=GramE>Spring</span> of
    1981.  After the autopsy, however, the
    police formed the opinion that Mr. Poulin had been murdered in an assisted
    suicide or “mercy killing” context.  The
    appellant was not at first a suspect.  No
    forensic evidence associated him with the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of certain statements made by the appellant
    during the Mr. Big operation in 2002-2003 – to which I shall return shortly –
    the police believed that the appellant was the killer, and he was charged with
    Mr. Poulin’s murder.  At trial, the Crown
    called other evidence as well.  The
    appellant’s ex-wife, Lisa Paquette, testified that the appellant admitted his
    involvement in the murder and told her that Mr. Poulin had asked him and
    another man, Jean Viau, to do a “mercy killing”, saying that he “didn’t want to
    live anymore.”  One of Mr. Poulin’s
    brothers, Gilbert Poulin, also testified that the deceased had told him he had
    found a close friend of the family “to finish what he did to himself, to take
    his life.”  The appellant was a close
    friend of the family, Gilbert Poulin said, although he would not have imagined
    Mr. Jeanvenne assisting in his brother’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were some problems with the evidence relating to
    the initial police investigation of the Poulin murder.  The police officers involved had lost their
    notes.  The pathologist who had conducted
    the autopsy had died.  Some of the photographs
    taken at the scene of the crime were missing.  The shotgun found at the scene had been lost.</p>
  <h3>The Richard Murder</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michel Richard’s murder was quite different.  His body was found in his apartment amidst
    the blood-spattered signs of a significant struggle.  The autopsy revealed 18 sharp force wounds to
    his head, neck, chest, arms and back, and a .32 calibre bullet through his left
    arm and chest which was said to have caused the death. Investigators found a
    blood-stained knife, but it bore the DNA of the deceased only.  There was no DNA or other forensic link
    between the appellant and the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, the Mr. Big Operation yielded potentially
    damaging statements from the appellant regarding the Richard murder.  In addition, the Crown called a number of
    arguably unsavoury witnesses to support its theory that the appellant had
    murdered Mr. Richard because he believed that Richard had “ratted” on him to
    the police in relation to a break-in and theft in which they had been involved several
    years before the murder.  One witness,
    Jean-Claude Massie – whose outburst formed the basis for the mistrial
    application referred to above, and to which I will return – testified at some
    length as to the appellant’s involvement in that break-in and theft and other
    illegal activities; he also said the appellant had been going around five or
    six months before the murder saying that Richard was an informer for the
    police.  Another witness, Charles
    Felteau, testified that the appellant had told him that Mr. Richard “got what he
    deserved and he deserved to be dumped (i.e., killed) ... for ratting him out
    and he (i.e., the appellant) dumped him.”  A third witness, Denis Bruyère, gave evidence
    that he had visited the appellant to get some drugs shortly before the Richard
    murder and had found the appellant trying to take the cylinder out of .32 or
    .38 calibre firearm; the appellant told him he “had a score to settle.”</p>
  <h3>The Mr. Big Operation and Statements</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between July 2002 and early 2003, the police conducted
    a “Mr. Big” operation designed to elicit incriminating statements from the
    appellant.  Such operations have been
    held to be legitimate police investigative tools when conducted properly: <i>R. v. Szanyi</i> (2010), 254 C.C.C. (3d) 528
    (Ont. C.A.).  In this case, the appellant
    was introduced to an undercover officer, Constable Lazenby, who played the role
    of a high-ranking member of a crime family and who – if the appellant were to
    become a member of the organization – could offer work in the criminal
    milieu.  The appellant was also introduced
    to another undercover officer, Constable Stephane Grondin, who pretended to be
    a “soldier” in the organization.  The
    police hoped that Grondin’s background as a native French Canadian would build
    a trusting relation with the appellant by offering him the inducement of
    membership in the criminal organization and, in the process, extract
    inculpatory confessions from him about both the Poulin and the Richard murders.  For example, as part of the ruse, Constable
    Lazenby pretended he wanted the appellant to kill someone for him, and
    repeatedly used this subterfuge to discuss the appellant’s experience in
    killing people.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ploy worked, to some extent.  While he denied, for the most part, any
    involvement in the two murders in question, the appellant eventually stated
    that he had “whacked” several people who were close to him and made certain
    other statements that connected him with the Poulin and Richard killings.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>August 14,
    2002</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 14, 2002, the appellant told Constable
    Lazenby that every time someone dies in Ottawa the cops look at him.  In response to a question about how many
    homicides he was looking at, the appellant said “five or maybe eight ... two
    for sure.”  He acknowledged that one of
    the murders the police were looking at him for was the Richard killing.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>September 16,
    2002</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 16, the appellant told Constable Lazenby
    about a robbery he had committed with a partner, “Michael.”  Michael had been caught with hash sometime
    later, the appellant said, and had <span class=GramE>ratted</span> the
    appellant out about the robbery, and shortly after that had died.  The appellant said “that’s the way things go,”
    but, Constable Lazenby acknowledged, did not accept responsibility for the
    Richard murder at that time.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>October 14,
    2002</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 14, the police taped a conversation between
    Constable Lazenby and the appellant, in which the appellant provided details of
    a “mercy killing” he had committed “15, 20 years ago.”  The appellant said that he had killed the guy
    – who was a close friend – as a “favour” because the guy “wanted to die” and
    had previously tried to shoot himself in the head with a .22-gauge rifle; he “popped
    him like he wanted me to pop him,” with a .10 gauge shotgun.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>November 22,
    2002</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 22, the appellant spoke with Constable
    Grondin about both the Poulin and Richard murders.  The conversation took place while the two
    were driving from Sudbury to Montreal and after the police had staged a police
    stop of the car during which the appellant was made to hear over the police
    radio that he was suspected of the two killings.  Constable Grondin later asked the appellant
    who Richard was.  The appellant responded
    that he and Richard had robbed a safe together and Richard had <span
class=GramE>ratted</span> him out.  He
    then said to Constable Grondin: “j’y ai faite la passe,” meaning – according to
    Constable Grondin – “I killed him.”  The
    appellant also said that when the police found the body it was “toute déchrissé”,
    or “all messed up.”  That homicide was
    about 2 ½ years before.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the same conversation, Constable Grondin asked about
    Poulin.  The appellant replied that
    Poulin was a friend who had <span class=GramE>ratted</span> him out and that he
    had to deal with three friends that ratted him out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The November 22 conversation was not recorded.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>November 29,
    2002</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a subsequent conversation with Constable Lazenby on
    November 29, however – when asked to provide details of his previous experience
    committing murders – the appellant refused to provide further information, and
    denied that he had spoken about his involvement in the murders with Constable
    Grondin.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On other occasions as well, during the M. Big
    conversations, the appellant denied any involvement in the Poulin and Richard
    murders.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Massie Statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jean-Claude Massie was, by everyone’s account, an
    unsavoury but somewhat charismatic witness.  A former criminal associate of the appellant, he was called by the Crown
    – as noted above – to buttress its theory that the appellant had killed Mr.
    Richard in retaliation for Mr. Richard having ratted on him regarding the
    earlier break-in and theft in 1992.  During
    the course of his testimony, however, Mr. Massie blurted out two unsolicited
    and highly prejudicial remarks.  On the
    first occasion, he stated that the appellant had killed Jean Viau – the man
    Lisa Pasquette said the appellant had told her was with him at the time of the
    Poulin murder.  On the second occasion,
    he suggested that the appellant had tried to kill him (Massie).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first outburst occurred during Mr. Massie’s
    examination in chief.  The following
    exchange took place: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. So Michel [Richard] <span class=GramE>plead</span> guilty and the charges were eventually withdrawn? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. They were all dropped against us. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. All right. <i>Did
    you know a man named Jean Viau?</i> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. <i>Yeah, Jean
    Viau, I know him. He killed him.</i> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. How long did you know Mr. Viau? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.
    Mr. Viau, I knew him a long time. He’s from Lowertown.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>They did a bank them, him and Viau. </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. You can’t talk about anything about that. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.
    Oh, I didn’t know, as soon as the Viau name comes out, I</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>was</span> told I could – okay. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=right style='text-align:right'>[Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was some debate about whether, when Mr. Massie
    said “he killed him”, he was referring to the appellant or to Mr. Richard.  It was unclear on the record whether the
    witness had pointed or motioned to the appellant in the prisoner’s dock when he
    made the statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second outburst occurred during cross-examination.  Defence counsel suggested that the police had
    agreed not to charge Mr. Massie in relation to the break-in and theft incident
    in exchange for his testimony against the appellant.  The witness denied this, but not without elaborating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Okay. And did they tell you that you can’t be
    charged with it because you’re going to give evidence against Mr. Jeanvenne? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. No.  Not
    for that. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. No, why did they tell you you can’t be charged
    for it? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. <i>Because
    Mr. Jeanvenne tried to have me killed here, I’m not gonna stand there like a
    nut and wait for him to come and kill me. So I told my son – I got five sons,
    and they ain’t small.</i> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. But why did the detectives tell you you can’t be
    charged with <span class=GramE>this ...</span> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.
    He said everybody cannot be charged with this. It’s with everybody, not only
    me. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=right style='text-align:right'>[Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How these outbursts evolved into the mistrial ground of
    appeal will be explored later in these reasons. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LAW AND
    ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3>The Severance Issue </h3>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>General Principles </span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court of Canada’s most recent clarification
    of the principles relating to the severance of counts in an indictment is found
    in <i>R. v. Last</i>, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 146.  A trial judge has a broad discretion to sever
    under s. 591(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> where he or she is satisfied ‘‘the interests of justice so require.”  Once the discretion is exercised, the judge’s
    decision must be afforded considerable deference; an appellate court may only
    interfere where the judge has “acted unjudicially” or “the ruling resulted in
    an injustice.”  The onus lies on the
    accused who seeks the severance to persuade the court on the balance of
    probabilities that the interests of justice so require.  See also, <i>R.
    v. Arp</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 52; and <i>R. v. Litchfield</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333, at p. 352. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Court pointed out in <i>Last</i>, at paras. 15 and 21, the two grounds for intervention involve
    different inquiries.  In determining
    whether the judge acted unjudicially, the court inquires into the circumstances
    prevailing at the time the ruling was made, and should only intervene if the
    judge erred on a question of law or principle, or made an unreasonable
    decision.  In determining whether the
    ruling resulted in an injustice, the court looks at the entirety of how the
    trial and the verdicts unfolded.  In this
    regard, as Charron I.A. said in <i>R. v.
    Rose</i> (1997), 100 O.A.C. 67, at para. 17: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is necessary to consider
    the entire trial, including the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence,
    the closing addresses of counsel, the judge’s instructions to the jury and any
    inference that may be drawn from the ultimate verdicts returned by the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At paras. 16-17 of <i>Last</i>,
    the Court canvassed the overall considerations bearing upon the judge’s
    exercise of discretion, as well as the factors to be considered:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The ultimate
    question</i> faced by a trial judge in deciding whether to grant a severance
    application <i>is whether severance is
    required in the interests of justice</i>, as per s. 591(3) of the <i>Code</i>. The interests of justice encompass
    the accused’s right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well
    as society’s interest in seeing that justice is done in a reasonably efficient
    and cost-effective manner. <i>The obvious
    risk when counts are tried together is that the evidence admissible on one
    count will influence the verdict on an unrelated count.</i> [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Courts have given shape
    to the broad criteria established in s. 591(3) and have identified factors that
    can be weighed when deciding whether to sever or not. The weighing exercise
    ensures that a reasonable balance is struck between the risk of prejudice to
    the accused and the public interest in a single trial. It is important to
    recall that the interests of justice often call for a joint trial. ...Severance
    can impair not only efficiency but the truth-seeking function of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Court identified a non-exhaustive list of

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Trial Judge’s Decision</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s motion to
    sever.  In brief reasons, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no similar fact linkage between the two
    events except of course that they have – it is suggested a common
    perpetrator.  Defence must satisfy this
    Court on a balance of probabilities that severance is required in the interest
    of justice, which test is considered under the following points: the general
    prejudice, factual and legal nexus, undue complexity of the evidence, the
    possibility of inconsistent verdicts, <span class=GramE>the</span> desire to
    avoid a multiplicity of proceedings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I indicated during the submissions, it seems to
    me that it’s less compelling that severance <span class=GramE>be</span> granted
    where the facts are not similar within the legal notion of similar fact
    evidence than when the converse exists, and this is the case before me.  There is no element of inconsistent verdicts
    present, nor does it seem to me that there will be any unduly complicated
    evidence.  The defence position seems to
    be that facing two charges of murder in <span class=GramE>itself</span> creates
    an overwhelming prejudice to an accused person, which cannot be offset by jury
    instructions.  I don’t agree with that
    proposition.  In addition to some other
    individual testimony, the thrust of the Crown’s case emerges from the
    admissions allegedly made by Mr. Jeanvenne to two police undercover agents in
    the course of his involvement with the […] purported illegal activities.  Whether Mr. Jeanvenne’s statements will be
    believed by the jury requires a consideration of the whole context within which
    they were made, together with of course all of the other evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’m satisfied that proper instructions can
    alleviate any concern for improper or impermissible reasoning on the part of
    the jury, or a misuse of the evidence on the two counts.  And as such, at this juncture, I find that
    the defence has not met the onus.  The
    severance application is dismissed.  If
    and when it is known that Mr. Jeanvenne may wish to testify on one or the other
    of the counts that he faces in this indictment, then the question of severance
    may be revisited.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span lang=FR-CA>R. v. JeanVenne</span></i><span

  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Analysis</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the trial judge erred on both grounds in
    failing to grant a severance in the circumstances of this case, but in
    particular on the ground that he acted unjudicially.  His decision was “unreasonable” on a number
    of grounds.  It also resulted in an
    injustice, in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, his decision was based in a significant way on
    his mistaken view that the absence of similar fact evidence between the two
    murders militated <i>against</i> rather than <i>in favour of</i> the case for a
    severance.  The trial judge made this
    observation both in his reasons and during the course of counsel’s arguments
    respecting severance.  In fact, however,
    the contrary is generally the case.  Mr.
    Alvaro acknowledges on behalf of the Crown that the trial judge erred in his
    assessment of how the absence of similar fact evidence impacts upon an
    application for severance, but argues that the error did not taint the entirety
    of the judge’s reasoning and was cured by the admittedly strong mid-trial and
    final instructions to the jury about the impermissibility of using bad character
    evidence for improper propensity reasoning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was facing two counts of murder – the
    most serious crime known to the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and one evoking the greatest possible jeopardy in the justice
    system.  While there is nothing in the <i>Code</i> that prohibits the joinder of more
    than one murder count in one indictment, there is very good reason, in such
    circumstances, to apply a more stringent application of the severance test in
    favour of the accused in such cases – particularly where, as here, the murders
    are completely unrelated: see <i>R. v. Khan</i> (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 108 (Man. C.A.) (<span class=GramE>aff’d</span> on
    other grounds, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823.  This
    flows from the common sense proposition that a jury may have great difficulty
    dissociating the evidence of one homicide from the other and in refraining from
    drawing the impermissible inference that because the accused may have committed
    one murder – bad character evidence of the highest degree – he or she is likely
    to have committed the other.  The potential
    for serious prejudice to the accused is at its zenith in such
    circumstances.  When there is no similar
    fact evidence connecting the two crimes, there is even less justification for
    refusing to sever.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge did consider the defence argument
    that facing two charges of murder created an overwhelming prejudice to the
    accused that could not be offset by directions to the jury, he dismissed it on
    the simple basis that he did not agree.  He failed to give effect to the need to apply a more stringent
    application of the test in double-murder count circumstances.  The error was compounded by his reverse
    application of the considerations surrounding the absence or presence of
    similar fact evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These errors in principle make the trial judge’s
    decision unreasonable in the sense called for by the severance jurisprudence,
    and are in themselves sufficient to justify appellate intervention.  It therefore falls to this Court to decide,
    according to proper principles, whether severance should have been granted: see <i>R v. Savoury </i>(2005), 200 C.C.C. (3d)
    94, at para. 26 (Ont. C.A.).  In my view,
    a severance should have been granted.  In
    addition to the foregoing considerations, there are other factors that militate
    in favour of granting severance in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, there is no factual or temporal nexus whatsoever
    between the Poulin and Richard murders, except – as the trial judge
    acknowledged – a suspected common perpetrator.  As I have noted earlier, the murders were committed 17 years apart, with
    no apparent connection between the two victims; the motives behind the murders
    differed significantly (a “mercy killing”/assisted suicide on the one hand, and
    an execution-style killing on the other hand); the weapons used and the method
    of killing were different; the locations of the killing were as well; and there
    was nothing about the two killings that could qualify as similar fact
    evidence.  The trial judge gave little
    weight to these considerations, except to the extent that he viewed them in the
    context of his mistaken similar fact analysis referred to above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is there much, if any, legal nexus between the
    murders.  The two counts do not
    constitute overlapping transactions and, while the essential elements of the
    crime of murder remain the same, the application of the facts to those elements
    is entirely dissimilar in each case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge placed considerable emphasis on the
    fact that the Crown’s case depended significantly on the admissions allegedly
    made by the appellant during the course of the Mr. Big operation.  He concluded that the jury required the whole
    context of all of those statements in order to be able to assess the
    credibility of the evidence and the reliability of the statements.  Before us, Mr. Alvaro submitted that the
    evidence emanating from the undercover sting could not be separated neatly into
    little packets without removing from the jury consideration of the context in
    which the statements were made; reliability and context, he argued, were
    strongly interwoven.  I am not persuaded
    by this argument, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge failed to consider whether the various
    statements could be edited in the context of separate trials without
    potentially harming the probative value of the evidence as a whole and with a
    view to minimizing the prejudice potentially jeopardizing the appellant’s fair
    trial.  Why was it irretrievably
    necessary that the jury considering the Poulin murder hear the appellant’s
    alleged confessions respecting the Richard murder, for example, and vice
    versa?  With one exception – the November
    22 conversation between the appellant and Constable Grondin en route from
    Sudbury to Montreal – the statements allegedly made respecting one murder were
    made during different conversations with Constables Lazenby and Grondin than the
    statements respecting the other, and at different times.  The statements on August 14 and September 16,
    2002, referred only to Mr. Richard, that of October 14 to Mr. Poulin.  While the November 22 conversation covered
    both, I am not convinced that the evidence could not have been given
    effectively in separate trials with appropriate redactions of references to the
    other murder as may have been required.  Again, the failure of the trial judge to consider these options
    constituted an error, in my view.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, considerations relating to economy of trial
    time and administrative resources arising from the Mr. Big undercover officers
    having to testify more than once if a severance were granted – the multiplicity
    of proceedings issue – bear less weight here, given the serious nature of the
    charges.  Nor is the possibility of inconsistent
    verdicts a concern.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant indicated to the trial judge that he had
    not yet decided whether he would testify at all, or with respect to one count
    rather than the other.  This can be an
    important consideration, but the trial judge took this into account when he
    stated that the appellant could renew his mistrial application after that
    decision had been made, if so advised.  The appellant never did so.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally – and more importantly – however, the case as
    put forward by the Crown with respect to both murders was replete with very bad
    character evidence.  But much of the bad
    character evidence pertaining to one murder would not have been pertinent to
    the other.  Yet the jury was exposed to
    it all.  The risk of impermissible
    propensity reasoning was overwhelming, notwithstanding the strongest jury
    instruction possible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Massie’s gratuitous remarks attributing two other
    murderous acts to the appellant are one example of this type of evidence.  There are others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For instance, the evidence of Lisa Paquette related
    only to the Poulin murder.  She testified
    as to the appellant’s admission to her that he had been involved in that
    murder, and that he had done so in the company of Jean Viau.  None of this pertained to Mr. Richard’s
    death.  Nonetheless, it was the witness
    Massie’s outburst – in the context of the Richard murder – about the appellant having
    killed Viau that gave rise to the mistrial application.  A piece of evidence relating to one unrelated
    killing potentially poisoned the evidence in the other.  In addition, Ms. Paquette gave extensive
    evidence about the appellant’s drug use and involvement in the drug trade, his
    volatile nature and the fact that she was afraid of him – none of which would
    have been heard in the context of the Richard charges had a severance been
    granted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, considerable evidence was called by the
    Crown in relation to the Richard case regarding the appellant’s involvement in
    a life of crime and, in particular, about his membership in the break and enter
    gang that had committed the crime giving rise to the theory that Mr. Richard
    had ratted the appellant out.  This
    evidence was led not only through the unsavoury Mr. Massie, but also through a
    number of other arguably unreliable witnesses, including Charlies Felteau,
    Denis Bruyère and Andre Quesnel.  Again
    none of that evidence would have been heard in the Poulin proceeding, had it
    been tried separately.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the witch’s brew of all of this
    evidence in the cauldron of a single trial was potentially prejudicial to the
    appellant in a devastating manner, for all of the reasons outlined above.  It is for this reason that I conclude the
    decision not to sever resulted in an overall injustice in this case.  The review of the evidence at the outset of
    these reasons indicates that there was, indeed, evidence upon which the jury
    could have convicted the appellant on both counts of murder.  However, the Crown’s case was not
    unassailable in either case.  Much of the
    original investigatory evidence relating to the older Poulin murder was missing
    or difficult to establish.  The balance
    of the case depended largely on the jury’s acceptance of Ms. Paquette’s
    evidence and that of the undercover officers.  So, too, did the case against the appellant in relation to the Richard
    murder depend upon the acceptance of the Mr. Big testimony, buttressed by that
    of a series of admittedly – or at least arguably – unsavoury <span class=GramE>witnesses.</span>  Credibility was central to the resolution of
    all of these issues.  Whether the
    appellant chose to testify or not – or on one count rather than another – the
    risk of cross-pollination by the jurors of the evidence from one count to the
    other and of the resort to prejudicial propensity reasoning cannot be
    understated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Balancing all of the relevant factors, and weighing the
    interests of justice as a whole, I am satisfied that the trial judge erred in
    refusing to sever the two unrelated murder counts, and that such a severance
    should have been granted.  It was
    required in the interests of justice, in the circumstances.</p>
  <h3>The Mistrial Application</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the foregoing, it is strictly speaking
    unnecessary to deal with the mistrial issue.  For the reasons that follow, however, I am satisfied that the trial
    judge erred in failing to grant a mistrial, at least with respect to the Poulin
    count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of Mr. Massie giving rise to the mistrial
    issue is outlined earlier in these reasons (at paras. 21-25).  His rash remarks were problematic, to be
    sure.  Essentially, Mr. Massie portrayed
    the appellant as a murderer or attempt murderer with respect to two other
    alleged incidents.  In the first
    instance, responding to a question whether he knew a man named Jean Viau, Mr.
    Massie said: “Yes, he killed him.”  Although there was some ambiguity in the context whether “he” was a
    reference to the appellant or to the deceased, Michel Richard, there was an
    open inference that “he” meant the appellant.  In the second incident, Mr. Massie said that the appellant had tried to
    kill him (i.e., Mr. Massie).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the break following the first statement, trial
    counsel for the appellant expressed concern about the remark and indicated he
    would be bringing a motion for a mistrial.  The trial judge decided to hear the balance of Mr. Massie’s evidence and
    to deal with the mistrial motion at the end of the day or on the following
    day.  The testimony of Mr. Massie
    continued, with no caution of any sort being given to the jury at that time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second incident occurred during Mr. Massie’s
    cross-examination.  Again, no caution was
    provided to the jury.  Four more short
    witnesses gave evidence to complete the day.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the following day, October 4, 2005, the trial judge
    heard the mistrial submissions.  At the
    end of argument he declined to rule on the mistrial motion, taking the position
    that he wanted to hear the whole of the evidence before doing so.  He felt, in particular, that if the wiretap
    evidence the Crown was proposing to tender in the context of the Mr. Big operation
    were ruled admissible –it ultimately was – that evidence would take the edge
    off the significance of the Massie utterances: “Mr. Massie’s offhand
    remark[s]”, he said, “will pale.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Court did not sit on October 5.  On October 6, the trial judge provided a
    strong mid-trial caution to the jury, saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On Monday, Mr. Massie, in his evidence, you may
    have noted, said that Mr. Jeanvenne killed a Mr. Viau and in cross-examination
    he may have suggested to you that Mr. Jeanvenne was also going to kill Mr. Massie,
    himself.  In such evidence, which was
    blurted out by Mr. Massie, is not admissible and is not to be considered by you
    for any purpose.  In addition to its – to
    what I’ve said about the impermissible reasoning process, this evidence has
    another layer, it is rank and gross hearsay evidence and is not to be used by
    you for any purpose in your deliberations at the end of the trial.  I ask that you just put those remarks totally
    out of your minds.  They should be
    completely ignored by you.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time, as requested by defence counsel, the
    trial judge gave a strong mid-trial <i>Vetrovec </i>warning to the jurors about the need to be cautious in considering the
    testimony of Mr. Massie, given his lengthy criminal record and lifestyle.  This included a direction that “[they] must
    closely scrutinize his testimony and be careful, because it is dangerous for
    [them] to act on that evidence without confirmation, unless [they were]
    satisfied completely that it [was] trustworthy.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not revisit the mistrial issue
    until after his charge to the jury.  At
    that point he declined deal with it again, taking the position that he had
    already ruled on it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both of these unsolicited statements by Mr. Massie were
    inadmissible.  No one contests this.  The statements were unresponsive to the
    questions Mr. Massie was being asked and unrelated to the charges the appellant
    was facing.  They constituted bad
    character evidence of the worst sort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that trial judges are particularly well-placed
    to assess the impact of inadmissible and potentially prejudicial evidence in
    the context of the trial dynamic, including the effectiveness of any warning
    that may be issued.  Their discretionary
    decision whether or not to grant a mistrial is entitled to great
    deference.  Indeed, trial judges
    themselves are only to order a mistrial “as a last resort, in the clearest of
    cases and where no remedy short of that relief will adequately redress the
    actual harm occasioned”: <i>R. v.
    Toutissani, </i>2007 ONCA 773, at para. 9.  See also <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [2001] 3
    S.C.R. 823, at para. 36, and <i>R. v.
    Chiasson</i> (2009), 258 O.A.C. 50 (C.A.) at para 14.  The court will only interfere where, in the
    exercise of his or her discretion, the trial judge is clearly wrong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were it necessary to do so, I would hold that this is
    one of those rare instances where the court would be justified in interfering
    with the trial judge’s refusal to grant a mistrial.  Respectfully, the trial judge erred in
    misapprehending, or failing to consider, the particularly damaging nature of
    the “Jean Viau” statement in relation to the Poulin murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it may be that there was some uncertainty on the
    record about whether Mr. Massie had pointed to the appellant when he said “he
    killed him”, it was a strong inference open to the jury that “he” meant the
    appellant.  Jean Viau was the person Ms.
    Paquette said the appellant told her had been involved with him in the Poulin
    killing.  Thus, there was an equally
    strong inference open to the jury that the appellant had killed Mr. Viau in
    order to silence him and cover up his own participation in that murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had the severance been granted, the Poulin jury would
    not have heard the evidence of Mr. Massie.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appears not to have considered this
    particularly dangerous chain of reasoning, and the complicating layer of his
    earlier refusal to grant the severance, in reaching his conclusion.  I agree that the reference of the unsavoury
    witness, Massie, to the appellant trying to have <i>him</i> killed, might pale in comparison to the statements to the
    undercover officers that he had “whacked” or killed a number of people – or be
    subsumed in the generic nature of that reference.  However, the same is not the case with the
    Jean Viau outburst.  It pointed to the
    appellant in a specific and prejudicial way in relation to the Poulin murder
    and I am not satisfied that even the strong mid-trial and final instructions
    that were given would be adequate to enable the jury to disabuse themselves of
    that information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, Mr. Smith argues that, even if no mistrial
    were declared, the jury had to be warned about the dangers of impermissible
    propensity reasoning and told to ignore such evidence “immediately” (see <i>R v. D. (L.E.)</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111, at
    p. 127) and “in the strongest terms” (see <i>R
    v. Woods</i> (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 20 (C.A.), at p. 32-33.  Here, he submits, that did not happen.  The effect of the sequence of events outlined
    above was that the jury was left for two days to absorb and think about the
    prejudicial remarks before any correcting instruction was provided to
    them.  The evidence must have affected
    the jurors’ deliberations and thinking at least during the period of time
    before they were told to ignore the evidence, if not thereafter.  It cannot be said with any assurance that the
    jurors would be able to disabuse their minds of the comments even with the
    strong mid-trial instruction that was given, he concludes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this argument in the
    circumstances here.  The evidence of the
    four witnesses who were called after Mr. Massie and before the Court adjourned
    on October 3 was short and uncomplicated.  The mid-trial instruction was given at the first opportunity thereafter
    when court resumed with the jury. There is no magic in the word “immediately,”
    in my view.  The mid-trial instructions –
    indisputably strong –were given clearly and sufficiently close in time to the
    impugned evidence, without waiting until the close of trial, to counter
    whatever limited prejudicial impact the statements may have had in the overall
    context of the trial, in my view: see <i>R.
    v. Colas</i> (2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 335 (Ont. C.A.), at paras 47-48. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent it means anything, then – and in the
    context of the refusal to grant a severance – I conclude that the trial judge
    erred, in the circumstances here, by failing to order a mistrial in relation to
    the Poulin murder charge.  I do not think
    he erred in failing to do so with respect to the Richard count.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, then, I would allow the
    appeal and order a new trial with respect to both counts of murder, to be tried
    separately.</p>
