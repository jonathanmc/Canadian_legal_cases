  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Pauline Amato, was injured in a motor
    vehicle accident on January 17, 2005. Following a trial before Justice Howden,
    and a jury, in which the jury was called upon only to assess damages, liability
    having been conceded, the jury awarded the respondent $100,000 in general
    damages, $109,000 for past loss of income, $389,000 for future loss of income
    and $400,600 for future care costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants seek to set aside the judgment entered
    in accordance with the jury’s verdict and request that a new trial on the issue
    of damages be directed. The appellants raise three issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            Did
    the trial judge improperly interfere with the conduct of the trial by
    questioning witnesses, not for the purpose of clarifying their evidence but for
    the purpose of enhancing the plaintiff’s credibility and assisting her case;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            Did
    the trial judge unfairly diminish the position of the defence in his charge to
    the jury; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Was the jury’s award so excessive that it
    should be set <span class=GramE>aside.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants did not pursue the third ground of
    appeal in oral argument. In any event, we see no basis for interfering with the
    jury’s award. If, as appears to be the case, the jury concluded that the
    respondent was telling the truth about the nature and extent of her injuries
    and the pain she was suffering, the awards are not excessive, let alone grossly
    excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the primary ground of appeal, our
    review of the record leads us to conclude that while the trial judge did
    question a number of witnesses, at considerable length in some instances, the
    questions posed were largely designed to clarify answers that had been given
    in-chief or cross-examination and/or to elicit further information that would
    enhance the jury’s understanding of the witnesses’ evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By and large, the questions posed by the trial judge took
    the form of examination-in-chief. They were non-leading in nature and largely
    non-confrontational. Questions that took the form of cross-examination were,
    for the most part, limited to follow-up questions that logically flowed from
    responses the witness had already given to non-leading questions. In our view,
    the appellants have failed to demonstrate that the trial judge’s questions
    affected the defence in any material way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding that the trial judge’s questioning did
    not overstep the bounds of propriety, we note that experienced defence counsel [not
    Mr. McCarthy or Ms. Lemke] did not raise a single objection to the questions
    which the appellants now submit, for the first time on appeal, were highly
    prejudicial and improper. In the same vein, we note that defence counsel,
    although invited to do so, did not ask any questions arising out of the
    questions posed by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this court has said before, trial counsel are in the
    best position to gauge whether a trial judge is overstepping the bounds of
    propriety and improperly interfering with the conduct of the trial. While not
    fatal, a failure to object constitutes powerful evidence that neither the
    appellants nor their counsel felt that the trial judge was improperly
    interfering with the conduct of the trial as they now suggest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. McCarthy, for the appellants, forcefully submitted
    that we should not place undue emphasis on the failure of trial counsel to
    object. He observed that it is difficult for counsel to object to the conduct
    of a trial judge and counsel often feel constrained from doing so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much as we appreciate Mr. McCarthy’s submission, there
    are times when trial counsel can be expected to raise objections, especially when
    they feel that a trial judge is exceeding the bounds of judicial propriety and
    taking up the cause of one of the parties. Polite but firm objections, in these
    circumstances, are entirely appropriate. Counsel should not feel constrained
    for fear of judicial censure. In this regard, we note that defence counsel was
    not shy to object when he felt the need to do so. The record disclosed several
    occasions in which he forcefully but politely, registered his disagreement with
    the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, we would not give effect to the
    primary ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the second ground, we are not at all
    persuaded that the trial judge failed to fairly put the position of the defence
    to the jury. In fact, the trial judge made every effort to instruct the jury in
    a fair and balanced manner and in our view, he set out the position of both
    sides fully and fairly. In particular, we are not persuaded that defence
    counsel’s objection to one sentence of the trial judge’s description of a
    defence doctor’s evidence was valid. In any event, the trial judge instructed
    the jury that it was their interpretation of the evidence that should govern. Further,
    we view the appellants’ complaint that the trial judge did not fully describe
    the “expertise” of the defence doctor as inconsequential. In the end, we see no
    basis for interfering.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, we would dismiss the appeal. Costs to
    the respondent in the agreed-upon amount of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and applicable taxes.</p>
