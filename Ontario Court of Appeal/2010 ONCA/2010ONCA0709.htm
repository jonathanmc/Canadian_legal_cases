  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in this case is the meaning of “special
    circumstances”, which, under s. 11 of the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. S.15, is the pre-condition a client must show where the
    client seeks to have solicitors’ accounts that have already been paid referred
    for assessment.  In this case, the
    appellant Echo Energy Canada Inc. and five of its directors retained the
    respondent Lenczner Slaght Royce Smith Griffin LLP in relation to certain
    litigation.  On the recommendation of
    Lenczners, the appellant retained Voorheis &amp; Co. LLP to assist with some
    aspects of the litigation.  Once some of
    the litigation was finished and another group had obtained control of the
    appellant, the appellant sought to assess the Lenczners and Voorheis accounts.  Because the accounts of the two firms,
    totalling almost $840,000, had all been paid, the appellant had to establish
    special circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time, the appellant sought to refer the
    paid accounts of McCarthy Tétrault LLP for assessment.  McCarthys had been retained by the former
    control group as the appellant’s corporate lawyers because the previous
    corporate lawyers had a conflict of interest.  It had submitted accounts of $144,000 for its work over a one year
    period. All but one of these accounts <span class=GramE>were</span> paid before
    the change of control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge, Brown J., found there were no
    special circumstances with respect to any of the accounts and refused to direct
    the references.  For the following
    reasons, I would allow the appeal in relation to Lenczners and Voorheis but
    dismiss the appeal with respect to McCarthys.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Litigation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Echo Energy Canada Inc. is a corporation
    with natural gas operations in Ontario.  In 2007, one of the directors, Salvatore Fuda, who also controlled a
    substantial number of shares, came to believe that the public disclosure of the
    appellant’s gas reserves was not accurate.  In November 2007, the appellant received a request from Challenge Gas
    Holding AB, which held over 11 million shares and was controlled by Mr. Fuda,
    to appoint an independent consulting engineer to review the appellant’s gas
    reserves and to appoint an additional director.  When Mr. Fuda did not receive a response, he requisitioned a meeting of
    the appellant’s Board of Directors.  This
    meeting was held on November 20, 2007, and Mr. Fuda’s proposals were
    rejected.  At this same meeting, the
    Board authorized a private placement of shares that would have had the effect
    of diluting the shareholding position of the Fuda group.  The following day, the Fuda group
    requisitioned a special shareholders’ meeting for the purpose of voting two of
    its nominees onto the Board.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The November 2007 events set in motion various pieces
    of litigation including:  an oppression
    action by the Fuda group, which included an application for an injunction to
    stop the private placement; an application by the appellant and five non-Fuda
    directors led by the president, Gary Conn, alleging that the Challenge shares
    had been acquired by an illegal takeover; and a counter-application by the Fuda
    group seeking contribution and indemnity from the appellant’s then corporate secretary,
    whose firm was also corporate counsel.  A
    special shareholders’ meeting was held on April 22, 2008, with the question of
    whether the votes of the Challenge shares could be counted to be determined by
    the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 28, 2008, Morawetz J. dealt with some of
    the litigation.  Most importantly, he
    held that the Challenge shares had been legally obtained and therefore its
    votes should be counted.  This resulted
    in a change of control of the Board.  New
    management led by the Fuda group replaced Mr. Conn and retained an independent
    reserves engineering firm.  The engineering
    firm found that there had been significant declines in the appellant’s gas
    reserves, causing it to take a write-down on its gas reserves from $44M to $11.8M.  Since taking control, new management has
    found evidence indicating that former management may have known about the
    decline in reserves.  The appellant has
    commenced litigation against some of its former officers and directors for
    breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Retainer of Lenczners and Voorheis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a meeting of the appellant’s Board on December 31,
    2007, the Board passed a resolution to establish a special committee to deal
    with matters arising out of the Fuda litigation.  The special committee was compromised of
    three of the five directors being sued by the Fuda group: Mr. Conn, Salvatore
    Pacifico and Robert Moore.  Mr. Fuda
    objected to the composition of the special committee.  However, he was outvoted and the resolution
    passed.  The resolution establishing the
    special committee included the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The special committee will have the responsibility
    to supervise litigation, negotiate any details related to litigation or to
    address any matters of concern that may be identified by the special committee
    related to the litigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The special committee was authorized to retain such
    external financial, legal and other advisors as it considered necessary.  Importantly, it was also required to “keep
    and maintain minutes of [its] proceedings”.  New management has been unable to locate any minutes of proceedings of
    the special committee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the December 31 meeting, the appellant had
    retained Lenczners to act for it in defending the oppression action brought by
    the Fuda group.  The retainer agreement
    was dated December 17, 2007, and authorized Lenczners to employ “such counsel,
    agents or experts as you deem necessary”.  The retainer letter was executed by Mr. Conn on behalf of the
    appellant.  Lenczners understood that it
    had also been retained to act for the five directors who had been made parties
    to the oppression action.  Lenczners
    understood that the fees of the appellant and the five directors would be paid
    by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime in December 2007, the appellant and the five
    directors accepted Lenczners’ recommendation to retain Voorheis to act as
    special counsel to provide specific specialized corporate expertise.  There is no letter of retainer relating to
    Voorheis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2008, with the change in management, the
    appellant discharged Lenczners and Voorheis.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Lenczners and Voorheis Accounts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From December 2007 to October 2008, Lenczners rendered
    13 accounts totalling $520,000.  The
    accounts are all stamped as being approved, with Mr. Conn’s signature or initials.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Voorheis rendered five accounts over the period from February
    to June 2008 totalling $317,000.  Three
    of the five accounts bear the initials of Mr. Conn as having approved
    them.  The exceptions are the accounts of
    April 3 and April 18, 2008, for almost $74,000 and over $34,000 respectively,
    which were paid on the day after receipt and the same date as receipt
    respectively.  Although they have the
    approved stamp on them, there are no initials to verify that Mr. Conn approved
    those two accounts.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>McCarthys’ Retainer and Accounts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2007, the appellant retained McCarthys to
    act as corporate lawyers with respect to the requisition of the special
    shareholders’ meeting.  McCarthys was
    asked to assist because of a conflict of interest with the corporate secretary
    whose firm, as set out above, had acted as the corporate lawyers.  In February 2008, the appellant also retained
    McCarthys in respect of a private placement.  In March 2008, the corporate secretary resigned and McCarthys then
    attended meetings to act as <i>de facto</i> secretary
    and to provide legal advice as requested.  Finally, on March 25, 2008, the Board unanimously appointed McCarthys as
    corporate lawyers.  Mr. Fuda participated
    in that decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the change of directors in 2008, the appellant
    terminated the retainer of McCarthys.  McCarthys
    delivered seven accounts between February 2008 and February 2009 totalling
    $144,000.  Most of the accounts appeared
    to have been approved by Mr.&nbsp;Conn.  All
    of the accounts were paid, including an account for over $9,000, rendered in
    February 2009, when new management was in control.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Dispute about the Lawyers’ Accounts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 4, 2008, the appellant terminated the
    retainers of all three law firms.  The
    letter terminating the retainers asked the firms to make available the
    company’s books and records as well as files in respect of the firms’
    representation of the appellant.  A
    problem arose in respect of the files held by Lenczners and Voorheis because of
    on-going litigation in which Lenczners continued to act for the five former
    directors.  While this matter was also
    before Brown J., it was adjourned to be dealt with later.  We were told that the issue was recently resolved.  In any event, in my view, the dispute about
    the litigation files does not assist in resolving the question of special
    circumstances that is central to this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first formal written concern raised about the
    firms’ accounts is found in a letter of August 5, 2009, from the appellant’s in-house
    counsel.  In this letter, she stated that
    the appellant was reviewing the firms’ accounts and was willing to discuss a
    negotiated settlement.  The letter did not
    contain any specific allegations concerning the accounts.  In the letter, counsel wrote that to develop
    a proposal for settlement she required the retainer agreements, hourly rates
    and year of call of the lawyers, certain information about disbursements and,
    from Lenczners and Voorheis, detailed dockets.  She also asked the firms if they would consent to an assessment if they were
    not interested in negotiating a reduction of the accounts. Lenczners and
    McCarthys did not provide their retainer letters until shortly before the
    application was heard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant issued its application for an order
    directing a reference of the respondents’ accounts on September 1, 2009.  The application was served on the respondents
    on October 23, 2009.  The affidavit in
    support of the application was made by Charles Edey, the appellant’s new president
    and chief operating officer.  He had not
    been a member of the Board prior to December 2008.  Lawyers from each of the firms swore
    affidavits in the application.  Neither
    Mr. Fuda nor Mr. Conn nor any of the other directors with first-hand knowledge
    of the events of 2007 and 2008 provided any evidence in the application.</p>
  <h4><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>The Reasons of Morawetz J.</span></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and Lenczners and Voorheis relied to some
    extent on the findings made by Morawetz J. in his reasons dismissing the
    application for a declaration that the acquisition by Challenge of the
    appellant’s shares was violation of the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5.  I do not
    intend to review his reasons on the substantive issue.  Of greater interest on this appeal are his
    findings concerning some of the players in the <span class=GramE>litigation.</span>  He found that Mr. Fuda was not a credible
    witness in relation to the negotiations leading up to the acquisition of the
    Challenge shares.  He held that
    “Mr.&nbsp;Fuda would fabricate any version of events, if he believed that it would
    assist his case.”  Near the end of his
    reasons, he characterized one aspect of Mr. Fuda’s conduct as “shameful”
    because of his involvement in the production of a false letter designed to
    exert pressure on the Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morawetz J. made equally devastating findings against
    Mr. Conn.  He noted that Mr. Conn only
    raised concerns about the Challenge shares after Mr. Fuda inquired about the
    gas reserves and took steps to possibly change the composition of the
    Board.  This raised a serious question
    about Mr. Conn’s motives.  He found that
    Mr. Conn’s evidence lacked credibility and was tailored to avoid losing his
    position as an officer and director of the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morawetz J. was also unimpressed with the evidence of
    two of the other directors who testified, including Mr. Moore, who was a member
    of the special committee supervising the litigation.  He found that Mr. Moore and the other
    director, Mr. Hunter, “only seemed to be concerned in taking steps that would
    ensure their continued involvement on the Board at Echo Energy when it became
    clear that their positions were in jeopardy.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Reasons of the Application Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that the evidence of special
    circumstances adduced by the appellant consisted of the assertion that the
    total amount of the legal fees was disproportionate to the company’s financial
    health, and the bald assertions in Mr. Edey’s affidavit “that the three law
    firms ‘were aware or ought to have been aware that the [Five] Directors were
    indifferent to: (a) how the company's money was spent; (b) what the solicitors
    were doing to earn it; (c) whether the work benefited Echo Energy; (d) whether
    the benefit, if any, to Echo Energy was proportional to the legal bills; and,
    (e) whether the company could afford the bills.’”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge referred to the responding
    affidavit of the Lenczners partner with carriage of the litigation.  The partner deposed that he understood a Resolution
    had been passed by the Board confirming that the company would pay the legal
    fees of the appellant and the five directors.  The Lenczner partner further stated that the appellant made no complaint
    about the accounts as they were submitted, and disputed the assertion that the
    five directors were indifferent to the legal expenses incurred by the company.  The application judge quoted an excerpt from
    the affidavit where the partner stated, “The opposite is true as the Five
    Directors were closely involved in all of the steps taken at their direction
    and the direction of Echo Energy.”  The
    application judge also referred to Mr. Voorheis’s affidavit, in which he stated
    that his firm reported to “all clients, or as directed, in a clear and
    transparent manner” and that the appellant never complained about the accounts
    as they were submitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that Mr. Edey’s assertions did
    not establish special circumstances.  He
    considered the context in which the firms provided their services to be
    important.  The appellant and the five
    directors were entitled to defend themselves in the litigation initiated by the
    Fuda group and to launch their own counter-suits.  There was nothing out of the ordinary in a
    corporation retaining special litigation counsel like Voorheis to deal with
    discrete issues that arise in the course of the litigation.  He found that a majority of the Board
    “evidently concluded that it was in the company’s best interests to retain
    Voorheis”.  He saw nothing in the record
    to show that the litigation counsel did anything other than what would be
    expected of counsel and that they acted on the understanding that the appellant
    had agreed to pay them to represent the company and the five directors.  The firms’ accounts were paid in the ordinary
    course without complaint.  He noted that
    new management did not challenge the accounts for eight months.  This delay told against the genuineness of
    the application.  He considered Mr.
    Edey’s complaints to be “oblique” and more about the conduct of the five
    directors than the law firms.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge considered that the argument that
    the firms should have known that the five directors were not acting in the best
    interest of the company was without merit.  He was concerned that companies would find it very difficult to retain
    counsel to defend themselves if the winners of the corporate litigation could
    challenge the accounts of the losing side’s lawyers “for no other <span
class=GramE>reason</span> than that the lawyers provided legal services to the
    losing side”.  He was also concerned that
    allowing the assessment would result in “repetitious litigation, with the end
    of the corporate litigation simply signalling the start of a rehash of all the
    details of the lawsuits through an assessment of the accounts of the losing
    corporation's lawyers.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the appellant’s argument
    that there was a lack of proportionality between the accounts and the
    appellant’s financial resources.  As he
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>According to its financial statements, Echo Energy,
    at the end of 2008, was a company that was asset rich, but revenue thin. Both
    factions thought the company was worth fighting over -- the Fuda Group started
    the litigation war, and the company and the Five Directors responded. <i>Was one faction on the side of the angels
    and the other on the side of the demons? That is not how I read the reasons for
    judgment of Morawetz J.</i> He was highly critical of the credibility of the
    main players on both sides of the dispute. Were the legal costs worth the
    fight? I find it impossible to give credence to new management's &quot;lack of
    proportionality&quot; argument in regards to the company's former lawyers when
    no evidence was placed before me about the legal costs incurred by the Fuda
    Group in this litigation. Both sides were sophisticated business groups who
    could only reasonably expect that hotly contested corporate litigation using
    Toronto counsel would generate large legal bills. Such is the reality of
    contemporary corporate litigation. Given the multiple proceedings and
    attendances involved in the corporate litigation, I see nothing in the amount
    of the challenged bills to suggest, in and of itself, the existence of a
    special circumstance. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the submission that
    there was unnecessary duplication by the work of the three firms.  He also rejected the submission that payment
    by the appellant could not be considered voluntary because the old management
    never really reviewed the accounts for reasonableness.  The application judge believed that the
    starting point for considering that submission must be the perspective of the
    law firms who understood that their accounts had been properly reviewed and
    approved in the ordinary course.  The
    evidence all pointed to the firms operating on the reasonable premise that
    their accounts were appropriate.  Finally, the application judge rejected the submission that the Voorheis
    accounts were not sufficiently detailed.</p>

    decision of the application judge absent an error in principle or a clearly
    unreasonable result: <i>Plazavest Financial Corp.  v. National Bank of Canada</i> (2000), 47 O.R.

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Lenczners and Voorheis Accounts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated, under s. 11 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> a client may obtain an order referring its lawyers’
    paid accounts for assessment only where it demonstrates “special
    circumstances”.  The term “special
    circumstances” is used in other parts of the Act but in the context of s. 11,
    those special circumstances relate to the underlying principle that payment of
    the account implies that the client accepted that the account was proper and
    reasonable: see <i>Enterprise Rent-a-Car Co.
    v. Shapiro, Cohen, Andrews, Finlayson</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 257 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, special circumstances will tend to either
    undermine the presumption that the account was accepted as proper or show that
    the account was excessive or unwarranted.  The appellant relies upon both aspects.  It submits that the presumption was rebutted in this case because the
    person approving the accounts had no real interest in reviewing them and
    ensuring that they were reasonable.  It
    also submits that on their face the accounts are excessive given that a company
    with limited resources spent almost $840,000 in litigation.  I can deal with this latter submission
    summarily.  The appellant adduced no
    evidence that this amount was grossly excessive given the nature and complexity
    of the litigation.  That said<span
class=GramE>,</span> it seems to me that the size of the accounts can be a
    factor to consider under the first leg of special circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cases identify a number of circumstances in which
    the presumption may be rebutted.  For
    example, clients cannot be expected to bring assessment applications while a
    solicitor is still representing them for fear of alienating the solicitor.  Special circumstances may also exist if the
    client makes known its concerns within a reasonable time: see <i>Enterprise Rent-a-Car</i> at p. 265.  However, in the end, <span class=GramE>special
    circumstances is</span> a fact-specific inquiry:  <i>Guillemette
    v. Doucet</i> at para. 4.  Any number of
    factors specific to the particular case can amount to special circumstances if
    they undermine the presumption.  See, for
    example, the reasons of Murray J. in <i>Andrew
    Feldstein &amp; Associates Professional Corp. v. Keramidopulos</i>, [2007] O.J.
    No. 3683 (Sup. Ct. J.), at para. 67.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motions judge erred in principle in
    several respects.  He looked at the case
    from the perspective of the lawyers rather than the client.  He failed to take into consideration evidence
    rebutting the presumption that the client accepted the account as proper and
    reasonable.  And, he relied on a
    speculative theory that lawyers would not undertake this kind of work if they
    knew their accounts might be assessed when new management came in.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge’s lawyer-focused, rather than
    client-focused approach is found in two key passages. In the first passage, the
    application judge considered what he termed the “all-important” context for
    considering the appellant’s assertion that the directors were indifferent to
    how the appellant’s money was spent. Thus the application judge found as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I cannot see any evidence in the record before me
    that the company's litigation counsel did anything other than what one would
    expect from counsel -- &quot;fearlessly to raise every issue, advance every
    argument, and ask every question, however distasteful, which he thinks will
    help his client's case&quot; and to endeavour &quot;to obtain for his client
    the benefit of any and every remedy and defence which is authorized by
    law&quot;: Commentary to Rule 4.01(1) of the <i>Rules of Professional Conduct
    of the Law Society of Upper Canada</i>. <i>Litigation
    counsel did so on the understanding that Echo Energy had agreed to pay for them
    to represent both the company and the Five Directors in the litigation</i>.
    They performed legal services and rendered periodic accounts, which were paid
    by the company in the ordinary course without complaint. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the second passage, the application judge deals
    directly with the assertion that former management never really reviewed the
    accounts. He held as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The starting
    point for considering this submission must be the perspective of the law firms</i>.
    Each of the three firms filed evidence that they understood their submitted
    accounts had been reviewed, approved and paid in the ordinary course; they had
    no reason to understand otherwise. There is no evidence that the law firms exerted
    any pressure on Echo Energy to pay their accounts, or that Echo Energy paid the
    accounts by mistake. <i>The evidence all
    points to the law firms operating on the reasonable premise that by paying
    their bills Echo Energy was satisfied that the services rendered were
    appropriate to the retainers</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the starting point was not the perspective
    of the lawyers.  Section 11 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> attempts to strike a
    balance between a solicitor’s legitimate interest in finality and the client’s
    interest in access to an independent process for review of accounts for legal
    services.  However, the starting point
    ought to be the perspective of the client.  As Murray J. said in <i>Andrew
    Feldstein &amp; Associates Professional Corp. v. Keramidopulos</i>, at para.
    63:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At a time when access to justice is such an
    important issue, and when lawyers' fees are getting so far out of reach for
    many ordinary people, it is crucial that an individual's right to a fair
    procedure for assessment of lawyers' fees exists. As Justice Sharpe said in <span
class=italic1>Price v. Sonsini</span>,
    [<i>Price v. Sonsini</i> (2002), 60 O.R.
    (3d) 257 (C.A.)] public confidence in the administration of justice requires
    the court to intervene where necessary to protect the client's right to a fair
    procedure for assessment of a solicitor's bill. His admonition that solicitors
    should facilitate the assessment process when a client objects to a solicitor's
    account rather than frustrating the process is more than just a guideline for
    law firms. It is essential. Clients must be able to assess their lawyers'
    accounts or they will be or will perceive themselves to be powerless in the
    face of unfair billing practices. There can be little doubt that if the courts
    permit lawyers to avoid scrutiny of accounts in appropriate cases, the
    administration of justice will be brought into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge’s error in taking a law firm
    focused approach led him to conclude that the manner in which the accounts were
    approved did not constitute special circumstances.  By taking this approach, he failed to
    consider the evidence showing that the appellant was not well served by those
    within the company tasked with making the decisions about the conduct of the
    litigation, including payment of the accounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the application judge overlooked evidence
    suggesting that Mr. Conn was spending the appellant’s money without regard for
    the impact on the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected Mr. Edey’s assertions
    that the law firms were aware or ought to have been aware that the five
    directors were indifferent as to how the company’s money was spent, and
    preferred instead the Lenczner lawyer’s affidavit stating that the five
    directors “were closely involved in all the steps taken at their direction and
    the direction of Echo Energy”.  However, while
    the Board had established a special committee to oversee the litigation, there
    were no minutes of meetings showing what steps the committee took to oversee
    the litigation and ensure the reasonableness of the legal fees.  There was also no evidence from any member of
    that committee, merely the assertion from counsel that the five directors were
    not indifferent as to how the appellant’s money was spent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the reasons of Morawetz J. disclose
    troubling conduct and motives of Mr. Conn and Mr. Moore.  Mr. Conn and Mr. Moore were members of the
    special committee that was supposed to be overseeing the litigation and Mr. Conn
    approved the lawyers’ accounts for payment.  Morawetz J. found that many of the witnesses on both sides of litigation
    were not credible in important respects.  But, he made a finding against Mr. Conn that raises the spectre that he
    may not have been acting in the best interests of the corporation.  Morawetz J. was troubled that the issue of the
    propriety of the Challenge share transaction was raised for the first time
    three years after the fact, when the result could be that Mr. Conn and the
    other directors would be ousted from the company.  He said the following at paras. 54 and 55 of
    his reasons, which are reported at (2008), 94 O.R. (3d) 254:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Mr. Conn's
    evidence lacked credibility</i>. <i>In my
    view, Mr.&nbsp;Conn's objective in this lawsuit was to find some way, somehow
    to disqualify Mr. Fuda and Mr. Nepomuceno from being able to vote the Challenge
    Shares</i>. He was aware that their votes could be pivotal and that if counted,
    he would potentially be at risk for his position as a director and officer of
    Echo Energy. In my view, his evidence was tailored to avoid that outcome. <i>There was no complaint until he felt
    threatened and when his future became uncertain, he went on the offensive</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Likewise, I was unimpressed with both Mr. Moore and
    Mr.&nbsp;Hunter. <i>They only seemed to be
    concerned in taking steps that would ensure their continued involvement on the
    Board</i> at Echo Energy when it became clear that their positions were in
    jeopardy.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>And at
    para.</span> 65:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In considering whether the actions of the
    respondents in 2004 should lead to the remedy sought by the applicants, it is,
    in my view, necessary to take into account the fact that a considerable amount
    of what is now being complained of was known to the applicants by 2004, but it
    was conduct that they did not feel the need to investigate or challenge until
    such time as their own positions were being threatened in 2007. <i>The applicants have an interest in
    preserving the status quo. The actions taken by the applicants in launching
    these proceedings must, of necessity, be greeted with a degree of scepticism</i>.
    The remedy being sought is to prohibit Challenge from voting its shares to Echo
    Energy.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated above, Morawetz J. made a similar finding
    against Mr. Moore: that he only seemed concerned about ensuring his continued
    involvement on the Board, rather than coming to grips with a potential problem
    with the gas reserves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these findings, coupled with the apparent
    failure of the special committee to fulfill its function in supervising the
    litigation in a transparent way, go a long way towards establishing special
    circumstances.  Those facts tend to rebut
    the presumption that the appellant accepted the accounts as proper and
    reasonable.  It cannot be forgotten that
    it was the appellant, a public <span class=GramE>company, that</span> was
    paying the bills, not the directors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge made only passing reference to
    the findings of Morawetz J., noting that he was highly critical of the
    credibility of the main players on both sides and that it could not be said
    that one side was on the side of the angels and the other on the side of the
    demons.  He failed to deal with the finding
    by Morawetz J. that Mr.&nbsp;Conn and Mr. Moore may not have had the company’s
    best interests in mind, a finding that could rebut the presumption that the
    company accepted the accounts as proper and reasonable simply because Mr. Conn
    approved the accounts and both he and Mr. Moore were on the special committee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge was also concerned by the fact
    that the appellant waited eight months before raising the issue of the
    appropriateness of the accounts.  The
    application judge was of the view that the eight month silence “speaks volumes
    about the lack of genuineness of the present application to assess the accounts
    of the former lawyers”.  He would have
    expected new management to raise the issue immediately if they had a genuine
    concern about the size of the accounts.  It is unclear to me why the relatively <span class=GramE>short  delay</span> of eight months should have such
    a profound impact.  This is not a case
    where the client waited years before raising the issue: compare, <i>Katana v. McComb Dockrill</i>,<i> </i>[2007] O.J. No. 3194 (Sup. Ct. J.), and<i> Tripkovic v. Glober</i> (2003), 64 O.R.
    (3d) 481 (C.A.).  The relatively brief
    delay equally speaks of some care by new management in seeking to obtain the
    necessary information and understanding the context before moving precipitously.  It is also of some significance that
    Lenczners did not produce its retainer agreement until after the application
    was launched and two days before the application was heard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are other factors that, in my view, point towards
    this being a case of special circumstances.  I would summarize them as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Lenczners written retainer referred only to action
    brought by Challenge, not to any of the other litigation;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The written retainer is signed by Mr. Conn on
    behalf of the appellant, there is no written retainer on behalf of the five
    directors;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was no written retainer with Voorheis;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant had total revenue of $2.8 million
    in 2008, recorded expenses of over $5 million, yet spent almost $840,000 on
    litigation during that period;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relatively short time that elapsed before
    the application was brought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking into consideration all of these factors, the
    appellant made out a case of special circumstances with respect to the accounts
    from Lenczners and Voorheis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge also erred in
    principle in relying on the proposition that lawyers would not take on this kind
    of corporate litigation if new management was able to assess litigation
    counsel’s paid accounts.  I agree with
    the application judge that the court should be wary of cases where the
    application for a reference is nothing more than an attempt by the winning
    party to strike back at the losing party, rather than a genuine concern about
    the reasonableness of the accounts: see <i>Katana
    v. Dockrill</i> (2008), 237 O.A.C. 220, at para. 5.  But, it is quite another thing to say that
    companies will have difficulty retaining counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there is no evidence to support the
    proposition that companies will find it difficult to retain counsel and this
    kind of speculation is inconsistent with the public interest in transparency, fairness
    and reasonableness of solicitors’ accounts.  If the facts on the application show nothing more than an attempt by new
    management to punish old management then the application will be refused
    because special circumstances have not been made out.  I think it would take evidence as opposed to
    speculation to justify the theory that lawyers would abandon lucrative
    corporate litigation for fear they might have to justify their accounts.  And that, of course, is the point of the
    assessment.  Granting the application
    merely sets in motion the opportunity for assessment by an independent and
    neutral third party; it does not mean that counsel will not be paid or that their
    fees are at risk.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have similar concerns about the application judge’s
    observation that to grant the assessment will result in repetitious
    litigation.  The assessment is carried
    out in accordance with well-established principles set out in cases such as <i>Cohen v. Kealey &amp; Blaney</i> (1985), 26
    C.P.C. (2d) 211 (Ont. C.A.).  It is not a
    no-holds-barred rehashing of the previous litigation.  Were it not for the fact that these accounts
    had been paid, the appellant would have had an absolute right to have their
    accounts assessed, provided they brought the application within two years: see <i>Guillemette v. Doucet</i> (2007), 88 O.R.
    (3d) 90 (C.A.), at para. 33.  The exercise
    of the clients’ right to assessment will inevitably prolong the litigation, but
    that is no reason to deprive them of their rights where special circumstances
    have been made out.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The McCarthys Accounts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take a different view of the application to assess
    McCarthys’ accounts.  The appellant has
    pointed to no circumstances that would rebut the presumption of propriety and reasonableness
    arising from the payment of the accounts.  The findings by Morawetz&nbsp;J. and the lack of transparency within the
    special committee do not affect the accounts rendered by McCarthys in its role
    as corporate counsel and <i>de facto </i>secretary
    to the Board.  The appellant adduced no
    evidence to show that the amounts billed were excessive.  The appellant paid McCarthys’ last account,
    without complaint, after the change in management.  The suggestion that there may have been some
    duplication of work with the litigation counsel is not supported by anything in
    the record.  While <span class=SpellE>McCarthys</span> too did not produce its retainer until after the application was launched,
    Mr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Fuda</span> was part of the process retaining
    McCarthys.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, in part, set
    aside the order of Brown J. as it relates to Lenczners and Voorheis and order
    that all accounts rendered by those firms be assessed.  I would dismiss the appeal as it relates to
    McCarthys.  McCarthys is entitled to its
    costs which I would fix at $9,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable
    taxes.  The appellant is entitled to its
    costs as against Lenczners and Voorheis, which I would fix at $11,000 inclusive

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Goudge J.A. (Dissenting):</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the benefit of reading the thorough and
    comprehensive reasons of my colleague Rosenberg J.A. While I agree with his
    disposition of the appeal as it relates to the respondent McCarthy <span
class=SpellE>Tetrault</span> LLP, I would come to a different conclusion on the
    balance of the appeal, and would also dismiss the appeal as it relates to the
    respondents <span class=SpellE>Lenczner</span> <span class=SpellE>Slaght</span> Royce Smith Griffin LLP (<span class=SpellE>Lenczner</span>) and <span
class=SpellE>Voorheis</span> &amp; Co. LLP (<span class=SpellE>Voorheis</span>).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the sole issue is whether the application
    judge committed reversible error in concluding that the appellant did not
    establish the special circumstances required by s. 11 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> to justify the assessment
    of the <span class=SpellE>Lenczner</span> and <span class=SpellE>Voorheis</span> bills it had received and paid. I can find no such error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicable law is not in doubt, and has been
    clearly described by my colleague. To reiterate, because the appellant paid all
    the bills that it now seeks to assess, it must demonstrate facts that rebut the
    common sense inference or presumption that payment of a bill constitutes
    implied acceptance of its reasonableness, particularly when, as here, the bills
    are rendered on a regular basis and paid over the course of several years: see <i>Enterprise Rent-a-Car Co. v. Shapiro, Cohen,
    Andrews, Finlayson</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 257 at 265 (C.A.). The application
    judge, faced with a request to order an assessment in such circumstances, must
    engage in a fact driven exercise of judicial discretion. This court will defer
    to that discretion absent an error in principle or a clearly unreasonable
    result: see <span class=SpellE><i>Guillemette</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Doucet</span> </i>(2007),
    88 O.R. (3d) 90 (C.A.) at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague’s decision turns on his view that the
    application judge erred in principle in three respects. These are concisely set
    out at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 33 of his reasons. I part company on
    each of the three. I read the reasons of the application judge differently, and
    take a different view both of the facts that were before him and his treatment
    of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague finds that the application judge erred in
    principle by looking at the case from the perspective of the lawyers rather
    than the client. At <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 34 and 35 he cites two
    passages from the reasons appealed from to demonstrate this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not agree with his reading of those
    passages or the conclusion he draws from them. In my view, in the first
    passage, the application judge is merely saying that there is nothing in the
    way <span class=SpellE>Lenczner</span> and <span class=SpellE>Voorheis</span> performed their services and billed for them – as there might be in another
    case – that could be advanced by the appellant as special circumstances. This
    is only one of his reasons for finding that no special circumstances were
    proven. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main reason is that he found unsupported the
    assertion that those approving the bills were indifferent to whether they were
    reasonable. I do not think there is anything in the application judge’s
    analysis that suggested that he looked at the appellant’s evidence attempting
    to show indifference, from the perspective of the lawyers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second passage addresses not the assertion of
    indifference, but the argument by the appellant that payment of the accounts
    could not be considered voluntary. In that context, it is understandable that
    the application judge would consider whether there is any evidence that the law
    firms exerted any pressure on the appellant to pay the accounts, or otherwise
    acted in a way that could have induced the appellant to pay by mistake. He
    found no such evidence. In my view that is all that is being referred to in the
    second passage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague also finds that the application judge
    erred in principle in relying on a speculative theory that lawyers would not
    undertake this kind of work if they knew their accounts might be assessed when
    new management came in. I would not read the reasons that way. Rather, I view
    the application judge as merely observing that companies involved in
    intra-corporate litigation would find it very difficult to retain counsel to
    defend themselves if counsel’s accounts could be subjected, after payment, to
    assessment by new management for no reason other than that the lawyers provided
    legal services to the losing side. While this may undoubtedly be a speculative
    prediction, it is hardly unrealistic given the bad blood that often accompanies
    this kind of litigation, as it did in this case. More importantly, I would not
    read the application judge as relying on this to support his conclusion that no
    special circumstances were established. Nor do I see how he could have done so.
    What may happen in the future says nothing about whether there were special
    circumstances in the past. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, my colleague concludes that the application
    judge failed to take into consideration evidence rebutting the presumption that
    the appellant accepted the accounts as being reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most important for him are the three comments of
    Morawetz J. he quotes at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 40. <span class=GramE>For</span> several reasons I cannot agree that these comments assist the appellant in
    rebutting the presumption. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, these comments arise from the proceeding in
    which Morawetz J. heard the claim by the appellant and five directors lead by
    Mr. Conn (the Conn directors) to prohibit those seeking to take over the
    appellant (who ultimately succeeded) from voting their shares in the company.
    This was only one of five pieces of litigation worked on by <span class=SpellE>Lenczner</span> and <span class=SpellE>Voorheis</span>. The others were all commenced by those
    seeking the takeover, against the company and/or the Conn directors, forcing
    them to defend themselves. These comments can address only one of the pieces of
    litigation covered by these accounts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the first two comments by Morawetz J. are
    simply about the way Conn, Moore and Hunter gave evidence in that case and
    their self-interested motive in doing so. I do not think these comments can be
    taken as judicial findings about their evidence in any of the other pieces of
    litigation, let alone their motivation in taking any decisions on behalf of the
    appellant. While the claim that they took any such decisions without the
    company’s best interest in mind may well be an issue in the litigation
    commenced by the appellant against them (after the takeover) for breach of
    fiduciary duty, that issue was not before Morawetz J. and I would not take
    these two comments as addressing it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third comment is about the applicants who commenced
    the proceeding before Morawetz J. and their interest in doing so to preserve
    the status quo. The appellant was one of those applicants. I do not view these
    comments as being only about the five Conn directors. Indeed there can be no
    doubt that up until the takeover, the appellant and the five Conn directors
    shared the same interest, namely to oppose the takeover and preserve the status
    quo. They had the same lawyers whose instructions were to vigorously advance
    that interest for all of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To put <span class=GramE>this another</span> way, it is
    important to underline that the presumption that the appellant must rebut is
    that when it paid the accounts, that is presumed to reflect its acceptance of
    the reasonableness of those accounts. It is the appellant’s acceptance at the
    time of payment that matters. There is no doubt that, at that time, the
    appellant considered it in its best interest to resist the attempted at
    takeover by the <span class=SpellE>Fuda</span> group by vigorously defending
    the litigation brought by that group and by commencing the proceeding before
    Morawetz J.  The Conn directors,
    including Mr. Conn, shared the same interest. I do not think anything said by
    Morawetz J. can be taken to suggest that Mr. Conn and Mr. Moore may not have
    had the company’s best interest in mind when the accounts were approved.  They shared that interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there can be no suggestion that, at that
    time, the interest of Mr. Conn and the best interest of the appellant (as it
    saw it) were in conflict. The fact that after the takeover, the company took
    the opposite position about what was in its best interest at that time is no
    more than the client changing its mind. As such, it does not rebut the
    presumption or otherwise constitute special circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would also differ with my colleague’s view that the
    application judge overlooked evidence that sustains the conclusion that the
    special committee set up by the appellant to supervise the litigation
    apparently failed to fulfill its function. Nor do I think that evidence would
    tend to rebut to presumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read the evidence, it is simply that the new
    president can find no records of any work by the <span class=GramE>committee,</span> something that is true of many of the appellant’s other corporate records,
    which also cannot be located. I do not take the absence of evidence of these
    corporate records as positive evidence that there were no such records, nor
    that the committee failed to do its job. More importantly, the evidence of Mr.
    Curry was that the accounts were considered by the appellant’s management, and
    reviewed and paid in the normal course. Even if the committee failed to fulfill
    its function, that does not tend to show that the accounts were not authorized
    after proper review by those with authority to do so, and therefore does not go
    to rebut the presumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor, in my view, are special circumstances pointed to
    by the absence of written retainers for much of the litigation, the net revenue
    of the appellant compared to the amount of the accounts, or the time before the
    application was brought. There is no assertion that <span class=SpellE>Lenczner</span> and <span class=SpellE>Voorheis</span> were not properly retained. The accounts
    were not excessive and the net revenue comparison does not undermine the
    appellant’s clear position when it paid them that <span class=GramE>its</span> best interest required the litigation to be vigorously defended by skilled
    counsel. Neither this comparison nor the timing of the application <span
class=GramE>speak</span> to whether those approving payment were indifferent to
    their reasonableness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, I do not think that the application judge
    overlooked any evidence that would tend to rebut the presumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning briefly to the application judge’s reasons for
    finding that no special circumstances were proven by the appellant, I see no
    basis for appellate intervention. The affidavit evidence of indifference by
    those approving payment offered by the appellant was no more than a bald
    assertion by someone who was not with the appellant at the time. Moreover that
    assertion was flatly contradicted by counsel who dealt with those who approved
    payment. There was ample basis for the application judge to find that the
    indifference alleged was not established. That finding of fact attracts
    appellate deference, and I would not interfere with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal in its
    entirety.</p>
