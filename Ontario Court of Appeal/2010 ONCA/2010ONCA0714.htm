    representation for a child is required or the judge requires further
    information concerning the child’s needs in a custody dispute, the general
    practice is to make an order of referral to the Office of the Children’s Lawyer
    (OCL) <i>requesting</i> the Children’s
    Lawyer to provide such services under ss. 89(3.1) and 112 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C.43<i> </i>(<i>CJA</i>), as she deems appropriate.  In the cases under appeal, a Superior Court
    judge exercised the court’s <i>parens
    patriae </i>jurisdiction and <i>ordered</i> the OCL to act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCL appeals these orders and asks that they be set
    aside.  The OCL asks that an order in the
    standard form requesting her involvement be substituted or held to be the
    prevailing order in those appeals where an order in the standard form
    requesting the OCL’s to act was made either concurrently with or subsequent to
    the order in the exercise of the <i>parens
    patriae </i>jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For ease of reference ss. 89(3.1) and 112 of the <i>CJA </i>are reproduced below: </p>

    (Canada) or the Children’s Law Reform Act in which a question concerning
    custody of or access to a child is before the court, the Children’s Lawyer may
    cause an investigation to be made and may report and make recommendations to
    the court on all matters concerning custody of or access to the child and the
    child’s support and education.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)      The Children’s Lawyer may act under
    subsection (1) on his or her own initiative, at the request of a court or at
    the request of any person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)        An
    affidavit of the person making the investigation, verifying the report as to
    facts that are within the person’s knowledge and setting out the source of the
    person’s information and belief as to other facts, with the report attached as
    an exhibit thereto, shall be served on the parties and filed and on being filed
    shall form part of the evidence at the hearing of the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       Where a party to the proceeding disputes
    the facts set out in the report, the Children’s Lawyer shall if directed by the
    court, and may when not so directed, attend the hearing on behalf of the child and
    cause the person who made the investigation to attend as a witness.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span><i><span style='line-height:200%'>CJA</span></i> and, if that request was refused, asked the OCL to reconsider its refusal or to
    consider other alternatives.  The OCL’s
    position is further that the Superior Court judge could only invoke the court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction to fill a
    legislative gap which, the OCL submits, does not exist in light of ss. 89(3.1)
    and 112 of the <i>CJA</i>.  Thus, the judge could not order the OCL to
    act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the court had the power to exercise <span
class=GramE>its <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae</i> jurisdiction, the OCL submits
    that that jurisdiction ought not to be exercised as, to do so, would open the
    “floodgates” and the OCL would be unable to function properly.  At the oral hearing before us, the OCL sought
    leave to introduce fresh evidence in the form of an affidavit by Ms. Denal
    Moyal, the Legal Director of the Personal Rights Department and acting Children’s
    Lawyer at the time.  The intervener,
    Justice for Children and Youth (JFCY) consented to the affidavit being filed as
    fresh evidence.  In her affidavit, Ms.
    Moyal deposed that between April 1, 2009 and August 25, 2010, the OCL received
    5,548 referrals from judges across Ontario.  Of those, 1,873 were from the Ontario Court of Justice and 3,673 were
    from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  Five hundred and eighty-two of the 5,548 referrals came from judges
    sitting in Northern Ontario.  Sixty-eight
    per cent of these orders were made by Ontario Court of Justice judges.  During this same period, the OCL accepted a
    total of 3,432 cases across Ontario.  Based on this affidavit, the thrust of the OCL’s argument appears to be
    that if Superior Court judges do have <i>parens
    patriae </i>jurisdiction and exercise it in the manner the Superior Court judge
    has done in these cases, the OCL would be ordered to act in so many cases that
    it would no longer be able to meet the requests made by Ontario Court of
    Justice judges, (who do not have <i>parens
    patriae</i> jurisdiction) particularly those in Northern Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>JFCY takes no position on the particular cases before
    the court.  Having regard to the United
    Nations<i> Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, </i>Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3,<i> </i>to
    which Canada is a signatory, JFCY takes the position that children have a right
    to be heard in the legal proceedings that affect them and that it is the duty
    of the court to ensure this happens.  JFCY
    acknowledges that the right to be heard does not mean that children have a
    right to legal representation in all cases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>JFCY’s position is aligned with that of the OCL to the
    extent that, even in exigent circumstances, JFCY submits that a judge of the
    Superior Court must request the involvement of the OCL.  If that request is refused, the judge may
    request reconsideration by the OCL or consider other practicable alternatives.  However, after considering the practicability
    of other avenues, JFCY submits that the judge may make an order in the exercise
    of the Superior Court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction,
    either ordering the OCL to act or appointing counsel to be paid for by the
    Attorney General if the child’s parents are unable to pay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> JFCY submits
    that when the OCL refuses to assist the court, a gap in the <i>CJA </i>exists because the Act does not
    specify how the child is to be heard.  In
    addition, JFCY argues that there is a gap in the legislation because no
    statutory right of appeal exists from a decision of the OCL.  In the situation where the OCL refuses to act,
    it is incumbent on the judge to consider what other steps are appropriate so
    that the child can be heard.  Where no
    other statutory or procedural avenues for obtaining input from the child are
    practicable, and the proceeding is in the Superior Court, JFCY submits that the
    court can exercise its <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction
    and order legal representation for the child.  JFCY relies on a combination of the <i>Convention, </i>existing legislation, and
    jurisprudence to the effect that the court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction is founded on the necessity for the court
    to act, from time to time, for the protection of vulnerable persons and in
    their best interests.  Just as the common
    law has evolved to protect the interests of third parties in the possession of
    documentary information through <i>O’Connor</i> applications,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> JFCY submits that a similar procedure could evolve to protect the best
    interests of children who are affected parties in their parents’ custody
    disputes and to give them an opportunity to be represented by counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, JFCY submits that judicial review of the
    OCL’s decision may lie if there is evidence, for example, that she has acted
    unfairly.  In support of its position, JFCY
    relies by analogy on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Beson v. Newfoundland (Director of Child
    Welfare)</i>,<i> </i>[1982] 2 S.C.R. 716 at

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, JFCY observes that while the application of a
    court’s discretionary jurisdiction has traditionally been limited to
    circumstances where there is a gap in the legislative scheme, recent case law
    suggests that a legislative gap may not always be a necessary precursor to the
    exercise of the <span class=GramE>court’s</span> <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction.  In <i>A.A. v. B.B.</i> (2007), 83
    O.R. (3d) 561 (C.A.), at para. 40, Rosenberg J.A. held that he would not
    foreclose the possibility that the exercise of the <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction did not depend upon a legislative gap
    if that was the only way to meet the paramount objective of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C. 12, namely, the best interests of the child.   </p>

    aside an order of the judge ordering the OCL to prepare an update of its

    made.  More recently, in <i>Novoa v. Molero </i>(2007), 45 R.F.L. (6th)
    267, this court again held that both ss. 89(3.1) and 112 of the <i>CJA </i>are permissive, not imperative, and
    accordingly, the OCL has the discretion to decide whether to cause an
    investigation to be made and whether to report and make recommendations to the
    court on the matters of custody and access.  The court also considered whether the OCL had an obligation to provide
    reasons in the exercise of its discretion and concluded that no such obligation

Parens patriae is the power of the court to act in the stead of a parent for the protection of a child.  Prior to the amendment to the Courts of Justice Amendment Act, 1984, S.O. 1987, c. 1, in 1987, s. 125 of the CJA required the official guardian to do an investigation and report to the court in every divorce action in which there was a child of the marriage, regardless of whether there was a claim made for custody or access to the child or whether there was any dispute respecting custody or access.  Hansard records that the amendments to the Act meant that an automatic Official Guardian&rsquo;s report would no longer have to be filed.  There is no discussion as to what happens in the event that the Official Guardian, now the OCL, refuses to act:  see 1994 c. 12 s. 37 and 1999 c. 12 Sch. B s. 4(1) respectively.  Similarly, when the provisions giving the Children&rsquo;s Lawyer the discretion to act as the legal representative of a child were introduced and later amended, there is no discussion in Hansard as to what is to happen in the event that representation is refused.

    the Supreme Court of Canada reviewed the history and application of the <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction and held, at

    unlimited, it by no means follows that the discretion to exercise it is
    unlimited.  It must be exercised in
    accordance with underlying principle.  Simply put, the discretion is to do what is necessary for the protection
    of the person for whose benefit it is exercised.”  Earlier in its reasons, the court held, at p. <span
class=GramE>426, that</span> <i>parens
    patriae </i>jurisdiction is “founded on necessity, namely the need to act for
    the protection of those who cannot care for themselves.” The court concluded, “[T]he
    categories under which the jurisdiction can be exercised are never closed … the

    delineate when the exercise of the Superior Court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction is appropriate.  In <i>D.N.
    (Litigation guardian of) v. Children’s Aid Society of the Niagara Region</i>,<i> </i>[2004] O.J. No. 5085 (C.A.), the court
    held it was proper for the Superior Court applications judge to decline
    jurisdiction on judicial review of the order of the Ontario Court of Justice
    given the availability of an effective alternative remedy in the proceedings
    before the provincial court.  In that
    context, this court observed, at para. 3, that the Superior Court “will only
    exercise <span class=GramE>its <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae </i>jurisdiction, whether by <i>habeas corpus </i>or otherwise, where there
    is a gap in the legislative scheme.”  The
    brief endorsement of the court in <i>D.N. </i>does
    not indicate there was any argument on<i> </i>the
    question of whether the court could only exercise <span class=GramE>its <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae </i>jurisdiction when a gap in the legislation exists.  The responding party to the Children’s Aid
    Society’s appeal was self represented.  Having
    regard to these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that in <i>C.R. v. Children’s Aid Society of Hamilton </i>(2004),
    8 R.F.L. (6th) 285 (Ont. S.C.), Czutrin J. came to the conclusion that reading
    the Court of Appeal’s recent decisions in such a manner as to suggest that a
    legislative gap was the <i>only</i> method
    by which the <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction
    could be exercised was simply too narrow.  At the same time, he made it clear that the exercise of the discretion
    should not be the first “go to” solution but, in most cases, the last. He
    concluded at para. 129:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Parens

    case.  In fact, it should be discouraged
    and be a remedy of last resort in most cases.  However, in the proper circumstances <i>where
    the society has not acted fairly or otherwise met the needs of children</i>,
    the inherent <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction

    the court had the benefit of argument from an <i>amicus</i> <i>curiae.</i>  The issue before the court in <i>A.A. v. B.B. </i>was whether the
    non-biological parent of a child born to a couple in a lesbian relationship
    could also be recognized as a mother of the child.  The court first considered whether the
    Superior Court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction
    needed to be exercised to rescue a child in danger.  Having concluded that this was not the case,
    Rosenberg J.A. turned to the question of whether a gap in the legislation
    existed.  At para. 27, <i> </i>Rosenberg
    J.A. held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    court’s inherent <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction
    may be applied to rescue a child in danger <i>or </i>to bridge a legislative gap. This is not a case about a child being in
    danger. If the <i>parens patriae</i> authority were to be exercised it would have to be on the basis of a legislative
    gap. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court agreed with the application judge that the
    wording of the <i>CLRA</i> did not enable
    the court to make a declaration that the child had a second mother.  The issue then was whether the court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction could be
    exercised to fill a legislative gap or whether the <i>CLRA </i>was intended to be a complete code with the result that any
    gap was deliberate.  Having regard to the
    purpose and scheme of the Act, which was the best interests of the child, the
    court held that it was contrary to the child’s best interests to be deprived of
    the legal recognition of the parentage of one of its mothers, that a
    legislative gap existed, and that the only way to fill that gap was to exercise
    its <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction and
    make the declaration sought.  In his
    reasons on behalf of the court, Rosenberg J.A. referred to the comments of
    Czutrin J. in <i>C.R</i>.,<i> </i>and refused to foreclose the
    possibility that the court could exercise its <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction in the absence of a gap in the
    legislation if that was the only way to meet the legislation’s paramount
    objective, which, as he had stated earlier, was the best interests of the
    child. </p>

    v. B.B.</i> illustrates the principle that <span class=GramE>the <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae</i> jurisdiction can be used to fill a legislative gap.  Another principle emerges from the discussion
    in <i>A.A. v. B.B., </i>namely that the
    exercise of <span class=GramE>the <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae </i>jurisdiction to second guess a
    decision within the mandate of the statutory authority would be an inappropriate
    exercise of <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction, with the exception, perhaps, of judicial review, if appropriate:  see para. 30 citing the reasons of Lord
    Wilberforce in <i>A. v. Liverpool City
    Council and another</i>,<i> </i>[1981] 2 All
    E.R. 385 (H.L.) at 388-89, to the effect that the court’s general inherent
    power is always available to fill gaps or to supplement the powers of the
    statutory authority but the court should not supervise the exercise of
    discretion within the field committed by statute to the particular authority, except
    perhaps, by judicial review where appropriate.  See also para. 36 respecting <i>Beson.</i></p>

    wherein the OCL was ordered “to appear and represent the interests of the
    child”.  The mother, who was her six-
    year old son’s primary caregiver, took the child with her to Trinidad and
    overstayed three months.  At the time,
    she was pregnant.  The father obtained an
    order requiring the mother to return the child to Ontario and an interim order
    for sole custody.  The mother was granted
    access but could only exercise that access in the presence of a security guard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the return of the father’s motion for custody in
    October, the mother had had her baby.  The parties disputed whether the mother’s overstay was due to valid
    medical issues connected to her second pregnancy and her alleged consequent
    inability to travel, or whether she had abducted the child.  The father alleged that the mother said things
    to the child in an attempt to alienate him from the father.  The child whose custody was in issue had not
    seen his mother for over two months. The mother alleged that the child was
    suffering harm as a result of the change to his custody.  Although six years old, he had recently
    started wearing training diapers again.   </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    don’t intend to serve the child of this relationship ill and I do not intend to
    conclude that this court is hampered in exercising <span class=GramE>its <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae</i> jurisdiction to rescue a child in danger. I am satisfied
    that the child in this case is, in fact, in danger – in danger of parental
    alienation, in danger of not being able to see his mother in circumstances
    which, at present, are bordering on the unconscionable albeit, perhaps
    necessary, on a short term basis.  I have
    no intention of failing to act to help a child who needs the court’s protection
    who cannot speak for himself without the assistance of an independent,
    objective and expert assistant to assist the court by representing him and I
    have no intention of letting this matter slide.  Counsel for the Office of the Children’s
    Lawyer recommended that the matter take its ordinary course.  So far, as I know, the parties have not yet
    filled out the form.  If they fill out
    the form perhaps the Office of the Children’s Lawyer – they filled out the form
    now, of course, but had not filled out the form as required by the Order of Justice
    Kelly. Whether or not the Office of the Children’s Lawyer chooses to provide
    their usual service is fine with me; if they choose to provide their usual
    service, so much the better.  What I am
    ordering them to do is to consider my direction, as provided on the consent of
    the parties, but appear in court from now, and until relieved by the court, to
    assist the court with respect to every step in this case involving the child.</span></p>

    the Superior Court judge considered the child to be in danger, the child was
    not in the kind of danger which would warrant intervention by the Children’s
    Aid Society (CAS).  In fact, as of the
    continuation of the motion, the CAS had investigated and found that CAS
    intervention was not warranted.  The
    Superior Court judge indicated that this confirmed his opinion that the OCL was
    best suited to deal with the issues in this case. </span></p>

    the mother could exercise access.  The
    parties had contacted a number of custody and access centers in Peel and Toronto,
    but could not even get an initial interview until almost a month from the date

    that the child was in danger although the recent CAS investigation had
    concluded that the child was not in need of protection or danger in that sense.
     Although not reflected in his reasons,
    the danger the Superior Court judge was concerned about was the danger to the
    child’s emotional well-being because he was unable to see his mother owing to
    the administrative lacuna that made the order for supervised access impossible
    to carry out.</p>

    OCL’s lawyer in court gave him reason to think it might decline to take the
    case.  Nevertheless, he ought not to have
    pre-empted the OCL’s statutory discretion by exercising his <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction and at the

    caregiver of the children, brought a motion for custody of her two children,
    aged seven and ten.  The mother and
    father had a history of conflict.  The
    mother alleged that the father was controlling and abusive.  She and the children had moved to a shelter at
    one point, but the parties reconciled a year later, and she and the children
    moved back into the matrimonial home.  Shortly
    thereafter, the parties got into a struggle over the mother’s cell phone and
    the father called the police, alleging that she had hit him.  The mother was charged with assault and was
    forced to leave the matrimonial home.  The

    understand English.  Referring to the
    intake form the OCL requires that a party fill out prior to considering whether
    it will act, the Superior Court judge stated that “filling out the forms will
    be a nightmare” and that the time taken to fill out the forms is too long.  There followed an exchange about whether or
    not the OCL requires both parties to fill out the form.  The OCL maintained this was not the case.  The Superior Court judge stated that he had
    been told many times that the OCL had declined to take a file because one side
    or the other side has not filled out the form within “x” number of days.  Although the Superior Court judge eventually

    professes not to speak English.  And
    delaying an investigation of such a matter is highly inappropriate.  Children, vulnerable children, who are asking
    -- where one parent is asking for the court to intervene where the parties
    cannot agree themselves, the children may suffer by virtue of delay, and I am
    satisfied that this court is obliged to exercise its jurisdiction to protect
    children.  It’s the highest duty the
    court has in all of its responsibilities, the responsibilities of ensuring that
    children are properly cared for.  That’s
    the court’s high responsibility and I will not—unless I am corrected or
    reversed, I will not stop requiring the Office of the Children’s Lawyer in

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The allegations before the Superior Court judge were
    indeed troubling.  As the Supreme Court
    indicated in <i>Re. Eve</i> and this court
    stated in <i>A.A. v. B.B., </i>the need to
    rescue a child is an appropriate exercise of the <span class=GramE>court’s</span> <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction.  However, as the Superior Court judge noted,
    the father’s allegations of excessive force by the mother against the children
    were unsworn.  The court cannot act on
    unsworn evidence.  The judge could have
    told the father this.  He could also have
    told the father that a proceeding concerning possession of the matrimonial home
    was not a custody proceeding and that the issue of custody of the children was
    not before him.  The Superior Court judge
    could have enquired whether the father had made the CCAS aware of his
    allegations and asked what other, if any, steps the father had taken based on
    his observation of the alleged bruise on his two-year-old son’s arm and his
    eldest son’s complaint.  For example, had
    he sought an explanation from the mother?  Had he taken his two-year-old son to the doctor and had him examined?  Also, as the Superior Court judge had his
    registrar call the CCAS, the CCAS would have been alerted to the Superior Court
    judge’s concerns as to their danger.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superior Court judge ought to have dealt with the
    application on the evidence before him, at least on an interim basis, even if he
    was of the opinion that at a later date, when a permanent custody order was
    made, the mother might not have custody of the children.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  The evidence indicated the CCAS was
    involved and had chosen not to remove the children from the mother’s care.  Having regard to the interim custody order in
    favour of the mother, as well as the need of the eldest child to attend a
    special needs school and the fact that he had been attending such a school near
    the matrimonial home, would it not have been in the best interests of the
    eldest child to return to that school and to live in the matrimonial home on an
    interim basis pending any final outcome of the case?  Was there no urgency in this regard?  Would it not have been in all of the
    children’s best interests not to live in a shelter but in familiar
    surroundings? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would simply set aside the order of the Superior

  <h3><i>A.C.B. v. R.B. C52167</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is an appeal of the order made April 1,
    2010, wherein the OCL was ordered to “investigate and report on the issue of
    custody and access of this child, or show cause within 30 days why it would not
    be appropriate for it to do so.”  The
    parties submitted minutes of settlement and requested an order respecting
    custody and access regarding their nine-year-old daughter.  The agreement allowed for supervised access by
    the father at the discretion of the mother “depending on her (the child’s)
    reaction to visits taking into consideration her wishes”.  The father, who had been found not criminally
    responsible for the murder of his own father, was a patient at Centre for
    Addiction and Mental Health and was subject to a Detention Order made by the
    Ontario Review Board. The Superior Court judge found that the information
    provided was insufficient to permit approval of the requested order.  While there was nothing in the material filed
    that expressly stated that the child might be in danger, it may well be
    inferred from the history of the father and the terms of access.  The Superior Court judge observed that the
    passage of Bill 133 (the <i>Family Statute Law
    Amendment Act, 2009</i>, S.O. 2009, c. 11) now required an applicant for
    custody or access to file an affidavit (Form 35.1) containing the applicant’s
    proposed plan for the child’s care and upbringing, information respecting the
    applicant’s current or previous involvement in any family or criminal
    proceedings, and any other information known to the person that was relevant to
    the court’s decision. At paras. 10-11, he held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There appears to be a legislative gap inherent in
    the process now in place. Where independent evidence of the best interests of a
    child is required, the court has no process available to it to obtain such
    evidence, lacking an investigatory arm or service, other than by requesting or
    requiring that such evidence be produced by the agencies generally responsible
    for protecting children. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It appears to me that the court must exercise <span
class=GramE>its <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae </i>jurisdiction in this case to
    ensure that the best interests of the child are protected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superior Court judge also issued a publication ban
    of the names of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By this time the issue of whether the Superior Court
    judge could order, as opposed to request the OCL to act, was the subject of
    appeal, with the OCL taking the position that he could not.  The OCL refused to consider the case as no
    standard form order requesting its involvement was received.  The parties requested and consented to a
    standard form order but the Superior Court judge declined to make it.  A stay pending appeal was granted by the Court
    of Appeal for Ontario on July 16, 2010.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “danger” that the Superior Court judge was
    concerned about was not the kind of danger that required the exercise of the
    court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction;
    the court had available to it other means to obtain the information it sought.  For the same reason, I would also hold that
    the Superior Court judge erred in concluding that there appeared to be a gap in
    the legislative process.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was a custody and access proceeding before the
    court that the parties had resolved and they were seeking a consent court
    order.  I see no reason why the Superior
    Court judge could not have requested the OCL to act pursuant to s. 112 of the <i>CJA</i> which, it will be recalled, provides
    that in a proceeding under the <i>Divorce
    Act </i>or the <i>CLRA </i>concerning
    custody or access, the Children’s Lawyer may cause an investigation to be made
    at the request of the court, its own initiative or that of a party.  As for the trial judge’s reference to the <i>Family Statute Law Amendment Act, 2009</i>,
    I note that it is not a free-standing authority and that the governing
    legislation was the <i>CLRA</i>, to which
    s.112 of the <i>CJA </i>applies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and in its place
    substitute an order in the standard form.</p>

    an appeal of the order of the Superior Court judge dated May 3, 2010, wherein
    the OCL was ordered to “investigate and report”.  The parties in this case agreed that the OCL
    should be involved.  The parties
    described their separation as “high conflict”; however, they continued to
    reside in the same house.  The CAS had
    previously been involved.  The children,
    ages 15 and 12, were responding negatively to the stress of the separation.  The mother alleged that the father put the
    children under enormous pressure and that he tried to bribe them to take his
    side in the custody dispute.  The father
    alleged that the mother had a temper and had been previously charged with
    assaulting her own mother.  The children’s
    paediatrician stated that the youngest child’s behavioural problems were
    largely attributable to the stress in the home.<span lang=EN-US

    as soon as reasonably possible.  He

  <h3><i>Feldman v Boue C52169</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal of the order of the Superior Court
    judge dated May 4, 2010, wherein the OCL was ordered to “investigate and
    report”.  Another Superior Court judge
    had previously made an order in the standard form in October 2009, but the OCL
    refused to become involved.  There is no
    indication in the record as to why.  On
    February 3, 2010, a Superior Court judge again made an order requesting OCL
    involvement.  The parties were advised
    that the case could not be considered without a recent standard form order.  According to the Superior Court judge whose
    order is under appeal, the OCL took the position that the February 3 order was
    not sufficient for them to open a file.  (Although
    it is unclear, the Superior Court judge’s comment may have been an oblique
    reference to the Notice to the Profession stipulating that if an intake form is
    not received within 10 days after an order requesting involvement is made, the
    OCL will not provide any service.  The
    Court then has to make a fresh order requesting involvement.)  More than three months had passed since the
    original order and the Superior Court judge was of the opinion the children
    were suffering prejudice as a result of the delay.  Therefore, again citing <i>A.C.B. v. R. B., </i>the Superior Court judge held it was necessary to
    exercise the court’s <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction.
     The Superior Court judge made a further
    order on May 4, 2010, mandating the OCL to investigate and report and also made
    an order in the standard form on the same date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCL received one intake form.  The case was refused by the OCL on May 14,
    2010, after applying the usual intake criteria.  The OCL’s position was that it could not offer meaningful assistance as
    the children were older and the main issues between the parties were financial
    and parenting issues (i.e. payment under the <i>Child Support Guidelines </i>for
    s. 7 expenses, which parent would help with homework, etc.).  A stay of <span class=GramE>the <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae </i>order pending appeal was granted on June 3, 2010.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is very little information in the record about
    the facts of this case.  The Superior
    Court judge again erred in principle by initiating a parallel procedure to
    circumvent the OCL’s intake procedures and to preclude it from exercising its
    discretion meaningfully.  Having regard
    to the comment in the OCL’s factum that the children were older, he could have
    considered the making of an order for independent representation pursuant to r.
    4(7) of the <i>Family Law Rules </i>or an
    order pursuant to s. 30 of the <i>CLRA</i>.  Inasmuch as he did not do so, I would set
    aside the order made pursuant to the exercise of the <span class=GramE>court’s</span> <i>parens patriae </i>power.     </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These appeals did not require the court to engage in a
    theoretical discussion about whether the Superior Court’s <i>parens patriae </i>power could be used to order the OCL to act.  Assuming, without deciding, that Superior
    Court judges can, in the appropriate circumstances, exercise <span class=GramE>their <i>parens</i></span><i> patriae </i>jurisdiction to order the OCL to act, that jurisdiction
    ought not to have been exercised in these six appeals.  The Superior Court judge ought to have
    respected the structure of ss. 89 (3.1) and 112 in the <i>CJA</i>, which give the OCL discretion in considering requests for
    their involvement.  He ought not to have
    circumvented the existing statutory structure for engaging the OCL.  Prior to exercising his <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction to make an order, it was incumbent on
    the Superior Court judge to consider and avail himself of the other available
    avenues for assistance that were responsive to the specific factual problems
    before him.  Accordingly, I would allow
    the appeals in the manner indicated.</p>
