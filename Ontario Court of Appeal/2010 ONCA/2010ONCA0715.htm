  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the interpretation of the <i>Carriage by Air Act</i>, R.S. 1985, c. C-26,
    implementing the <i>Convention for the
    Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air</i>, 12
    October 1929, 137 L.N.T.S. 11 (the “Warsaw Convention”), which regulates
    liability for the international carriage of persons and property by air.  The text of the Warsaw Convention is in
    French.  Article 29 of the Warsaw Convention
    provides that an action “doit être intentée” (meaning “must be brought”) within
    two years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Articles 28 and 29 of the Warsaw Convention read as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'><span lang=FR-CA>Article 28</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=FR-CA>(1) L’action en responsabilité devra être
    portée, au choix du demandeur, dans le territoire d’une des Hautes Parties
    Contractantes…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=FR-CA>(2) La procédure sera réglée par la loi du
    tribunal saisi.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'><span lang=FR-CA>Article 29</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=FR-CA>(1) L’action en responsabilité doit être
    intentée, sous peine de déchéance, dans le délai de deux ans à compter de
    l’arrivée à destination ou du jour où l’aéronef aurait dû arriver, ou de
    l’arrêt du transport.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=FR-CA>(2)
    Le mode du calcul du délai est déterminé par la loi du tribunal saisi.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The English text of articles 28 and 29, as implemented
    in the <i>Carriage by Air Act</i>, reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center;page-break-after:
avoid'>Article 28</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) An action for damages must be brought, at the
    option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting
    Parties…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) Questions of procedure shall be governed by the
    law of the Court seized of the case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>Article 29</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) The right to damages shall be extinguished if
    an action is not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at
    the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived,
    or from the date on which the carriage stopped.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The method of calculating the period of
    limitation shall be determined by the law of the Court seized of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the respondents issued a notice of action
    against the appellant, Ukraine International Airlines, and others regarding the
    destruction of documents contained in an Air France jet that overran the runway
    and caught fire at Pearson International Airport.  The notice of action was issued within the
    two-year limitation period.  However, the
    respondents were not successful in serving the claim on the appellant within
    the six-month period provided in Ontario’s<i> Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents brought an <i>ex parte</i> motion before Master Sproat for an order extending the
    time for service.  Master Sproat
    adjourned the motion for notice to be served on the appellant and the other
    defendants who had not yet been served.  The motion later returned for hearing before Master Hawkins, who granted
    the extension of time <i>nunc pro tunc</i>.  The appellant did not appear on the motions.  The master’s decision to extend time was
    consistent with this court’s decision in <i>Brown
    v. Humble</i>, [1959] O.R.  586 (C.A.).   The appellant brought a motion for
    reconsideration before Master Dash.  The
    basis of the motion was that notice was never received by the appellant or, in
    the <span class=GramE>alternative, that</span> the appellant failed to attend
    through mistake or insufficient notice.  Master Dash confirmed the decision, and a further appeal to the
    Divisional Court was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the court below, the primary issue was whether the
    respondents had “brought” the action when the statement of claim was issued or
    only when service of the claim was <span class=GramE>effected</span>.  The appellant now concedes that the action
    was brought upon issuance of the claim and that this occurred within the
    two-year limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the issue is presented somewhat
    differently.  The appellant argues that
    the extension of time was improper because the statement of claim had expired
    due to the failure to <span class=GramE>effect</span> service before the
    extension was obtained and that given the language of article 29, the claim had
    expired and could not be revived.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the rule in <i>Brown v. Humble</i> has no application to a
    claim brought under the Warsaw Convention.  <i>Brown v. Humble </i>dealt with a
    statutory limitation period.  In common
    law jurisdictions, the expiry of a statutory limitation period does not
    extinguish the underlying claim, but rather creates a procedural bar to
    proceeding with the claim.  The appellant
    submits that the two-year period laid down by the article 29 has a
    fundamentally different character and that after two years, the claim is
    extinguished.  It follows, in the
    appellant’s submission, that when the statement of claim expired for want of
    service after the two year prescription in article 29 had expired, the Warsaw
    Convention claim was extinguished and there was nothing to revive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  In
    our view, once a claim is issued within the two-year limitation period, article
    29 of the Warsaw Convention has been satisfied and the claim then falls to be governed
    by the procedure in the jurisdiction where the claim has been issued.  Any subsequent procedural requirements,
    including those relating to the time for service or renewal of the statement of
    claim, are governed by the <i>Rules</i>.  This is apparent from article 28(2) of the Warsaw
    Convention, which specifically provides that the procedure of the court seized
    of the claim governs.  Indeed, the very
    requirement that service must be <span class=GramE>effected</span> within six months
    is provided for by the Ontario <i>Rules</i>,
    not by the terms of the Warsaw Convention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 3.02 of the <i>Rules </i>allows for the extension of time for service if the motion is brought either
    before or after the time for service has expired.  This court’s decision in <i>Brown v. Humble</i> is part of the jurisprudence governing the
    procedure for granting extensions to claims issued in Ontario.  From this decision it is apparent that an issued
    claim that is not served within the time frame provided in the <i>Rules</i> does not become a nullity.  In <i>Brown
    v. Humble</i>, the court adopted the reasoning of the English Court of Appeal
    in <i>Sheldon v. Brown Bayley’s Steel Wks.</i>,
    [1953] 2 All. E.R. 383, 894.  In that
    case, Denning L.J. held at p. 897 that, “if a writ may be renewed after 12
    months have expired that must mean that it is not then a nullity.”  Similarly, Singleton L.J. commented at p.
    896:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not regard it as strictly accurate to describe
    a writ which has not been served within 12 months as a nullity.  It is not as though it had never been
    issued.  It is something that can be
    renewed.  A nullity cannot be renewed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure </i>and this court’s decision in <i>Brown v. Humble </i>does not violate any of the provisions of the Warsaw
    Convention – once the respondents complied with the requirement in article 29
    that a claim be issued within the two-year period, they brought themselves
    within Ontario’s <i>Rules</i>.  Pursuant to those <i>Rules</i> and the jurisprudence governing them, the <i>nunc pro tunc</i> extension to the time for
    service did not amount to the bringing of a new claim; the claim had already
    been “intentée” and the time for service  of the existing claim was extended in
    accordance with Ontario procedure.  Accordingly,
    we see no error in the master’s application of the Ontario <i>Rules</i>, as interpreted by decisions of this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondents are entitled to costs.  With respect to the quantum of costs, we
    agree with the appellant’s submission that a reduction in the amount sought
    should be made to take into account the fact that the motion for fresh evidence
    was unnecessary.  Costs to the
    respondents fixed at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
