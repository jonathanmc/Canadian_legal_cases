  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from a first degree murder
    conviction.  The appellant admitted to
    having unlawfully caused the death of the victim and offered a plea of guilty
    to manslaughter.  The Crown refused to
    accept that plea and presented its case for a verdict of first degree murder.  At the conclusion of the Crown’s case, the
    trial judge dismissed a defence motion for a directed verdict of not guilty of
    first degree murder.  The appellant
    testified in his own defence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts may be briefly stated.  The 78-year-old victim had befriended the
    appellant, a 36-year-old homeless drug addict, and from time to time provided
    the appellant with temporary refuge and money in exchange for consensual sexual
    activities.  The victim was found dead on
    the floor of his apartment, fully clothed, lying face down with his hands
    behind his back.  The cause of death was
    strangulation.  The victim had also
    suffered non-fatal blunt force injuries to his head and various other injuries
    to his torso and limbs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he had gone to the victim’s
    apartment after a sustained cocaine binge and engaged in consensual sexual
    activities with the victim, including bondage in which the appellant had tied
    the victim’s hands behind his back.  Following
    this sexual encounter, they got dressed and, after a period of time, the
    appellant decided to leave the apartment to get more cocaine.  The victim tried to persuade him to stay and
    grabbed the appellant’s arm, provoking the violent attack that resulted in the
    victim’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown based its case for first degree murder upon
    the theory that the appellant had killed the victim while forcibly confining
    him by tying his hands behind his back.  This
    largely rested on evidence of injuries to the victim’s wrists and the position
    of his hands.  There were no restraints
    or ligatures on the victim’s wrists when he was found. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this court, the appellant raises four grounds of
    appeal and asks this court to set aside the conviction for first degree murder
    and substitute a verdict of guilty of second degree murder.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><span class=GramE><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Issue 1.</span></i></span><i><span style='font-weight:normal'> Did the
    trial judge err by dismissing the appellant’s motion for a directed verdict of
    acquittal on first degree murder?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the Crown’s case the appellant
    moved for a directed verdict of acquittal with respect to first degree murder.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in concluding that there was sufficient evidence of forcible confinement
    at the time of death to warrant leaving first degree murder with the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are unable to accept that submission.  The crucial evidence was that of the
    pathologist, Dr. Pollanen, who gave a carefully measured expert opinion as to
    the significance of the injuries on the victim’s wrists in relation to the Crown’s
    theory of forcible confinement.  While at
    one point in his evidence Dr. Pollanen described the evidence of restraint as
    being “highly suspicious”, the trial judge did not err in concluding that on a
    fair reading of his evidence as a whole, the net effect of Dr. Pollanen’s
    evidence was that restraint of the victim’s wrists at a time proximate to death
    was “a reasonable inference”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge recognized the weaknesses in the
    Crown’s case for first degree murder.  No
    restraints were found and Dr. Pollanen could not be more precise than to say
    that the injuries to the wrists suggested binding in the peri-mortem period, in
    other words, at around the time of death.  Based upon his examination of the marks on the
    victim’s wrists, Dr. Pollanen testified that they could have been caused up to
    four hours prior to death.  However, Dr.
    Pollanen’s careful opinion evidence as to what he could and could not say about
    the precise timing of the injuries to the wrists had to be considered in the
    context of the other evidence, in particular, the position of the victim’s hands
    behind his back and the relative absence of defensive injuries to the hands.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her reasons for dismissing the motion the trial judge
    stated and applied the test laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Arcuri</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828.  Her reasons demonstrate that she was alive to
    the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence on this crucial point and that she
    appropriately applied the guiding legal principles laid down in <i>Arcuri</i>.  In our view, she did not err in concluding
    that the Crown’s evidence, when taken as a whole, was reasonably capable of
    supporting the inference that the Crown asked the jury to draw. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p><span class=GramE><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Issue 2.</span></i></span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Did the
    trial judge err in the jury charge by failing to relate the relevant evidence
    to the issue of first degree murder?</span></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground of appeal is related to the first
    ground in that it also turns on the evidence relating to the timing of the
    injuries to the victim’s wrists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed the positions of the Crown and
    the defence in some detail, clearly pointing out the defence position as to the
    weakness in the evidence relating to forcible confinement.  She then proceeded to review the evidence,
    including that of Dr. Pollanen, at some considerable length in relation to the
    issue of the appellant’s capacity to form <span class=GramE>an intent</span> to
    kill, carefully scrutinizing his evidence as to what could and could not be
    inferred from the injuries to the victim's wrists.  However, when it came to dealing with the
    instruction on the legal elements of first degree murder, she briefly
    summarized that evidence and referred to her more extensive discussion of the
    evidence bearing upon first degree murder that had come shortly before. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant complains that the review of the crucial
    evidence at this important point in the charge was truncated and incomplete and
    that the charge was inadequate for that reason.  In particular, the appellant complains that
    the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that Dr. Pollanen could not exclude
    the possibility that the injuries to the wrists could have occurred as much as
    four hours prior to death, a possibility consistent with the appellant’s
    account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are unable to accept this submission.  While another judge might have chosen to structure
    the charge differently, we are satisfied that the jury was properly instructed
    on this central issue and that when read as a whole, the charge left the jury
    with an adequate understanding of the evidence as to the timing of the injuries
    to the wrists and the defence position as to the effect of that evidence as it
    related to forcible confinement. It would have been apparent to the jury that
    the issue of forcible confinement came down to when the victim’s wrists had
    been bound.  Part of the pathological
    evidence established a range and the jury had to look to other aspects of the
    evidence – the position of the hands, the relative absence of defensive wounds,
    and the appellant’s own account of the events – to decide whether the Crown had
    established beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim had been killed while
    being forcibly confined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that trial counsel did not raise any objection
    to this aspect of the jury charge.  While
    not fatal, the absence of an objection by skilled and experienced defence
    counsel does have a bearing upon our assessment of the overall fairness of the
    charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Issue 3.</span></i></span><i><span style='font-weight:normal'> Did the
    trial judge err by failing to give a limiting instruction with respect to the
    post-offence conduct evidence?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied on evidence of post-offence conduct,
    the cleanup of the apartment and the removal of valuable items including
    jewellery, as being relevant to the issue of the appellant’s capacity to form
    intent and of his actual intent to kill.  The trial judge accepted that position and
    left the evidence of post-offence conduct with the jury. No issue is taken with
    that aspect of the charge.  The appellant
    submits, however, that the trial judge should have expressly directed the jury that
    the evidence of post-offence conduct was not relevant to the issue of first degree
    murder, which turned on the issue of forcible confinement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant that the evidence of
    post-offence conduct had no bearing on first degree murder.  It might have been preferable had the trial
    judge charged the jury to that effect.  However,
    we agree with the Crown that the failure to give an instruction to that effect
    did not prejudice the appellant in the circumstances of this case. In our view
    it would have been apparent to the jury that the only basis for first degree
    murder was that the appellant had killed the victim while forcibly confining
    him and equally apparent that the evidence of post-offense conduct had no
    bearing on that issue.</p>
  <h3><span class=GramE><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Issue 4.</span></i></span><i><span style='font-weight:normal'> Did the
    trial judge err with respect to the “decision tree”?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the appellant's concession that he had caused the
    death of the victim, it is common ground before this court that the question
    regarding causation in the decision tree given to the jury was not required.  We agree with the respondent that this
    question was superfluous but not prejudicial.  We fail to see how putting this unnecessary
    question to the jury could have caused any confusion or had any adverse impact
    on the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons the appeal from conviction is
