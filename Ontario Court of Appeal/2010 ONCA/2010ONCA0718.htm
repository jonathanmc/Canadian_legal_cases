    to make restitution in the amount of $141,752 to the victims of his thefts be
    upheld?  For the reasons that follow, I
    would answer, “Yes,” and dismiss this appeal. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was born in Peru on February 28, 1959,
    and immigrated to Canada in 1991.  In
    2000, he opened a paralegal firm with his brother, Manuel.  The firm specialized in assisting victims of
    motor vehicle accidents in reaching personal injury settlements with insurance
    companies.  The appellant’s clients were
    new immigrants to Canada whose first language, like his, was Spanish.  Many were unemployed and on social assistance
    or disability pensions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April of 2001, the appellant began to steal from
    some of his clients.  The appellant
    deposited the settlement cheques from the accidents in his trust account and
    then converted that money to his own use.  The banking records show that he used the funds to buy money orders for
    an unknown purpose.  When questioned by
    the clients as to where the money was, the appellant lied about not having
    reached a settlement or not having received the settlement cheque.  In addition, the appellant was found guilty
    of forging the signature of one client, Ms. Blanca Benitez, on a release
    document that finalized a settlement agreement.  He then used the document to defraud State Farm Insurance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting on complaints, the Financial Services Commission
    suspended the appellant’s insurance licence in December 2004.  By April 2005 the firm had stopped operating
    and was evicted by the landlord.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial, the appellant was found guilty on
    May 27, 2008, of six counts of theft relating to the settlement money of six
    clients, two counts of forgery, and one count of fraud. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In convicting the appellant, the trial judge reviewed
    the specific facts with respect to each complainant.  With regard to Mr. Samuel Cristales, the
    victim from whom the appellant had stolen the most money ($90,000), the trial
    judge stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Samuel Cristales, the last of the six complainants,
    retained the Castro firm in January, 2002.  The firm negotiated a personal injury insurance settlement on his behalf
    in the amount of $125,000.  The fees
    agreement provided that Mr. Cristales would receive $90,000.  Manuel initially denied receiving the
    settlement cheque.  However, when confronted
    by Mr. Cristales who had learned otherwise from the insurer, Manuel admitted
    that the cheque had been received.  Unfortunately, explained Manuel, the firm was in a “difficult”
    situation.  He asked if Mr. Cristales
    would accept $30,000 a month over three months.  Initially agreeable, Mr. Cristales rejected the partial payment scheme
    and insisted that the full $90,000 be paid to him as agreed.  Manuel became angry and said, “We have the
    money … if we want to give you some we will and if we don’t, then we
    won’t.”  When threatened with a law suit,
    Manuel responded, “We have the money in a place where no one can get at it.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cristales received nothing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was sentenced to 23 months’ imprisonment
    plus 2 years’ probation, and ordered to make restitution pursuant to s. 738(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-46.  He has served the custodial
    portion of his sentence.  The appellant
    seeks to have the restitution portion of his sentence set aside or to have the
    amount reduced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manuel Castro, who had also been charged, was
    acquitted.  He had no signing authority
    on the firm’s bank accounts and the trial judge found he was not directly
    involved in the transfer or conversion of funds.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>2.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         The Submissions on
    Sentence and the Sentencing Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown sought a penitentiary term of three to five
    years.  In addition, the Crown sought a
    free-standing restitution order for the victims who were still owed money.  At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge
    and the Crown engaged in a brief discussion about restitution and whether it could
    be ordered when it was highly unlikely that it would be paid.  The Crown informed the trial judge that a
    restitution order survives bankruptcy and can be a free-standing
    obligation.  However, recognizing that
    the appellant had a limited ability to pay, the Crown suggested that it would
    be inappropriate to have the restitution order attached to the appellant’s
    probation order as this would set Mr. Carlos up for breach of probation.  The Crown provided the trial judge with case
    law where restitution was ordered in addition to a sentence of incarceration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence counsel’s primary position on sentence
    was that a conditional sentence of two years less a day, to be served in the
    community, was appropriate.  Defence
    counsel acknowledged, “There hasn’t been much restitution, but my client really
    hasn’t had the ability to repay it having been deprived of his
    livelihood”.  Defence counsel submitted
    that although the appellant prevaricated and deceived his clients, he never
    really denied that he owed them money.  The appellant signed documents with respect to some of the victims
    acknowledging that he owed them money and made small payments to others.  He did not intend to steal the money on a
    permanent basis.  Defence counsel stated
    that the appellant “was just in financial trouble and he took the money where
    it was easiest to take.”  He concluded
    his submissions on restitution as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree with the case law perhaps here denunciation
    and general deterrence are more important than other factors here.  Specific deterrence, in my submission, isn’t
    really that necessary here.  Whether
    there should be an order for restitution, I will leave that in Your Honour’s
    hands.  My client still has very little
    money to pay back, but it may only be fair to the complainants to give them
    that much, but, in my respectful submission, a sentence of actual jail isn’t
    really in this case going to further the ends of justice or the interests of my
    client. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of sentencing the appellant was unemployed
    and collecting monthly disability benefits of $900 a month.  According to his pre-sentence report, he
    hoped to open a business restoring antique furniture and to one day compensate
    his victims.  Defence counsel also filed
    reference letters for the appellant, one of which was from a small business
    owner of an office cleaning business which stated that the appellant “has an
    open job offer anytime.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge considered
    the following aggravating factors:</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Castro abused a position of trust as a
    paralegal to whom his clients granted a Power of Attorney.</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Castro knew the victims were vulnerable and
    dependent on him, and that they needed the settlement money urgently.</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The level of deceit was substantial.</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There had been no restitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also considered the following
    mitigating factors:</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Castro was a first time offender.</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He did not intend to steal the money on a
    permanent basis.  He openly acknowledged
    that he owed clients money, and made partial payments in a number of cases.</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither Ms. Benitez nor State Farm Insurance was
    harmed financially by the appellant’s fraud—the amount paid by State Farm to
    the appellant was the amount that had previously been agreed to by the parties,
    and eventually the appellant paid Ms. Benitez.</p>
  <p class=BULLETLIST><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Castro expressed remorse to various
    individuals in his life, including his minister and physician, for his actions
    and the losses he caused the victims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel had suggested that the appellant stole
    the money in order to support his brother’s drug habit.  However, that explanation was not offered by the
    appellant himself when he testified at trial.  The trial judge decided, “Defence counsel’s
    suggestion, although plausible, will therefore be given no weight as a
    mitigating factor.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the case law on sentencing that counsel
    had provided him, the trial judge concluded that in situations of theft “where
    the amount involved is in the lower end of the large-scale range, <i>i.e.</i> less than $200,000 and there are
    few if any mitigating factors”, the most appropriate sentence is a reformatory
    sentence in the range of 18 to 23 months.  The trial judge felt that in the present case, the sentence for the six
    theft counts, given the aggravating factors, should be about 21 months;
    however, inasmuch as Mr. Castro did not intend to permanently deprive the
    victims of their money, the trial judge decided instead to impose a sentence of
    19 months on the theft charges.  With
    respect to the forgery and fraud charges, he imposed a sentence of four and a
    half months (reduced to four months due to pre-trial custody) to be served
    consecutively, for a total sentence of 23 months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then discussed why a conditional
    sentence was not appropriate.  He wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A conditional sentence for a
    large-scale theft or fraud by a person in a position of trust has only been
    imposed where the circumstances were exceptional—for example, where there was
    no intention to defraud or where the defendant was not motivated by personal
    gain or where there was only a risk of loss and no actual loss. … In this case,
    Mr. Castro fully intended to take and convert his clients’ money, he was
    clearly motivated by personal gain and actual monetary losses were sustained by
    the victims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was of the opinion that a conditional
    sentence would not be consistent with the principles of sentencing.  Specifically, he found that “[a]n effective
    expression of general deterrence and denunciation to the extent required by this
    case would not be achieved by imposing a term of house arrest, particularly for
    an offender who is currently unemployed and living at home on disability
    payments.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to imposing a custodial sentence of 23
    months, the trial judge ordered restitution in the amount of $141,752.  In a footnote to his reasons, the trial judge
    stated, “This is a free-standing restitution order in favour of the five
    clients who lost money: Rodrigues $3,000; I. Moran $16,000; S. Moran $19,000;
    Romero $13,752 and Cristales $90,000.”  The
    trial judge calculated the amount owing to each victim in a manner that was
    most favourable to the appellant.  The
    trial judge concluded his reasons on sentence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr.
    Castro, you have committed some serious crimes and you will now be obliged to
    pay the price.  However, you are still
    only 49 years old.  You have many years
    of productive life ahead of you.  Good
    luck to you.</p>
  <p><b>THE ISSUES ON APPEAL</b></p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that in making the restitution
    order, the trial judge committed three errors: (1) he did not consider
    restitution alongside the sentence of incarceration, and ordered it as a
    “mechanical afterthought”; (2) he did not consider the appellant’s ability to
    pay; and (3) he did not exercise caution and restraint in making the
    restitution order.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 738(1)(a) governs the making of restitution
    orders when money has been taken.  It
    gives the court discretion to order the offender to make restitution by paying
    the victim “an amount not exceeding the replacement value of the property as of

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A restitution order forms part of a sentence.  In accordance with general sentencing
    principles, a restitution order is entitled to deference and an appellate court
    will only interfere with the sentencing judge’s exercise of discretion on the
    basis of error in principle or if the order is excessive or inadequate: see<i> R. v. Devgan</i> (1999),<i> </i>136 C.C.C. (3d) 238 (Ont. C.A.), at

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A restitution order should not be made as a mechanical
    afterthought to a sentence of imprisonment:  <i>R. v. Siemens </i>(1999), 136
    C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Man. C.A.), at para. 10.   Care must be taken not to simply add a
    restitution order to a sentence of imprisonment which, in itself, is a fit
    punishment for the crime, as this can amount to excessive punishment and offend
    the totality principle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point for any discussion of the objectives
    and factors that inform a judge’s exercise of discretion in making a restitution
    order is the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in<i> R. v. Zelensky</i>,<i> </i>[1978] 2
    S.C.R. 940.  While the decision deals
    with predecessor legislation,<a href="#_ftn3"

'>[3]</span></span></span></a> the decision of Laskin C.J. nevertheless serves as a blueprint for the considerations
    to be taken into account in making a restitution order under s. 738(1).  These considerations were summarized by
    Labrosse J.A. in<i> Devgan</i> at para. 26 as
    part of a non-exhaustive list:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Zelensky</i>, Laskin C.J. identified certain
    objectives and factors that relate to the application of s. 725(1).  These considerations have been expanded upon
    in subsequent cases.  Below, I have
    consolidated these objectives and factors, all of which are relevant to the
    issue of what constitutes a proper exercise of discretion for the purpose of s.
    725(1).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An order for compensation should be made with restraint
    and caution;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concept of compensation is essential to the
    sentencing process:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)     it emphasizes the sanction
    imposed upon the offender;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)    it
    makes the accused responsible for making restitution to the victim;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) it
    prevents the accused from profiting from crime; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)   it
    provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery for the victim;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.      A
    sentencing judge should consider:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the purpose of the aggrieved person in invoking s. 725(1);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether civil proceedings have been initiated and are
    being pursued; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the means of the offender.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.      A
    compensation order should not be used as a substitute for civil
    proceedings.  Parliament did not intend
    that compensation orders would displace the civil remedies necessary to ensure
    full compensation to victims.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.      A
    compensation order is not the appropriate mechanism to unravel involved
    commercial transactions;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.      A
    compensation order should not be granted when it would require the criminal
    court to interpret written documents to determine the amount of money sought
    through the order.  The loss should be
    capable of ready calculation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.      A
    compensation order should not be granted if the effect of provincial  legislation would have to be considered in
    order to determine what order should be made;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8.      Any
    serious contest on legal or factual issues should signal a denial of recourse
    to an order;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>9.      Double
    recovery can be prevented by the jurisdiction of the civil courts to require
    proper accounting of all sums recovered; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10.    A
    compensation order may be appropriate where a related civil judgment has been
    rendered unenforceable as a result of bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As support for these factors, Labrosse J.A. cited <i>Zelensky</i> at pp. 960-64; <i>R. v. Fitzgibbon</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1005,
    at pp. 1012-14; <i>London Life Insurance Co.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general, the omission of a judge to give
    consideration to a relevant factor gives rise to reviewable error.  Thus, the omission of a sentencing judge to
    give any consideration to the relevant factor of the offender’s ability to
    repay the amount of money taken is an error.  A restitution order is not intended to undermine the prospects for
    rehabilitation of the offender.  See e.g. <i>R. v. Ali </i>(1997), 98 B.C.A.C. 239; <i>R. v. Biegus</i> (1999),<i> </i>141 C.C.C. (3d) 245 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 15 and 22; and <i>R. c. Ford </i>(2002), 2 C.R. (6th) 348
    (C.Q. crim. &amp; pén.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reviewing courts have, however, consistently held that
    no single factor is itself determinative of whether a compensation order should
    be granted and that the weight to be given to individual considerations will
    depend on the circumstances of each case.  Those circumstances include two considerations I wish to emphasize: the
    nature of the offence and, when money has been taken, what has happened to the
    money. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the nature of the offence is concerned, in
    cases involving breach of trust, the paramount consideration is the claims of
    the victims:<i> Fitzgibbon</i> at pp.
    1014-15.  Ability to pay is not the
    predominant factor.  Indeed, <span
class=verdana>where the circumstances of the offence are particularly
    egregious, such as where a breach of trust is involved, </span>a restitution
    order may be made even where there does not appear to be any likelihood of
    repayment: <i>R. v. Yates </i>(2002),<i> </i>169 C.C.C. (3d) 506 (B.C.C.A.), at
    paras. 12 and 17. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decisions in <i>Ali,

    breach of trust.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  By contrast, <i>Fitzgibbon</i> involved an undischarged bankrupt lawyer who
    acknowledged the amounts he owed.  He was
    ordered to pay compensation to the Law Society of Upper Canada’s Compensation
    Fund and to reimburse a client for the amount by which the client’s losses
    exceeded the maximum allowable claim from the Compensation Fund.  Cory J., writing on behalf of the court,
    stated at pp. 1014-15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The appellant] used his position to defraud the
    very persons who had every reason to trust and rely upon him.  The fraudulent acts of a lawyer directed
    against his own clients warranted the imposition of a compensation order even
    though the lawyer’s means at the time of sentencing were minimal.  <i>The
    claims of the victims of the fraudulent acts should be paramount.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In imposing a sentence where the offender has used his
    or her position to commit a breach of trust, the <i>primary</i> considerations are the protection of the public, general
    deterrence and the repudiation of the conduct of which the offender was found
    guilty.  Relevant factors include the
    length of time over which the conduct took place, whether the offence was a
    sophisticated and well planned scheme, the amount involved, and, most
    importantly, the impact of the offender’s conduct on the victims.  The<i> secondary </i>considerations are specific deterrence, rehabilitation and any mitigating
    circumstances such as a plea of guilty or co-operation with the authorities (in
    tracing the funds): <i> Scherer</i>, per Martin J.A. at para. 34. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In<i> Sherer</i>, some
    of the victims had lost most or all of their life savings as a result of the
    offender’s breach of trust.  While Martin
    J.A. reduced the sentence of imprisonment from nine years to seven years, he
    upheld the compensation order in the amount of $2,173,164.21 to the persons
    aggrieved.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Restitution in that case recognized the
    victims’ needs and at the same time underlined the larger social interest in
    the imposition of a sanction related to the crime.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not a breach of trust has occurred, the
    impact of the crime on the victim is an important factor.  In <i>Biegus,</i> the appellant was one of several co-accused convicted of bank theft.  The ringleader, Hornett, worked for Intercon
    Security and as a result had access to the combinations of ATM machines in
    various Royal Bank branches.  Biegus was
    brought in by Hornett and participated with him in seven thefts.  After Biegus pleaded guilty, he co-operated
    fully with the police and returned $14,000 of the cash.  He received a sentence of two years less a
    day in jail and was ordered to make restitution of the remaining amount stolen in
    the seven thefts with Hornett, namely $638,534.  The sentencing judge recognized that Biegus did not have the ability to
    pay this amount but did not say why this fact was irrelevant in imposing the
    order for restitution.  On appeal, the
    court held that the sentencing judge erred in not addressing this factor and
    also erred by failing to take into account the potentially unfair effect to
    Biegus of the restitution orders already made against two other
    co-accused.  The court did not say that
    Biegus engaged in any breach of trust.  The restitution order was excessive and prevented Biegus’s
    rehabilitation.  The court noted that the
    bank’s insurer had already repaid the bank $453,387.70.  Furthermore, the bank could be in a position
    to recover a portion of its losses from Hornett.  Therefore, the court reduced the amount of
    restitution to $264,000, the amount Biegus acknowledged he received from the
    robbery.  Where the victim is a large
    institution, or is likely to have insurance for the amount of the loss, the
    impact on the victim will obviously be much less than in situations where
    disabled or elderly persons have lost their ability to earn income and to
    replace the money taken.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings me to a discussion of the second
    consideration I wish to emphasize, namely evidence as to what has happened to
    the money that was taken illegally, and how this evidence factors into a
    determination of the ability to pay.<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ability to pay must take into consideration what
    disclosure has been made respecting where the money is or has gone.  Depriving the offender of the fruits of his
    crime is one of the overarching goals of making a restitution order: see
    Working Paper 5 of the Law Reform Commission of Canada, October 1974, cited
    with approval by Laskin C.J. in <i>Zelensky</i> at pp. 592-593.  In cases of theft,
    robbery, fraud, breach of trust or the like, I see no reason why the court
    should accept an offender’s bald assertion that he or she has no ability to
    make restitution because the money “is gone” when no evidence is proffered in
    support of this assertion.  When the
    victims can clearly establish that “the replacement value of the property” under
    s. 738(1)(a) is the amount of money taken, surely it is the offender asserting
    that he or she has no ability to make restitution who is in the best position
    to provide transparency concerning what has happened to that money.  A bald assertion that the money is gone
    should be given no weight.  Similarly,
    when the location of the money illegally obtained by the offender is unknown,
    the sentencing judge is entitled to take that fact into account with respect to
    ability to pay in making a restitution order: see e.g. <i>R. v. Williams</i> (2007),<i> </i><span
class=ssl2>2007 CanLII 13949 (Ont. S.C.),</span> per Hill J. at para. 41. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> To summarize, a
    restitution order is simply part of the determination of an overall fit
    sentence, and general sentencing principles apply.  While consideration of the offender’s ability
    to pay and the impact of a restitution order on an offender’s rehabilitation
    are factors to be considered, the weight to be given to these factors will vary
    depending on the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the
    offender.  When the offence involves a
    breach of trust, a primary consideration is the effect on the victim; rehabilitation
    is a secondary consideration.  Furthermore, consideration of the ability to pay includes the ability to
    make payment from the money taken as a source of restitution. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now apply these principles to this appeal.</p>

    consider restitution alongside other aspects of the appellant’s
    punishment.  I disagree.  The judge’s sentencing decision must be read
    in context and as a whole.  The judge
    determined that the appellant’s case was similar to, but more serious than,
    four cases involving breach of trust where full restitution was ordered in
    addition to imprisonment of between 14 and 18 months: <i>R. v. McEachern </i>(1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 189 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Smith</i> (2004), 191 O.A.C. 1 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Collalti</i>,<i> </i>[2003] O.J. No. 5353 (S.C.J.); and <i>Williams</i>.<a href="#_ftn7"

'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  In the present case, although the trial judge
    did not explicitly say so, it is clear from his sentencing reasons that he
    considered the entirety of the sentence when making the restitution order.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber style='line-height:normal;'><b>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Ability to

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The appellant
    submits that the trial judge erred by not considering his ability to </p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=ParaNO>pay the full amount of the order.  The appellant is currently unemployed and his
    only source of income is a monthly disability payment of $990.  The restitution order in the full amount will
    negatively impact his post-incarceration rehabilitation.  He submits that although this is a case where
    there has been an abuse of trust, in <i>Scherer </i>this court stated, “It may be that in some cases it would be inappropriate
    and undesirable to make a compensation order in an amount that is unrealistic
    to think the accused could ever discharge.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s submission focuses on his present
    ability to pay.  The trial judge’s  comment, at the conclusion of his reasons,
    that the appellant was only 49 years old and had many years of productive life
    ahead of him, is indicative that the trial judge was considering the
    appellant’s future prospects in imposing the restitution order he did.  The trial judge had before him evidence that
    the appellant hoped to open his own business restoring furniture and had a
    standing offer of employment with a cleaning company.  The trial judge imposed a free standing
    restitution order as opposed to making restitution a term of probation, which
    would have required payment within a relatively short time frame. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the trial judge was entitled to note, as
    he did, that little or no restitution had been made.   It is not clear to me whether Carlos Castro
    was present when Manuel Castro made his comment to Mr. Cristales about the
    money being “in a place where no one can get at it”, nor were Carlos and Manuel
    Castro co-venturers.  Thus, for the purposes
    of this appeal, I will assume that the comment is not admissible against the
    appellant.  However, there was no
    evidence proffered as to what the appellant did with the money once he withdrew
    it from his trust account.  The trial
    judge rightly rejected counsel’s bald submission that the money had been used
    to buy drugs for his brother’s cocaine habit.  The lack of evidence as to what happened to the money obtained by the
    appellant’s conduct was a fact open to the trial judge to consider regarding
    ability to pay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore find that the trial judge did not fail to
    take into consideration the appellant’s ability to pay. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral submissions before this court, the appellant
    submitted that the restitution order is a prejudice to him because he cannot
    apply for a pardon for his crimes until he has made restitution to his
    victims.  Without a pardon, it is
    unlikely that the appellant will be able to obtain certain types of
    employment.  Where fraud is involved, a
    restitution order survives bankruptcy.  The
    victims are also free to pursue civil remedies.  The appellant submits that in making a restitution order for the full
    amount owed, trial judge did not exercise restraint and caution.  The restitution order should be reduced. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The comment that a restitution order should be
    made with restraint and caution is sometimes taken out of context as a free-standing
    brake on the making of a compensation order.  The comment by Laskin C.J. in <i>Zelensky</i> regarding restraint and caution was made in the context of a broader statement that
    the purpose of a compensation order should not be to enforce a civil
    obligation, particularly where the amount taken is unclear; rather, the purpose
    of a compensation order is as part of the sentence.  See <i>Zelensky</i> at pp. 961-962.  The fact that a
    restitution order provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of
    recovery for the victim, especially a vulnerable victim, is one of the
    considerations in favour of the making of such an order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the court was advised that some of
    the victims initiated civil proceedings against the appellant, and at least one
    victim, Mr. <span class=verdana>Fausto Romero,</span> has obtained a civil
    judgment that remains unsatisfied.  Thus,
    the trial judge’s purpose in ordering restitution was not to circumvent the
    civil process respecting a disputed amount.  There was no dispute at trial as to the amount the appellant had
    stolen.  The victims tended to understate
    the amounts they were owed.  The trial
    judge determined the amount of restitution based on the victims’ estimates and
    thus the amount ordered already represents a reduction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The civil judgment obtained remains
    unsatisfied.  It appears that the
    appellant’s paralegal firm, Castro and Associates, has gone bankrupt.  The record is silent as to whether the
    appellant has personally declared bankruptcy.  While the appellant points out that an order for the repayment of money
    obtained by fraud survives bankruptcy, there was only one allegation of fraud
    respecting forgery of Ms. Benitez’s signature and no damage flowed from
    that.  The other amounts were stolen.  Inasmuch as a restitution order survives
    bankruptcy, it is possibly the only means of preserving the victims’ claims
    against the appellant. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The imposition of the restitution order was a proper
    exercise of the trial judge’s discretion and he gave effect to the requisite factors.
     The appellant used his position as a
    paralegal to engage in a breach of trust vis-à-vis vulnerable disabled persons.
     He has some future prospects, and the
    disposition of the money obtained by his conduct is unknown.  The restitution order may be the only means of
    preserving the victims’ claims against the appellant.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and

    trial judge’s use of the term “mitigating factor” is curious. Perhaps the trial
    judge meant to say that he would give no weight to the appellant’s bald submission
    that the stolen money had been spent when considering the appellant’s ability
    to pay restitution to his victims. </p>

    “compensation order” made under the former s. 725(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the current s. 738(1) is
    a descendent of s. 725(1) and serves the same purpose of allowing the court to
    include compensation of victims of crime as part of an offender’s
    sentence.  Therefore, the same sentencing
    principles that informed a review of compensation orders, as discussed in <i>Devgan</i>, also inform a review of
    restitution orders under s. 738(1).</p>

'>[3]</span></span></span></a> Formerly,
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> made provision for “restitution
    orders” under s. 655 and “compensation orders” under s. 653.  <i>Zelensky</i> concerned compensation orders under s. 653, which was later re-enacted as s.
    725 and then, in 1995, replaced with the current s. 738.  Thus a “restitution order” under the current
    s. 738 is essentially the former compensation order as discussed in <i>Zelensky</i>, and is similarly aimed at
    restoring the victim to his or her position before the crime.  What used to be s. 655 is now restitution or
    forfeiture under s. 491.1, which provides that property obtained by crime that
    has now been seized by law enforcement authorities or is in the possession of
    the court shall be returned to its lawful owner.</p>

    the offence was setting fire to a building.</p>

'>[5]</span></span></span></a> This
    brings me to another point I wish to make.  In some instances, such as the present, counsel does not contest the
    custodial portion of imprisonment but seeks relief from the restitution
    order.  Based on my reading of <i>Scherer </i>and <i>R. v. Hoyt</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (B.C.C.A.), it seems to me
    that in looking at the question of whether the total sentence is fit, the court
    ought to be in a position to review the total sentence.  It may be that a reviewing court will be more
    sympathetic to reducing the custodial portion of a sentence, because that will
    have no impact on the victims of the offender and may in fact help them because
    the offender will be able to start earning income earlier. Eliminating or
    reducing the amount of restitution an offender has been ordered to pay will
    obviously impact the victims. When leave to appeal only the restitution order
    is sought, the appellant is essentially asking the court to look at the
    totality of the sentence while at the same time refusing to allow the court to
    deal with the totality of the sentence.</p>

'>[6]</span></span></a> </span>The
    sentencing judge should take into consideration more than present income.  The offender’s future ability to earn will be
    at least as important, if not more so, than his or her present means to pay: <i>R. v. Hoyt</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 289
    (B.C.C.A.), at p. 299.  The person who
    has striven to succeed in the past may well do so in the future and be able to
    make payment: <i>R. v. Moscone</i>,<i> </i>[1985] B.C.J. No. 1755 (C.A.).  Consideration of the offender’s ability to
    pay must also take into consideration any assets owned or controlled by the
    offender, such as equity in a home: <i>R. v.
    Rizzetto</i> (2002),<i> </i><span
class=ssl2>210 N.S.R. (2d) 67 (C.A.), </span>at para. 16; <i>Yates</i> at paras. 28-33.</p>

    of trust by an assistant bank manager who stole $87,000; he was sentenced to 18
    months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay $12,000, being the balance of which
    restitution had not yet been made.  Similarly in <i>R. v. Smith</i>, a
    bank employee stole $40,734 with two co-conspirators; the employee was
    sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment and ordered to make restitution of the
    full amount, despite there being co-conspirators.  In <i>R.
    v. Collalti</i>, there was a breach of trust by the accused, who stole about <span
class=verdana>$120,000 from a business for whom she provided bookkeeping
    services; she was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment and ordered to make
    restitution of the full amount.  </span>In <i>R. v. Williams</i>, the accused breached
    her employer’s trust by defrauding her employer; she was sentenced to 18
    months’ imprisonment and ordered to make restitution of $159,000.</p>
