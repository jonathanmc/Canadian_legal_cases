  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This litigation began following the demise – after a
    brief life – of a professional baseball team in Ottawa.  The issues on the appeal concern the
    jurisdiction of an Ontario court to entertain the plaintiffs’ action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball fielded a
    team in the Can-Am League during the 2008 season.  It played its home games in a stadium owned
    by the City of Ottawa.  However, because
    of losses it had incurred during the season, <span class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball gave the League notice that it would be unable to operate beyond
    2008.  It applied under the League’s
    by-laws to withdraw voluntarily because of financial hardship.  The League’s Board of Directors rejected <span
class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball’s application.  Instead, they terminated its membership and
    drew down a $200,000 letter of credit <span class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball
    had been required to post under the by-laws.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball and its
    related companies sued the League and its principals, and the City of Ottawa,
    both in contract and tort.  They seek various
    heads of declaratory relief and damages.  They claim that the League illegally terminated the membership of <span
class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball and had no right to draw down the letter of
    credit.  They allege that “the defendants
    intentionally initiated an interlocking sequence of indebtedness all to the
    risk and jeopardy” of the plaintiffs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The League and its principals (the Can-Am defendants)
    brought a motion under rule 21.01(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to stay or
    dismiss the action on the ground that an Ontario court has no jurisdiction over
    the subject matter of the action.  They
    relied on the choice of forum and arbitration clauses in the League’s by-laws
    and in the agreements signed by the plaintiffs, under which the plaintiffs
    agreed that all disputes with the League would be resolved in the state of
    North Carolina and would be subject to arbitration.  The motion judge, <span class=SpellE>Ratushny</span> J., granted the motion and dismissed the plaintiffs’ action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs make three submissions on their appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An Ontario court should entertain the action because
    the Can-Am defendants <span class=SpellE>attorned</span> to its jurisdiction by
    filing a notice of intent to defend, and then a statement of defence in which
    they defended the plaintiffs’ claim on the merits;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Can-Am defendants cannot rely on the choice of forum
    and arbitration clauses in the agreements signed by the plaintiffs because they
    fundamentally breached these agreements; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario action ought to be allowed to proceed
    against the City of Ottawa and the defendant Wolff, in his personal capacity,
    because neither is a party to any agreement with the League.</p>

    Association of Professional Baseball Ltd. is a North Carolina non-profit corporation,

    LLC is a North Carolina limited liability company owned equally by members of
    the League.  <span class=SpellE>Moushon</span> was the President of the League and <span class=SpellE>Lockard</span> was the Chairman

    Commissioner of the League, and as the co-owner, along with <span class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Sports, of Ottawa Pro Baseball Inc., the entity holding the right to play
    professional baseball in Ottawa.  The

    all terms, provisions and conditions of the League’s articles of incorporation,
    these by-laws, the affiliation agreement between the League and each member,
    and the regulations and rules of baseball”.  Article 2.8 of the by-laws addresses withdrawal from the League, and
    provides for two types of withdrawal – voluntary withdrawal and unsanctioned
    withdrawal.  A member team can withdraw
    voluntarily from the League on a showing of financial hardship to the Board and
    on the approval of three-quarters of the Directors.  On a voluntary withdrawal the member is
    entitled to the return of the letter of credit it has posted.  <span class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball
    applied to withdraw voluntarily after the 2008 season, but the Directors
    rejected its application.  </span></p>

    2.9 of the by-laws deals with involuntary termination or suspension.  An involuntary termination can be either
    automatic or non-automatic.  One of the
    grounds for automatic termination, relied on by the League to terminate <span

    take action reasonably necessary to operate as a going concern.  Under Article 2.11, on an involuntary

    plaintiffs’ action because the Can-Am defendants <span class=SpellE>attorned</span> to its jurisdiction?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have discussed, under the lease agreement, the
    League affiliation agreement and the League’s by-laws the plaintiffs agreed
    that any dispute between <span class=SpellE>Rapidz</span> Baseball and the
    League would be resolved by arbitration (or the League’s internal dispute
    resolution process) and could be litigated only in the courts of North
    Carolina.  In the light of these arbitration
    and choice of forum provisions, and relying on the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    judgment in <i>Z.I. Pompey <span
class=SpellE>Industrie</span> v. <span class=SpellE>ECU&#8209;Line</span> N.V.</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 450, the
    motion judge held that the plaintiffs had to show “strong cause” why they
    should not be bound by these provisions to which they had agreed.  She found that the plaintiffs had failed to
    do so, and therefore dismissed the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs do not argue that their dispute with the
    Can-Am defendants falls outside of the ambit of the choice of forum and
    arbitration clauses to which they agreed.  However, they submit that the motion judge erred in her finding because
    she failed to give effect to the defendants’ <span class=SpellE>attornment</span> to the jurisdiction of the Ontario court.  The plaintiffs argue that the Can-Am defendants and Wolff <span
class=SpellE>attorned</span> to the jurisdiction of the Ontario court by filing
    a statement of defence contesting the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim.  Thus, the plaintiffs say that an Ontario
    court both can and should assume jurisdiction over their action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that an Ontario court has jurisdiction, but, in
    my opinion, the motion judge correctly found that an Ontario court should not
    take jurisdiction.  Both the choice of
    forum and arbitration clauses <span class=GramE>dictate</span> this
    result.  I will deal first with the
    effect of the choice of forum clauses, and then with the effect of the
    arbitration or internal dispute resolution clauses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions about the jurisdiction of an Ontario court
    over a claim typically raise two separate issues.  The first issue is whether an Ontario court
    has or can assume jurisdiction.  <span
class=SpellE>Attornment</span> is relevant to this issue.  An Ontario court has jurisdiction if the
    defendant consents to its jurisdiction or is present in Ontario, and can assume
    jurisdiction on being satisfied of “a real and substantial connection” to
    Ontario:  see <span class=SpellE><i>Muscutt</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Courcelles</span></i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20
    (C.A.), at para. 19.   One of the ways
    that a defendant consents to the jurisdiction of an Ontario court is by <span
class=SpellE>attornment</span> – for example, as in this case, by delivering a
    statement of defence responding to the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim:  see <i>Clinton
    v. Ford</i> (1982), 37 O.R. (2d) 448 (C.A.).  Therefore, as the non-Ontario defendants <span class=SpellE>attorned</span> to the jurisdiction of the Ontario court and the Ontario defendants are present
    in the province, an Ontario court has jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’
    claim.  But that does not end the
    matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When an Ontario court has, or can assume jurisdiction,
    a second issue arises:  whether an
    Ontario court should take jurisdiction.  Decisions on whether a court should take jurisdiction are
    discretionary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case law recognizes two different classes of cases in
    which the court is asked to exercise its discretion.  One arises on a <i>forum non <span class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i> motion; the other
    where the parties have agreed to a forum to resolve their disputes.  Each class of case has its own onus, test and
    rationale.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the more usual <i>forum
    non <span class=SpellE>conveniens</span></i> motion, a court must determine
    whether there is another more convenient forum to try the claim.  The defendant has the onus of showing a more convenient
    forum.  The test invites the application
    of a now well-recognized list of considerations, which assess the connections
    to the two competing forums.  And the
    court’s discretion is guided by the twin rationales of efficiency and fairness:  see, for example, <i>Young v. Tyco International of Canada Ltd.</i> (2008), 92 O.R. (3d) 161
    (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the other class of case, of which the present appeal
    is an example, the parties have agreed to a forum to resolve their
    disputes.  In this class of case, the
    onus is reversed.  The plaintiff must
    show why Ontario should displace the forum chosen by the parties.  The test is “strong cause” – the plaintiff
    must show strong cause why the choice of forum clause should not prevail.  And in exercising its discretion, the court
    is guided by the rationale that ordinarily parties should be held to the
    bargain they have made. In the present context, if a team wants to play in a league,
    it must adhere to the league’s rules:  see <i>Pompey</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was therefore correct in analyzing the
    motion before her under the strong cause test.  And she was also correct in finding that the plaintiffs had not shown
    strong cause to displace the choice of forum clause agreed to by the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is strong cause?   In <i>Expedition Helicopters Inc. v.
    Honeywell Inc.</i> (2010), 100 O.R. (3d) 241 (C.A.) at para. 24, my colleague,
    Juriansz J.A., set out a useful list of factors that may amount to strong
    cause:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A forum selection clause in a commercial contract
    should be given effect.  The factors that
    may justify departure from that general principle are few.  The few factors that might be considered
    include the plaintiff was induced to agree to the clause by fraud or improper
    inducement or the contract is otherwise unenforceable, the court in the selected
    forum does not accept jurisdiction or otherwise is unable to deal with the
    claim, the claim or the circumstances that have arisen are outside of what was
    reasonably contemplated by the parties when they agreed to the clause, the
    plaintiff can no longer expect a fair trial in the selected forum due to
    subsequent events that could not have been reasonably anticipated, or enforcing
    the clause in the particular case would frustrate some clear public
    policy.  Apart from circumstances such as
    these, a forum selection clause in a commercial contract should be enforced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To this list, I would add a case in which the defendant
    has inordinately delayed in bringing its jurisdiction motion.  An example of this kind of case is <i>Mobile Mini Inc. v. Centreline Equipment Rentals
    Ltd.</i> (2004), 190 O.A.C. 149 (C.A.).  In that case, the parties had agreed to litigate disputes in
    Arizona.  However, the plaintiff sued in
    Ontario.  The defendant waited over three
    years and until the case was set to be scheduled for trial before moving to
    challenge the jurisdiction of the Ontario court.  In the meantime, it had taken several steps
    to defend the Ontario action, including delivering a defence and counter-claim
    and participating in production and discovery.  The court held that the delay and the defendant’s conduct justified
    refusing to enforce the choice of forum clause.  To the same effect, see <i>Sault
    College of Applied Arts and Technology v. <span class=SpellE>Agresso</span> Corp</i>., 2007 ONCA 525.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In seeking to maintain its action in Ontario, the
    plaintiffs do not rely on any of the factors cited by Juriansz J.A. other than
    perhaps their claim of fundamental breach of contract, which I will address
    separately.  Nor do they allege that the
    defendants delayed in bringing their motion.  The defendants, indeed, moved reasonably promptly after delivering their
    defence.  Their notice of motion was
    served in August <span class=GramE>2009,</span> eight months after the
    plaintiffs started their action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole ground the plaintiffs rely on to show strong
    cause is the defendants’ <span class=SpellE>attornment</span> to the
    jurisdiction of the Ontario court.  <span
class=SpellE>Attornment</span>, however, is relevant only to the question
    whether an Ontario court has jurisdiction.  It has little or no relevance to the question whether an Ontario court
    should exercise that jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Motions challenging the jurisdiction of an Ontario
    court may be brought under s. 106 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, rule 17.06 and rule 21.01(3)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  The Can-Am defendants brought their motion under rule 21.01(3<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a).  A motion under
    that rule, unlike a motion under rule 17.06, may be brought after the delivery
    of a notice of intent to defend and a statement of defence.  Nothing in rule 21.01(3<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    suggests that a defendant is precluded from contesting jurisdiction because its
    statement of defence responds to the merits of a plaintiff’s claim.  The defendant is required only to bring its
    motion “quickly after the commencement of the suit”:  see <i>Pompey </i>at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 21 and 35.  The Can-Am defendants met that
    requirement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the plaintiffs agreed not only to a choice of
    forum provision, but as well to arbitration or internal dispute resolution
    provisions.  This court has stated more
    than once that when the parties agree to arbitration, the court shall favour
    giving effect to their agreement and preclude them from litigating in the
    courts:  see, for example, <span
class=SpellE><i>Mantini</i></span><i> v. Smith Lyons LLP</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d)
    505 (C.A.); <span class=SpellE><i>Dancap</i></span><i> Productions Inc. v. Key Brand Entertainment
    Inc.</i> (2009), 246 O.A.C. 226 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And where, as in the present case, the parties have
    agreed to both choice of forum and arbitration (or internal dispute resolution)
    provisions, the court has an even firmer basis to preclude the plaintiffs from
    suing in Ontario:  see <span
class=SpellE><i>GreCon</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Dimter</span> Inc. v.
    J.R. Normand Inc.</i>, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 401 at para. 22.  The motion judge therefore made no error in
    concluding that an Ontario court should not entertain the plaintiffs’
    action.  I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second issue:  Can the Can-Am defendants rely on the choice
    of forum and arbitration clauses when the plaintiffs allege that they
    fundamentally breached their agreements?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs contend that the motion judge should not
    have given effect to the choice of forum and arbitration provisions found in
    the lease agreement and the League affiliation agreement, and stipulated in the
    by-laws, because the Can-Am defendants fundamentally breached those
    agreements.  The motion judge dealt with
    and rejected this contention at para. 31 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Neither do I understand why the issue of
    fundamental breach raised by the plaintiffs should not be dealt with under the
    law and by the forum chosen by the parties to the Lease Agreement, the League
    Affiliation Agreement and as set out in the Bylaws.  As stated in <i>Pompey</i>, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 30 and 31:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>[A] court, in the context of an application for
    a stay to uphold a forum selection clause in a bill of lading, must not delve
    into whether one party has deviated from, or fundamentally breached an
    otherwise validly formed contract.  Such
    inquiries would render forum selection clauses illusory since most disputes
    will involve allegations which, if proved, will make the agreement terminable
    or voidable by the aggrieved party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with her reasons and have nothing to add to
    them.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third issue:  Should the Ontario action be allowed to
    proceed against the City of Ottawa and Wolff in his personal capacity, because
    neither is a party to any agreement with the League? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed the plaintiffs’ action in
    its entirety, which means that she dismissed the action not only against the
    Can-am defendants but also against the City of Ottawa and Wolff.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the City of Ottawa is not a party to any
    agreement with the League.  Nor did it
    bring a motion contesting the jurisdiction of the Ontario court.  Wolff is sued not only as a Director and
    Commissioner of the League, but also personally as a shareholder in OPBI and in
    connection with his shareholder loan and covenant to pay stadium rent.  In his personal capacity he is not a party to
    any agreement with the League.  He too
    did not bring a motion challenging the jurisdiction of the Ontario court.  The plaintiffs, therefore, submit that
    neither the City of Ottawa nor Wolff personally can rely on the choice of forum
    and arbitration clauses, and must instead submit to the jurisdiction of the
    Ontario court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs’ submission might have some validity but
    for the way they have pleaded their claim.  The plaintiffs have alleged that all of the defendants, including the
    City and Wolff personally, are necessary parties to the same action.  They have alleged that their claims for
    relief arise out of the same transactions and occurrences, and raise common
    questions of fact and law.  And they have
    alleged that the <span class=SpellE>joinder</span> of all claims will promote
    the convenient administration of justice.  Moreover, their civil conspiracy claim alleges an agreement among all
    defendants to cause the plaintiffs damage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of these allegations the plaintiffs cannot
    maintain that they ought to be allowed to proceed separately in Ontario against
    the City of Ottawa and Wolff personally.  Their claims against the City and Wolff personally are so intertwined
    with the claims against the Can-Am defendants that they must all be dealt with
    together.  Moreover, the claims against
    the City and Wolff all relate to and arise out of the plaintiffs’ dealings with
    the League.  The choice of forum clause
    agreed to by the plaintiffs must therefore govern where their claims should be heard.  Thus, even though neither the City nor Wolff
    personally is a party to an agreement containing a choice of forum clause, on
    the present state of the pleadings, the claims against them should be dealt
    with not in Ontario but in North Carolina:  see <i>Crown Resources Corp. S.A. v.
    National Iranian Oil Co. </i>(2006), 273 D.L.R. (4th) 65 (Ont. C.A.) at para.
    34.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I think it would be possible for the
    plaintiffs to assert their claims against Wolff personally in Ontario.  Those claims are quite severable from the
    claims against the Can-Am defendants, the City and Wolff in his capacity as
    Director and Commissioner of the League.  Wolff has already sued the plaintiffs in Ontario on his guarantee and
    indemnity.  The plaintiffs could assert
    their claims against him personally by counter-claiming in that action.  Or, they could redraft their statement of
    claim to take out their allegations against Wolff personally, and incorporate
    them in a new statement of claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the plaintiffs could maintain an action
    against the City in Ontario by redrafting their claim to focus on their
    principal allegation:  that the City
    reneged on a commitment for a long term lease of the stadium.  However, on the plaintiffs’ current pleading,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
