  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I. Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction for the first
    degree murder of Jacqueline McLean. Ms. McLean was 37 years old when she was
    found dead after an evening of partying with a group of friends and
    acquaintances. The group, which included the appellant, consumed substantial
    quantities of alcohol and crack cocaine during the evening. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. McLean’s body was discovered in a vacant apartment
    in the former Sandbar Hotel in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton
    at about 2:30 a.m. on August 20, 2001. She had been bludgeoned to death by approximately
    six blunt force blows to the head, any one of which would have incapacitated
    her. Her body, naked from the waist down, was found at the top of a set of
    stairs that led to a loft within the vacant unit. Her top and bra were pushed
    up, exposing her breasts. Her running shoes, jeans and underwear were beside
    her. The underwear had been torn into two pieces. Subsequent DNA analysis
    revealed that the appellant’s semen was located in her vagina, on her body, and
    on the outside of the larger of the two portions of her underwear. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the Crown submitted that the appellant killed
    the deceased during the course of a sexual assault and was therefore guilty of
    first degree murder. The Crown was permitted by the trial judge to introduce a videotaped
    statement that the appellant gave to the police following his arrest in which
    he told the police that he had consensual intercourse with Ms. McLean on the
    night in question, but that afterwards, they got dressed and returned to a
    party in another apartment in the same building.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To support its theory that the appellant killed Ms.
    McLean in the course of a sexual assault, the Crown relied on the semen
    evidence, as well as on blood spatter evidence indicating that the deceased was
    wearing her underwear and jeans when she sustained the blunt force injuries and
    that the underwear had been intact and flat when blood droplets were deposited.
    In addition, the Crown relied on forensic evidence that no semen was found on
    the crotch area of the deceased’s underwear or on her jeans. Based on expert
    opinion evidence that semen normally leaks out of the vagina if a woman stands
    up following intercourse, the Crown submitted that the absence of semen in
    these locations demonstrated that the deceased did not stand up after
    intercourse. The Crown’s position was that the only possible explanation for
    the physical evidence found at the scene was that the deceased was wearing her
    underwear when the appellant inflicted the various blows to the head.  The Crown argued that it was only after the
    final blow that the appellant removed the underwear, tearing them in two in the
    process. He then had intercourse with the victim and wiped his semen on the
    larger torn fragment of her underwear. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his closing address, the trial Crown alleged that
    the appellant fabricated his statement to the police and relied on such
    fabrications, as well as statements the appellant made to his girlfriend, as
    evidence of post-offence consciousness of guilt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify at trial. However, in the
    videotaped statement that he gave to the police, he denied killing or sexually
    assaulting Ms. McLean. In his statement, he said that Ms. McLean was a
    prostitute and, over the course of the evening in question, he and another
    party-goer, Barry Lane, enlisted her services at a bar to buy crack cocaine for
    them. After partying at the bar, they went to an apartment at the former
    Sandbar Hotel to smoke crack.  At one
    point, the appellant and Ms. McLean went to a vacant apartment unit upstairs at
    the Sandbar where they smoked crack and had consensual sexual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant claimed that, at Ms. McLean’s request, he
    withdrew during intercourse and ejaculated into her underwear, which had been
    torn off or otherwise removed in the heat of passion. Following this brief
    liaison, the appellant and Ms.&nbsp;McLean returned to the party at the
    downstairs apartment. Later, the appellant left the party to meet his
    girlfriend, who proceeded to break up with him. After that, he went to a detox
    centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Initially in his statement to the police, the appellant
    said that Ms. McLean left her underwear behind in the vacant apartment and just
    wore her pants.  However, later in his
    statement, he acknowledged that he did not see her get dressed after they had
    intercourse – giving rise to a potential inference that she had put her
    underwear back on. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to his statement to the police, the
    appellant relied on the expert evidence of a gynaecologist to support his
    account of consensual intercourse. The gynaecologist’s evidence addressed the
    significance of the absence of injuries to the deceased arising from
    intercourse, as well as the possibility that semen leakage may not occur
    following intercourse, depending on the amount of semen deposited. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the defence submitted that Barry Lane could
    have been the killer. In support of this theory, defence counsel at trial
    pointed to evidence of motive (another witness testified about the deceased’s
    habit of hiding crack in her vagina and defence counsel suggested that Lane, a
    regular crack user, may have killed the deceased and disrobed her to search for
    drugs); opportunity; and apparent falsehoods in Lane’s trial testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal,
    set aside the verdict and order a new trial.  Before explaining this result, we will describe the evidence adduced at
    trial in some detail to provide the necessary factual backdrop to the central
    issues in this case, namely: i) did the trial judge err in failing to properly
    describe the position of the defence and the evidence capable of supporting it;
    and ii) did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury concerning
    post-offence conduct?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II. Background</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>a) The Events of August 19-20, 2001</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            i)
    Events prior to the party at the former Sandbar Hotel</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 19, 2001, the appellant was staying at a
    youth drop-in centre and hostel in Hamilton known as the Wesley Centre with his
    girlfriend, Crystal McLean (no relation to the deceased), and his acquaintance,
    Barry Lane. In the early afternoon, the appellant and Lane went shopping with a
    third man, Ken Makhan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three men returned to the Wesley Centre with
    cigarettes, alcohol and new clothes. The appellant was wearing a new, dark gray
    Adidas shirt and new black Champion tear-away pants. Lane was wearing a new
    white t-shirt with shoulder epaulets and new dark pants. All three men spent
    time selling cigarettes to people on the street and at the Centre to make money
    to buy crack. Accompanied by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Crystal,
    they later went to the apartment of a person known as “Newf”. When the men
    began to smoke crack,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Crystal
    became upset and returned to the Centre. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Lane, and Makhan eventually left Newf’s
    apartment and went downtown, where they continued to sell cigarettes to get
    money to buy crack. That evening, the three men spent time at Big Lisa’s, a
    downtown bar with a reputation for crack trafficking. While at the bar, both
    the appellant and Lane spoke to a server named Sheila Banach who worked at Big
    Lisa’s. According to her, the men already looked “strung out”, and both wanted
    to buy more crack. She also saw them speaking to the deceased and Virginia
    Barberiz, both of whom worked as prostitutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banach first saw the deceased with the appellant and Lane
    between 7:30 and 8&nbsp;p.m. On separate occasions, the deceased and Barberiz
    assisted the appellant, Lane, and Makhan to obtain crack, either from within
    the bar itself or at the next door convenience store where a crack dealer
    operated. After helping him once, Barberiz refused to help Lane anymore because
    of his behaviour towards her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Banach, the deceased had two separate
    arguments in Big Lisa's that evening. The first was with the appellant, who
    told the deceased that he had better get the crack for which he had paid. The
    second argument was between the deceased and Lane. Although she could not tell
    what the argument was about, Banach saw Lane yelling at the deceased. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Banach, the deceased obtained crack for
    Lane and the appellant, but less than expected (apparently because of a debt
    she owed to the seller). Barberiz testified that Lane yelled at the deceased,
    “why did you do that to me”, and said that he had been “ripped [off] by a
    nigger already.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Barberiz, the deceased and the three men
    left the bar together, walking in the direction of the Sandbar Hotel. Barberiz
    left separately, and eventually returned to the Sandbar, where she lived. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            ii)
    The former Sandbar Hotel</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By all accounts, the former Sandbar Hotel in Hamilton
    was a crack house with apartments on the second and third floors. The
    apartments relevant to this appeal are as follows:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unit 3 on the third floor:  Barberiz rented this unit</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unit 4 on the third floor:  Banach had arranged to rent this unit, but
    had not yet moved in. Banach testified that “the girls” sometimes used the unit
    to turn tricks. On August 19, 2001, she told the deceased that she could use
    it. The deceased's body was found in this unit</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unit 7 on the third floor:  Michael Cameron, a friend of Banach, rented
    this unit</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unit 8 on the second floor:  Gordon “Butch” Stadnik rented this unit and
    he hosted the August 19, 2001 party in this unit</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                  iii) The party in Stadnik’s
    apartment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the late evening of August 19, 2001, the appellant,
    Lane, Makhan, Barberiz and the deceased were all reportedly in Stadnik's
    apartment smoking crack.  However, the witnesses
    to the events in the apartment were all using crack, and they all had different
    recollections about who was at the apartment, how they got there, how long they
    stayed, who left, when they left, and who returned. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Stadnik, Barberiz came to his apartment at
    approximately 10 or 11&nbsp;p.m. with her boyfriend and two other men, whom she
    introduced as “Carl” (the appellant) and “Barry” (Lane). Barberiz then went and
    got some crack for the group. Afterwards, the appellant and Lane went to get
    more crack, and later returned to his apartment with some other people,
    including the deceased.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Barberiz denied having brought the appellant and Lane
    to Stadnik's apartment. She testified that she was in and out of Big Lisa’s and
    in and out of her apartment throughout the evening. She claimed that, on one
    occasion, when she was returning to the Sandbar, she stopped in at Stadnik's
    apartment where she saw the appellant, Lane, Makhan, the deceased, and Stadnik.
    The appellant and the deceased were laughing, “sitting beside each other all
    happy.” Barberiz did not stay at Stadnik's apartment, but returned to her own
    apartment where she and her boyfriend smoked crack.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lane testified that he and the appellant encountered
    Barberiz and Stadnik on the street. The appellant took him to Stadnik's
    apartment while Barberiz went down the street to get crack. Contrary to the
    evidence of the other witnesses, Lane claimed the deceased was not present at
    Stadnik's apartment. Moreover, apart from acknowledging that she might have
    served him a drink, Lane also denied any contact with the deceased at Big
    Lisa’s.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            <span class=GramE>iv) The</span> appellant's description of his sexual encounter with the     deceased</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 16, 2002, the appellant was arrested and
    charged with the murder of Ms. McLean. In a videotaped statement to the police
    given on that date, the appellant said that he and the deceased hit it off at
    Stadnik’s apartment and went upstairs to the vacant apartment for “a bit of
    fun.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, he and the deceased each
    smoked a “couple stones” of his crack and then had sex, which he paid for by
    sharing his crack. The deceased fellated him to get him erect. They then
    removed their lower clothing and had sex standing up, with the deceased bent
    over the railing of the loft and the appellant entering her from behind. The
    appellant claimed that in order to enter the deceased, he moved her underwear
    to the side and he said, “[i]n the heat of it ... her panties end up coming off,
    like there was one tear at the side and we, you know, heated up, kind of tore
    ‘em off.”  The appellant said that the
    deceased asked him not to ejaculate inside her, so he withdrew and ejaculated
    into her underwear. He later said he could not tell if any went in her, but “it
    wasn’t supposed to.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Initially, the appellant said that when the deceased
    got dressed, she left her underwear behind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant<span
class=GramE>:       ...</span>She got
    dressed, she wasn't even wearing them [her underwear] when she got dressed and
    then we went downstairs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          Okay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       She just wore pants. A lot of the girls
    just wear pants.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          So she pulls her, her panties off and
    throws them aside.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          Pulls
    up her jeans.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Yeah and I got dressed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in response to further questions, the
    appellant indicated that he did not watch the deceased get dressed and he only
    assumed that she left her underwear behind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          When, when she left and came back
    downstairs, <span class=GramE>her,</span> she pulled her jeans up, you said.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Yeah.   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          And
    her uhm, underwear <span class=GramE>were</span> where?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Well, we left them in the room <span
class=GramE>cause</span> they were like ripped off of her from the side, you
    know what I mean.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          Right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       So, she just left them there. Ah, ha, she
    left them I assume, unless she put them in her pocket.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          Did, <span class=GramE>did</span> you see...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       She
    might have had them...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer<span class=GramE>:          ...</span> them on the floor up there?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant<span
class=GramE>:       ...</span> no, she
    might have had them in her pocket. I don't know. She could have had them in her
    pocket, but I can't see why after they were tore. Like I'm not, I didn't pay
    attention to these little details and things, you know what I mean.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          Okay. Uhm, you said that uh, you tore
    Jackie's underwear or she did?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Uh, I did and she tore them the rest of
    the way. That's it. It's kind of like in the heat of the moment, I was, <span
class=GramE>you</span> know what I mean, still in her.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       You know, oh fuck, it was good, but I
    remember, quick, but you know what I mean, it was like.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          So are they are in one piece. Is there
    more than one piece when you leave?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       One
    piece I think. I don't know.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Officer:          And
    you don't know if she’s...?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Like she, I know I tore ‘em, she tore
    them the rest of the way off of her, I know that. I'm not even sure if they all
    came off her or she slid down her leg and took them off. I don't know. I didn't
    watch her get dressed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, he and the deceased were
    away from Stadnik’s apartment for only 5 to 10 minutes. After they returned to
    Stadnik’s apartment, Barberiz left to pick up more crack and everyone went
    outside. The appellant and the deceased sat on the side of the street with her
    on his knee. After Barberiz returned with some crack, they went back to
    Stadnik's apartment to smoke it. Half an hour later, the appellant left to meet
    his girlfriend at the Wesley Centre.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        v) Other descriptions of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Stadnik, when Barberiz left his apartment
    for the last time, the appellant said he was going home and the deceased said
    that she was going “to make some money”. On Stadnik's evidence, the appellant
    and the deceased left essentially at the same time, leaving Stadnik in his
    apartment with only Lane.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banach testified that she and her friend Michael
    Cameron left Big Lisa’s to go to the Sandbar at 11:50 p.m. She believed that
    the appellant and Lane were both still at the bar at that time. While on the
    way, a few doors from Big Lisa's, she saw the deceased coming from the
    direction of the Sandbar. Banach went into her apartment to change and then
    went to Cameron's apartment. She was in bed in Cameron's apartment by 12:05
    a.m.  She knew the time because she
    recalled looking at a VCR or a clock as she went to bed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tamara Burbank, a Big Lisa's regular, said she recalled
    seeing the deceased in Big Lisa's when she left the bar between 12:30 and 1:00
    a.m.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        <span class=GramE>vi) Lane</span>'s
    actions after the party</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Stadnik, in order to get Lane out of his
    apartment after the others had left, he told Lane he was going out. Lane went
    upstairs and knocked on Barberiz’s door looking for crack. When Barberiz did
    not open the door, Lane came back to Stadnik's apartment and Stadnik told him
    to “get lost”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stadnik testified that 20 minutes to an hour after Lane
    left his apartment, Lane returned to the Sandbar on a bicycle. The shirt Lane
    had been wearing earlier was slung over his shoulder. Lane wanted to exchange
    the bike for crack and asked Stadnik where Barberiz was. The bike had in fact
    been stolen and, at Lane's sentencing for possession of stolen property, his
    lawyer submitted that Lane stole the bicycle in the dramatic aftermath of
    seeing a dead body. However, at the appellant's trial, Lane claimed that he saw
    the body only after he returned on the bike.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lane testified that he planned to return to the Wesley
    Centre after the appellant left because he had no money, alcohol or crack. He
    met Barberiz when he went downstairs.  She gave him some crack, rubbed up against him, took him back to
    Stadnik's apartment and told him to wait there while she got more crack. He
    said he was alone in Stadnik's apartment for at least an hour, with Barberiz
    making repeated visits to give him crack and to encourage him to stay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like Stadnik, Barberiz contradicted Lane’s story. She
    testified that she was in and out of her apartment, turning tricks and getting
    crack. Once, on her way out, she noticed Lane “lurking” in the third floor
    hallway, near unit 4. He was wearing a white T-shirt and black track pants. She
    did not speak to him. She went out, turned a trick, got some crack and returned
    home. As she went up the stairs, she saw Stadnik and Lane standing at Stadnik's
    apartment door. They asked her to come in and talk, but she refused. Later, she
    went out again and once more saw Lane lurking in the hallway, this time wearing
    track pants but no shirt. After he knocked on her door several times and
    referred to a dead body, she called the police, telling them “some strange
    weirdo” was trying to come into her apartment.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        vii) The discovery of the body</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At approximately 2:30 a.m. on August 20, 2001, Jeorge
    Tselepakis, a cook at Big Lisa’s, went to the Sandbar to pick up Banach so that
    she and her boyfriend could stay at his house. He opened the door of unit 4 and
    saw blood. After walking into the apartment and halfway up the stairs to the
    loft, he saw a woman's body and assumed it was Banach. He ran out of the
    apartment and knocked on Barberiz's door shouting, “somebody killed Sheila.”
    Suddenly, Lane appeared behind him, wearing pants but no shirt, and asked
    Tselepakis what he wanted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tselepakis told Lane there was a body in unit 4 in the
    loft. Lane went into the apartment and upstairs to the loft. He lifted the body
    and shook it even though Tselepakis told him not to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A police dispatcher confirmed receiving a call from
    Barberiz at approximately 2:35 a.m. about a suspicious person knocking at her
    door. Between 2:40 and 2:49 a.m., a group, including Lane, flagged down two
    police officers and alerted them to the discovery of the body. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        viii) The appellant's whereabouts
    after leaving the Sandbar</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his statement to the police, the appellant said that
    after he left the Sandbar, he walked to the Wesley Centre to look for Crystal.
    He said that he could not find her, and walked in and out of the building and
    around outside looking for her for about 20 minutes. He found her on the street
    sitting on a curb and they talked for “over an hour”. Crystal broke up with
    him, and, after wandering the streets for a while, he went to the Men’s Detox
    Centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Surveillance tapes at the Wesley Centre, which were
    introduced in evidence by the Crown, showed the appellant’s meeting Crystal
    there at 12:42 a.m. Contrary to the appellant’s statement to police, the tapes
    did not show him entering the building to look for her. The tapes showed the
    couple parting company at 1:32 a.m. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 3:19 a.m., shortly after the appellant arrived at
    the Detox Centre, someone at that facility called a taxi to take the appellant
    to Holmes House, a rehabilitation facility in Simcoe. He arrived there at 5
    a.m. and was observed to be in the early stages of crack-cocaine withdrawal,
    but was lucid and coherent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Wesley Centre is .9 kilometres from the Sandbar. A
    private investigator walked the route and found it took him 8 minutes and 20
    seconds to get from the Wesley Centre to the Sandbar and 21 minutes and 53
    seconds to walk from the Wesley Centre to the Men's Detox Centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystal McLean testified at the trial about her
    interaction with the appellant on the evening in question and about a
    conversation she had within him several months later at the behest of the
    police. She explained that earlier in the afternoon of August 19, 2001, she and
    the appellant as well as Lane and Makhan were at the Wesley Centre. The three
    men went shopping and returned with new clothes, shoes, liquor and cigarettes.
    She left when they went into a bathroom where she believed they were smoking
    crack. She was fed up with the appellant’s drug use.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later that evening, she believed at around 2 a.m., the
    appellant returned to the Wesley Centre. They talked for about an hour. His
    clothes were not dirty, but looked worn for a day. In Crystal’s opinion, he
    smelled “like a whore”. He told her that he had done something bad, that he
    didn’t want to explain it to her and that he wanted to talk about their leaving
    together for the west. However, she broke up with him and he left.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystal went on to testify that in March 2002, she
    visited the appellant in Midland for about one half hour, telling him that the
    police had been coming to her home and asking her about that night. She asked
    him what she should tell them. At the request of Crown counsel, she read parts
    of their conversation from a transcript. In cross-examination, she read other
    parts. At one point, the appellant told her to tell the police nothing, and at
    other points he told her to tell them everything that happened. He also said at
    one point that they were together for over an hour and she corrected him and
    said it was for 45 minutes.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>b) The Forensic Evidence</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        i) The cause of death</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Chitra Rao performed the autopsy on the deceased's
    body and determined that she had suffered approximately six blunt force blows
    to the head. The blows were each substantial enough to cause multiple skull
    fractures, and together, they made death inevitable. Any one of the blows would
    have disabled the deceased. Bruises and abrasions on the body were consistent
    with dragging. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        ii) The police and Dr. Rao examine
    unit 4</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Along with two detectives, Dr. Rao observed the body at
    the scene at around 8:20 a.m. on August 20, 2001. The deceased's body was
    clothed in only a shirt and bra, which had been pushed up around her neck, and
    a pair of white socks. The deceased's jeans, running shoes, and underwear were
    beside her. The underwear had been torn in two and an additional tear ran from
    the waistband to one of the leg holes. The officers believed that a steel bar
    against the wall in the loft was the probable murder weapon.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        iii) DNA analysis of the blood
    stains on the deceased's underwear</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four significant bloodstains were found on the
    deceased's underwear. Two of the bloodstains matched her DNA profile: a large
    stain on the back of the underwear that corresponded to a similar bloodstain on
    the rear of her jeans, and a smaller blood stain on a portion of the crotch
    panel of the underwear.  A third, tiny
    bloodstain was found near the front right hip of the underwear. Analysis showed
    that it contained a mixture of DNA profiles from three persons, at least one of
    whom was male. Neither the deceased nor the appellant could be excluded as
    contributors to this stain. The genetic material from the third person was too
    small for comparative analysis. A fourth bloodstain was found near the
    waistband of the underwear. The genetic material in it was also too small for
    comparative analysis.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        <span class=GramE>iv) The</span> blood spatter evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Constable Craig Moore was qualified to give
    blood spatter evidence. He drew the following conclusions from his examination
    of the blood spatter, smears and pools found in unit 4:</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the deceased was hit at least once near the
    apartment door;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she was probably carried from the door to the
    middle of the living room floor, where pooled blood was found on the carpet;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she was dragged by her arms or shoulders,
    wearing her jeans and underwear (which were both saturated with blood on the
    rear) to the inner edge of the staircase leading up to the loft, as evidenced
    by two smaller pools of blood at the base of the loft stairs;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she was dragged feet first up the stairs, which
    left transfer marks from her head on each step of the stairs;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she was repositioned in the loft and, given the
    pattern of a pool of blood, it was quite possible that her head had been moved;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she was hit at least once in the loft while
    already bleeding and lying on the floor; and</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>she</span> was struck at least
    once while still wearing her underwear, but after it had been exposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Typical of wounds to the head, the deceased bled
    profusely. The first blow to the head would not have caused blood spatter, but
    subsequent blows to the head would have.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Detective Constable Moore's opinion, the blood spatter
    pattern on the deceased's underwear showed that her jeans were down but her
    underwear was still on and intact when at least one of the blows was struck.
    The pattern of blood droplets found on the front of the underwear showed that it
    had been intact and flat (as when worn) when the droplets were deposited.
    Detective Constable Moore also noted that there was a spatter pattern from the
    mid-thigh to the knee on the right leg of the deceased's jeans that did not
    appear on the left leg of the jeans. One possible explanation for this
    difference was that the assailant had straddled the deceased's left leg before
    striking the final blow or blows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Constable Moore also made the following observations,
    which suggested that the assailant may well have got blood on himself or his
    clothing:  there was a transfer stain on
    the wall at the bottom of the stairs that was likely from the assailant; there
    were three similar transfer stains on the wall on the way up the stairs that
    were likely from the assailant; and there were transfer stains on the
    deceased's socks, which may have been caused by the assailant dragging her up
    the stairs by her ankles. As well, there was a large transfer stain on the wall
    between the apartment door and the bathroom that could have come from the
    assailant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Moore testified that if the steel bar was
    indeed the murder weapon, given the length of the bar and the direction of the
    blood spatter, the bar would have had a shielding effect. However, the lower
    portion of the killer’s feet or lower leg might have been hit by blood.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        v) The bloodstain footprints</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Constable Moore also found bloodstain
    footprints on the carpet near the bottom of the stairs to the loft. In his
    opinion, someone had stepped in a pool of blood at the base of the stairs and
    had then transferred it onto the carpet as he walked away from the stairs
    towards the living room or towards the door of the apartment. Several shoes,
    including Lane's, were seized and analyzed. In Detective Constable Moore's
    opinion, Lane's shoes could have caused the footprints. When Lane's left shoe

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several swabs were taken during the autopsy. Subsequent
    analysis showed that the appellant's sperm was present in small quantities on
    swabs taken in the high vaginal area (near the cervix), in the low vaginal area
    (near the vulva), and on two swabs taken in the buttocks area. An initial test
    showed there was a single sperm present on an oral swab, but there was not
    enough genetic material to allow DNA testing. Analysis of the stains found on
    the deceased's underwear showed the appellant's semen was present in one stain
    on the larger portion of the underwear. His DNA was not detected in the smaller
    stains. No semen stains were found on the smaller fragment of the underwear.
    Tests conducted on the inside and outside of the deceased’s jeans did not
    detect semen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the physical examination of the deceased, Dr.
    Rao found there was not a large amount of semen in the high vaginal area. She
    also found “absolutely no injury” to the vulva and “no bruise, no tear, [and]
    no abrasion” to the vaginal canal near the cervix. Dr. Rao explained that the
    absence of injury did not rule out sexual assault. However, she agreed that the
    absence of injury was also entirely consistent with consensual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Lawrence Komer, a gynaecologist called by the
    defence, explained that in his experience, consensual intercourse is less
    likely to cause injury because it usually involves better lubrication. On the
    other hand, non-consensual intercourse usually results in some damage, even if
    it is minor. However, he agreed that the literature suggests that visible
    injuries are observed in only a minority of cases.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        vii) The semen leakage evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rao testified that if a woman had sexual
    intercourse, dressed and walked around, one would expect to see semen staining
    on her clothing and on the exterior of the body (including the vulval and anal
    areas) caused by the leakage of semen from her vagina. She acknowledged that at
    the preliminary inquiry, she had testified that there was “a possibility” of
    such leakage. At trial, she said, “I think it normally happens ... Maybe I
    shouldn't have said it ‘can’. It will happen.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rao acknowledged she had done no studies of semen
    or its flow from the vagina. Moreover, she agreed that the articles she had
    read since the preliminary inquiry did not provide her with any additional
    information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to being qualified as an expert in
    gynaecology, Dr. Komer was qualified to give opinion evidence regarding the
    properties of seminal fluid and its interface with the vagina. He testified
    that the average healthy male ejaculates between two to five cubic centimetres
    of semen. In his opinion, the large stain on the deceased’s underwear would
    represent a fair portion of the semen from a normal ejaculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to a hypothetical question, Dr. Komer
    agreed that the amount of semen he saw on the deceased's underwear would be
    consistent with the appellant's description of his interaction with the
    deceased. He also agreed that there could still have been some semen available
    to be deposited into the vagina. Dr. Komer testified that the more semen that
    is deposited in the vagina, the more likely it is to leak out. Depending on how
    much semen is in the vagina, there may not be a sufficient amount available to
    leak out. However, he was unable to say how small that volume would need to be.
    Moreover, leakage would depend on the individual case and he acknowledged he
    had never examined the appellant.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.       Analysis    <i></i></span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.  Did the trial judge err by permitting Dr. Rao
    to give expert evidence on semen leakage and further err in her instructions to
    the jury concerning the semen issue?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge made several
    errors in relation to the semen leakage evidence. First, the trial judge erred
    in permitting Dr. Rao to give opinion evidence on semen leakage, a subject that
    was beyond her expertise as a forensic pathologist. Second, the trial judge
    failed to instruct the jury on the effect of Dr. Rao’s inconsistent opinion
    given at the preliminary inquiry. Third, the trial judge minimized the fact of
    the inconsistent opinion in her review of Dr. Rao’s evidence. Fourth, the trial
    judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on how to weigh conflicting expert
    opinion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept any of these submissions.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The substance of Dr. Rao's evidence on this issue was
    that seminal fluid deposited inside the vagina can flow out of the vagina due
    to gravity.  Seminal fluid can flow out
    of the vagina and stay on “exterior surfaces of the body”. It can also stain
    the anal and vulval area, and it can stain clothing. Moreover, one would expect
    leakage of deposited semen to occur following intercourse if the woman was up
    and walking around.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, Dr. Rao expressed the view that
    this leakage “normally happens”. Dr. Rao also testified that it is possible for
    seminal fluid that is on an exterior surface of the body to flow into the
    interior area of the vagina if the person is lying on her back.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject the appellant’s submission that the trial
    judge erred by failing to instruct the jury to disregard Dr. Rao's evidence on
    semen leakage because it was outside her area of expertise. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rao is a forensic pathologist and was qualified to
    offer opinions in the areas of the observation, investigation, interpretation
    and causation of injury to human beings. During a <i>voir dire</i> related to this specific line of questioning, Dr. Rao
    testified that, as part of her training and education as a forensic
    pathologist, she was trained to investigate, collect and detect evidence of
    sexual assault. This training included education on the movement of semen, how
    long semen can survive in the vaginal canal and in the cervix, and how long it
    can remain in a dead person. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, Dr. Rao was qualified by virtue of her
    training and experience to give opinion evidence on this subject and the
    matters being raised on appeal go to the weight to be afforded to her evidence
    rather than to its admissibility based on her expertise. Finally, we note that
    although defence counsel at trial initially objected to the Crown pursuing this
    line of questioning with Dr. Rao, ultimately he abandoned his objection.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave the jury standard instructions
    relating to “prior inconsistent statements of a non-accused witness”. On
    appeal, the appellant contends that those instructions were inadequate to deal
    with Dr. Rao’s evidence for two reasons. First, because the standard
    instructions were given well after the trial judge reviewed Dr. Rao's evidence.
    Second, because the instructions referred to inconsistencies in a witness’s
    “version of events” as opposed to inconsistencies in a witness’s opinion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to these arguments. We have no
    reason to believe that the jury would have approached the trial judge's
    instructions in a piecemeal fashion or that it would have failed to take
    account of general instructions addressing the jury's approach to evidence
    because they were given after the trial judge reviewed some of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, although the trial judge's instructions
    referred in places to a witness’s “version of events”, the instructions about
    inconsistencies began with this important proposition: “When a witness says one
    thing in the witness box but has said something quite different on an earlier
    occasion, your common sense tells you that the fact that the witness has given
    different versions may be important in deciding how much or whether you believe
    or rely on that witness’s testimony.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the instructions reminded the jury that
    several witnesses were examined about differences between their trial testimony
    and their preliminary inquiry testimony. When the trial judge reviewed Dr.
    Rao’s evidence, she referred specifically to the fact that Dr. Rao was
    cross-examined about “an inconsistency between her trial testimony and that
    provided at an earlier preliminary hearing.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we see no air of reality to the
    suggestion that the jury would not have applied the prior inconsistent
    statement instruction to Dr. Rao’s evidence.</p>

    trial judge’s charge, defence counsel at trial objected to the fact that the
    trial judge told the jury that Dr. Rao testified in re-examination that she had
    read some additional material when preparing to testify at trial but failed to
    remind the jury that Dr. Rao acknowledged that the additional material did not
    add anything to what she knew previously. The trial judge declined to re-charge
    on this point. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant renews his objection, arguing
    that the trial judge’s summary of Dr. Rao’s evidence minimized the effect of
    the alleged inconsistency in her evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although we agree that it might have been preferable
    had the trial judge re-charged as requested, we are satisfied that the trial
    judge’s instructions alerted the jury to the alleged inconsistency in Dr. Rao’s
    evidence. Moreover, the instructions also made it clear that it was the jury’s
    recollection of the evidence that was important, not the trial judge’s. In this
    instance, the Crown asked Dr. Rao two questions in re-examination, both related
    to the same issue. It is difficult to conceive how the jury would have missed
    the bottom-line of the evidence given in re-examination, namely, that the
    additional articles Dr. Rao had read did not provide her with any further
    information. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Re-charging to expand on the trial judge’s summary of
    the evidence is always a difficult problem because the parties almost
    inevitably disagree on what should be included in the re-charge. In the
    circumstances of this case, we are not persuaded the trial judge erred by
    failing to re-charge as requested. </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The opinions of experts are just like the testimony
    of any other witnesses. Just because an expert has given an opinion does not
    require you to accept it. You may believe or rely upon the opinion as much or
    as little as you see fit. You should consider the education, training and
    experience of the expert, the reasons given for the opinion, the suitability of

    much or how little to rely on the opinions. It is up to you to decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During pre-charge discussions, the Crown submitted that
    it was unnecessary to give an instruction from Watt J.A.'s <i>Ontario Specimen Jury Instructions (Criminal)</i> (Toronto: Thomson
    Carswell, 2002), regarding a conflict in expert opinions because the only
    potential conflict was between the evidence of Drs. Rao and Komer, and there
    was no real disagreement between their opinions. Defence counsel at trial
    agreed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant submits that because the
    opinions of the two experts diverged on a key issue, it was incumbent on the
    trial judge to further assist the jury concerning how to weigh the competing
    opinions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. Like the trial judge
    and counsel present at the trial, we see no basis for concluding that the
    opinions of Drs. Rao and Komer were clearly conflicting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Dr. Rao testified that semen leakage normally
    happens due to gravity, she did not unequivocally disavow her evidence at the
    preliminary inquiry that leakage might not occur if “ejaculation is high into
    the canal”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Defence Counsel: ...Would you agree that your
    answers appeared to admit the possibility that seminal fluid that had been
    deposited in the vagina would not necessarily have leaked, so as to leak out
    and thereby necessarily get on garments that would be in contact with the
    vagina?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Rao: That's what I said, yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Defence Counsel: And … I hear your evidence that
    doesn’t sound like you’re admitting that possibility right now. Would you admit
    that possibility right now?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Rao: I suppose since I committed, it can; but
    most of the time, again, if there’s been an ejaculation into the vaginal area
    and if there is movement, the position changed from horizontal to vertical
    there can, through gravity, there can be some leakage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the focus of Dr. Rao's evidence at trial was
    not about the possibility that leakage would not occur depending on the amount
    of semen deposited. Read together, we see no significant difference between her
    evidence and that of Dr. Komer, who testified that if only a small amount of
    semen is deposited, semen may not leak out as a result of gravity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, this aspect of the evidence of both
    doctors strikes us as being, to a large extent, a matter of common sense that
    did not require complex instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, we conclude that it was
    unnecessary for the trial judge to provide the jury with additional instructions
    concerning how to approach the expert evidence.</p>
  <h3>2. Did the trial judge err in her instructions
    to the jury by improperly revealing that the appellant had a criminal record? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave the jury a standard instruction
    concerning how to approach prior convictions of non-accused witnesses. In the
    course of doing so, she told the jury that the instruction applied to a
    specific list of witnesses “who admitted that they have previously been
    convicted of various criminal offences.” The trial judge then said, “[This
    instruction] does not apply to [the appellant].” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that this instruction had the
    effect of conveying to the jury that the appellant had a criminal record and
    that the instruction was both improper and prejudicial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not accept this submission. The trial judge began
    this instruction with the following words: “Let's talk a bit about previous
    convictions of non-accused witnesses. That is, the criminal records that were
    introduced.” She then set out the list of witnesses to whom the instruction applied
    and made the impugned comment, “It does not apply to Carl Hall.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read fairly, the trial judge was doing no more
    than making it abundantly clear to the jury that the instruction did not apply
    to the appellant. Further, no suggestion was made at the trial that the
    appellant had a criminal record. Moreover, the jury was given standard
    instructions to act only on the evidence led and not to speculate. In all the
    circumstances, we cannot agree with the suggestion that the jury would have
    leapt to the conclusion that the appellant had a criminal record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having explained why we reject these grounds of appeal,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the course of the trial, the trial judge asked
    counsel to provide her with brief synopses of their respective positions to
    assist in preparing her jury charge. Trial counsel made their closing addresses
    on Wednesday, February 15, 2006 and undertook to provide their synopses first
    thing the following morning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel apparently did not receive the defence
    synopsis until the evening of Thursday, February 16, 2006. On Friday, February
    17, 2006, just before the trial judge was about to begin her jury instructions,
    Crown counsel objected to the defence synopsis, claiming that it was an attempt
    to reply to the Crown's jury address. The trial judge suggested that counsel
    attempt to resolve the matter as the day progressed and proceeded with her
    instructions to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the lunch break, the trial judge agreed it was
    inappropriate for counsel to attempt to enlarge on their closing addresses in
    their synopses, and once again encouraged counsel to resolve the matter. When
    that did not occur, the trial judge set out the position of the Crown and the
    defence in brief compass in her jury charge as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The theory of the Crown is that they have proven
    their case against Mr. Hall beyond a reasonable doubt. They suggest that the
    expert evidence that you have heard proves such sufficiently so as to leave you
    with no doubt. Crown points to the inconsistencies in Mr. Hall's [statement to
    the police] and his conversation with Ms. McLean, subsequently, as
    demonstrative of Mr. Hall's attempts to distance himself from the murder.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In a nutshell, the theory of the defence case is
    that the Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Carl Hall killed
    Jackie McLean … As you will recall, Carl Hall indicates that he did not kill
    her <span class=GramE>but,</span> rather, he indicates that it is Barry Lane
    who did so. The defence say that Mr. Lane had the motive, robbery, and the
    opportunity to kill Ms. McLean and that Mr. Hall had neither. Most
    particularly, based on the evidence of the witnesses, the defence position is
    that he had insufficient time to do what was alleged. Counsel, in a similar
    fashion to the Crown, relies on the weaknesses of Barry Lane's story. His inconsistencies
    and failure to admit ever having anything to do with Ms. McLean over the course
    of that night is demonstrative of his attempts to distance himself from the
    murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a brief re-charge at the request of defence counsel,
    the trial judge clarified that, although it was the defence position at trial
    that Lane was the killer, Mr. Hall did not suggest that Lane was the
    perpetrator in his statement to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>                        ii)
    The appellant's position on appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in
    setting out the defence position by focusing on counsel's alternative suspect
    argument and ignoring the primary defence, namely, that the appellant had
    consensual sexual intercourse with the deceased but did not kill her. Moreover,
    the trial judge failed to direct the jury’s attention to important aspects of
    the evidence that supported the defence position.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            iii) Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Sharpe J.A. wrote in <i>R. v. Mahalingan </i>(2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 35 (C.A.), at para. 15:
    “[T]here is no simple template that can be uniformly applied when instructing a
    jury and no simple formula by which an appellate court can assess the adequacy
    of a jury charge.” Despite this, there are some elements that must be present
    in order for a charge to the jury to be adequate. In <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
    27, Doherty J.A. explained that by the end of a trial judge’s jury instruction,
    the jury must understand: </p>

    to the positions taken by the parties on the various issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following statement of Taschereau J. in <i>Azoulay v. The Queen, </i>[1952] S.C.R. 495,
    at pp. 497-98, has often been cited in reference to this point:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rule which has been laid down, and consistently
    followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare cases
    where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the
    evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may
    appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be
    applied to the facts as they find them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the primary defence position at
    trial was simple. The appellant acknowledged having consensual sexual
    intercourse with the deceased but maintained that he did not kill her. Further,
    the defence submitted that Barry Lane could well have been the killer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, while the primary defence position at trial
    was simple, it consisted of several elements, some of which were nuanced and
    therefore required explanation. In the circumstances, it was necessary that the
    trial judge refer to the evidence in some detail for the defence position to be
    understood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s expert evidence about the blood spatter on
    the deceased’s underwear stood essentially unchallenged and created an
    overwhelming inference that the deceased was wearing her underwear when she was
    killed. Although the appellant said initially in his statement to the police
    that the deceased left her underwear in the room after they had consensual
    intercourse, later in his statement, he indicated that he did not watch the
    deceased get dressed. He also said the deceased’s underwear was “in one piece I
    think.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the primary defence position at trial was
    premised, at least in part, on the jury drawing an inference that the deceased
    put her underwear back on following intercourse. Moreover, for the jury to
    appreciate the availability of this inference, it was necessary to draw its attention
    to the latter portion of the appellant’s statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, contrary to the Crown’s position that the
    expert evidence undermined the appellant’s version of events as set out in his
    statement to the police, the defence maintained that the weight of the evidence
    at trial was consistent with the appellant's version, namely, that he attempted
    to withdraw during consensual intercourse and that he did not watch the
    deceased get dressed afterwards, leaving open the possibility that the deceased
    put her underwear back on following intercourse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Examples of such evidence were, first, that Dr. Rao
    found no injury to the deceased's vulva or vagina. Dr. Komer testified that
    non-consensual intercourse usually results in some damage, even if it is minor.
    Dr. Rao agreed that the absence of injury was entirely consistent with
    consensual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, Dr. Komer’s evidence was capable of supporting
    the appellant’s description of attempting to withdraw before ejaculating and
    ejaculating into the deceased’s underwear, and his remark to the effect that he
    may have started to ejaculate before he could withdraw completely. In response
    to a hypothetical question at trial, Dr. Komer confirmed that the amount of
    semen on the deceased’s underwear was consistent with the male attempting to
    withdraw at the time of ejaculation. Also potentially consistent with the
    appellant’s version of events, Dr. Rao found only a small amount of semen in
    the high vaginal area. Moreover, Dr. Komer testified that, depending on how
    much semen is in the vagina, none may be available to leak out. Dr. Rao's
    evidence did not address, and therefore did not contradict, this specific
    point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further evidence capable of supporting the defence
    position was that neither Crystal nor the people at the Detox Centre who dealt
    with the appellant observed blood on his clothing or any injuries on his
    body.  Forensic evidence at the scene
    suggested that the killer would have had blood on his clothing or on his body.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An additional element of the defence position as
    articulated in defence counsel’s closing was that the Crown failed to elicit
    direct evidence from its experts that would have supported key aspects of its
    case.  In particular, the Crown adduced
    no direct evidence to support its position that if the victim put on her
    underwear and jeans after intercourse with the appellant, semen would necessarily
    transfer from the deceased's underwear to her jeans. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, a cursory description of the
    defence position that failed to even mention the theory of consensual
    intercourse and that also failed to describe the evidence capable of supporting
    that theory was simply not adequate to fairly present the position of the
    defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Doherty J.A. explained in <i>MacKinnon</i>, at para. 29, the trial judge should provide “references
    to the evidence which are sufficient in the context of the case and the
    entirety of the charge to alert the jury to the particular parts of the
    evidence which are significant to particular issues and to the positions taken
    by the parties on those issues.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast with the approach described in <i>MacKinnon</i>, in this case, the trial judge
    recited the evidence of the witnesses without explaining how that evidence
    connected to the appellant’s consensual intercourse theory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, when setting out the position of the defence, the
    trial judge did not direct the jury’s attention to some of the important
    evidence that was capable of supporting the appellant’s claim that Barry Lane
    was the killer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, the trial judge did not direct the jury’s
    attention to the evidence about Lane’s continuing presence at the Sandbar Hotel
    after the party; about him “lurking” in the third-floor hallway; about his
    presence and strange behaviour soon after the deceased’s body was found; about
    the fact that he was not wearing a shirt after the murder; that his bloody
    footprints were found in the apartment leading away from a pool of the
    deceased’s blood; or that the victim’s blood was found on the bottom of Lane’s
    shoes, on the side of the sole and on one of the shoelace eyelets. Similarly,
    the trial judge did not remind the jury that a third person’s DNA was found on
    the deceased’s underwear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although we have no doubt that the jury was well aware
    that the appellant claimed he had consensual sexual intercourse with the
    deceased but did not kill her, in the circumstances, we conclude that the trial
    judge erred in law by failing to fully explain the position of the defence and
    to outline the evidence that was capable of supporting it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We appreciate that the trial judge in this case was put
    in a difficult position because of the eleventh hour dispute between <span
class=GramE>counsel</span> about the defence position as articulated in the defence
    synopsis. In our view, the practice adopted by many trial judges of asking
    counsel to submit a brief statement of their respective positions to assist
    with preparation of the jury charge is a good one. Nonetheless, it remains the
    trial judge’s obligation to ensure that the positions of the parties and the
    evidence supporting their respective positions are properly explained to the
    jury. <a name="_GoBack"></a>  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4. Did the
    trial judge err in her instructions to the jury concerning the appellant’s
    post-offence conduct?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his closing, Crown counsel referred to three
    conversations that the appellant had following the murder: two with his
    girlfriend, Crystal McLean, and one with the police following his arrest. The
    trial judge identified the two conversations with Crystal as possible examples
    of post-offence conduct and instructed the jury on them accordingly.  In closing submissions, the Crown pointed to
    the appellant’s statement to the police as a fabricated statement and as
    evidence of a fabricated alibi.  In the
    charge, the trial judge referred in passing to the Crown’s suggested
    interpretation of the statement to police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In our view, the
    trial judge’s instructions on the post-offence conduct evidence relied on by
    the Crown – the appellant’s conversations with Crystal and his statement to the
    police – were flawed in several respects. In addition, the appellant’s statement
    to the police was admitted as an alleged fabricated exculpatory statement
    without proper regard to the legal principles governing its admissibility as
    such, and without charging the jury on the proper approach to the use of the
    statement. Taken together, these flaws constitute reversible error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We first explain the deficiencies in the charge related
    to the appellant’s statements to Crystal and then discuss the errors related to
    the treatment of the appellant’s statement to the police. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            i)  The appellant’s conversations with Crystal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first conversation between the appellant and
    Crystal that the Crown relied on as post-offence conduct evidence occurred at
    the Wesley Centre on the night of the murder. Crystal testified that when the
    appellant arrived at the Wesley Centre, he told her that he had done something
    bad, and he “didn’t want to explain anything to me.”  She also testified that the appellant said
    that he wanted to leave with her for the west, as they had previously
    discussed.   However, she broke up with
    him and he left.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second conversation tendered by the Crown between
    the appellant and Crystal occurred some 8 months later, on March 8, 2002 when,
    at the behest of the police, Crystal visited the appellant where he was
    incarcerated at Penetanguishene, near Midland. The fact of his incarceration
    was not disclosed to the jury. She told the appellant that the police were
    asking her questions about him and about the night they split up.  The Midland conversation lasted approximately
    30-minutes and was audio-recorded and transcribed by police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Crystal was asked by both Crown counsel in
    examination in chief and by defence counsel in cross-examination to read aloud
    various portions of the Midland conversation to the jury.  The Crown asked her to read out some seven
    extracts from this conversation.  For
    present purposes, it is only necessary to give examples of the extracted
    passages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the first portion of the conversation elicited by
    the Crown, the appellant told Crystal to tell the police nothing. He
    immediately went on to tell her to tell the police “[t]hat you seen me, I don’t
    know. Tell them everything that happened.  I’ve got nothing to hide. Like I don’t know what this is about... I’ve
    got nothing to hide. Tell them whatever.  That you seen me and me and you broke up....” He went on to ask Crystal
    to “keep avoiding them, do me that favour... [T]ell them... that I was with you
    that night.  We argued, but I was with
    you for a good hour.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a later passage elicited by the Crown, Crystal asked
    the appellant if she should tell police that he was with her “the whole
    night”.  The following exchange ensued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:        With you for a couple of hours.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crystal:           During what time frame?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       I don’t know.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crystal:           Say
    midnight till three or 11 till three or something?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:   Before that, yeah, whatever, I don’t – I
    don’t know – whatever.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crystal:           You were with me the whole night.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Basically, just about, yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crystal:           All
    right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       After
    I left, say he was with Barry for a little bit split up with him and he was
    with me.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the next reference elicited by the Crown, the
    appellant said to Crystal that he was with her “for a while”.  She said maybe for “like 45 minutes.”  He replied: “Over an hour.” She responded:
    “Like 45 minutes.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last exchange relied on by the Crown was as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crystal:           So
    you just want me to tell them you were with me most of the night? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:       Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crystal:           All right I can do that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appellant:
          Tell them nothing though, if you
    can, you know what I mean?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, defence counsel asked Crystal to
    read portions of the conversation that had occurred either soon before or after
    the passages elicited by the Crown.  For
    example, in a passage that came before the first extract read in chief, Crystal
    told the appellant that the police wanted to talk to her about him and asked
    what he wanted her to say. He replied: “Whatever.”  She asked him what had happened that night
    and he replied: “Nothing happened that night.  What are you talking about?”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence also had Crystal read a passage that followed
    the first extract elicited by the Crown.  Crystal told the appellant that he should let her know what to tell
    police before she tells them something and “our stories don’t match up.”  He responded: “[T]ell them I was with you
    that night for a little while.  We
    argued.  That’s it.  What else can you tell them, what else can
    you?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his closing address, Crown counsel suggested to the
    jury that in the Midland conversation, the appellant was trying to provide
    himself with a false alibi. Crown counsel stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here again, Mr. Hall is purposefully, purposefully
    trying to expand the amount of time that he spent with Crystal at a very
    crucial time in the evening. He’s very much trying to provide himself with an
    alibi. You might very well ask yourself why an innocent man would tell a
    witness, a witness to his whereabouts at that very crucial point in time: a)
    avoid the police; b) tell them nothing; or, failing the above, c) tell them she
    was with him for most of the night.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her charge, discussed below, the trial judge
    referred to both conversations with Crystal under the heading of post-offence
    conduct.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            ii)
    The law on post-offence conduct evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The significance of post-offence conduct evidence and
    the proper approach to such evidence by a jury, including the rejection of the
    traditional label, “consciousness of guilt”, was explained by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>R. v. White </i>(1998), 125
    C.C.C. (3d) 385. The court adopted the following succinct explanation of the
    logical significance of post-offence conduct by Weiler J.A. from <i>R. v. Peavoy</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226
    (Ont. C.A.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Evidence of after-the-fact conduct is commonly
    admitted to show that an accused person has acted in a manner which, based on
    human experience and logic, is consistent with the conduct of a guilty person
    and inconsistent with the conduct of an innocent person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the problem with post-offence conduct evidence
    is that it is often at best equivocal, and as the court stated in <i>White </i>at para. 22, “susceptible to jury
    error”. Evidence of post-offence conduct is not evidence of the commission of a
    crime or its planning, which a jury can assess to determine the facts of an
    event and the identity of the perpetrator. Rather, it is evidence of what
    someone did after an event, which proves nothing directly, but from which the
    jury is asked to conduct a psychological analysis of what a person logically
    would or might do in given circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court in <i>White</i> observed that the label “consciousness of guilt” should not be used for two
    reasons. First, the label reflects a conclusion of guilt before any analysis or
    weighing of the available inferences from the conduct. Second, it suggests that
    this evidence is a special category, rather than just a piece of circumstantial
    evidence to be weighed with all of the other evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court in <i>White</i> went on to reject the defence position that the criminal
    standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which applies to the ultimate
    verdict, should also be applied to evidence of post-offence conduct. The court
    reiterated the basic proposition that the criminal standard of proof applies
    only to the final determination of guilt or innocence and not to individual items
    of evidence, including post-offence conduct evidence.  Therefore, the jury does not first determine
    beyond a reasonable doubt whether the Crown’s interpretation of the impugned
    post-offence conduct is the correct one before considering that evidence in the
    context of all the other evidence. It may be only in the latter context that
    the jury can fully and properly assess the significance of the accused’s
    conduct. As stated by the court at para. 57, it is “preferable simply…to leave
    evidence of flight or concealment evaluated, but somewhat at large until the
    final stage of putting all the evidence together and seeing if it proves the
    case beyond a reasonable doubt.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court explained, at para. 54, that applying the
    criminal standard of proof to post-offence conduct would “set the deliberation
    process backwards”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]nstead of directing the jury to use the evidence
    of post-offence conduct in their determination of guilt or innocence, it would
    require them to decide the ultimate issue as a predicate to using the evidence
    in the first place. It would collapse the entire jury deliberation into an
    analysis of the significance of a single act of the accused, and would make all
    the other evidence in the case merely supportive of that determination. Such an
    instruction would have the perverse effect of transforming any piece of
    evidence of after-the-fact conduct, no matter how minor in the scheme of the
    Crown’s case, into crucial evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court did not articulate specific language to be
    used in instructing juries on how to assess and approach evidence of
    post-offence conduct. However, in the course of deciding the issue of the
    standard of proof that should be applied by the jury to post-offence conduct
    evidence, the court suggested a number of explanations and cautions that a
    trial judge should give to the jury as part of the charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge must provide a clear cautionary
    instruction to the jury against drawing incriminating inferences from
    post-offence conduct without considering alternate explanations for the
    impugned conduct.  The trial judge must
    also instruct the jury that “they should reserve their final judgment about the
    meaning of the accused’s conduct until all the evidence has been considered in
    the normal course of their deliberations”:  <i>White</i>, at para. 57.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As noted by the
    court at para. 21, post-offence conduct evidence is like other pieces of
    circumstantial evidence that may be subject to competing interpretations. To
    meet the circumstantial evidence test, “[it] must be weighed by the jury, in
    light of all the evidence, to determine whether it is consistent with guilt and
    inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it is unlike other pieces of circumstantial
    evidence in a very significant way. Other circumstantial evidence, such as the
    classic example of wet ground in the morning, need only be consistent with a
    conclusion that a certain fact occurred, e.g., that it rained overnight. That
    fact might be an important piece of the Crown’s case. But it is just one piece
    that, together with others, may prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The
    difference with post-offence conduct circumstantial evidence is that, to be
    evidence that meets the circumstantial evidence test, it must be consistent
    only with the ultimate conclusion of guilt. It is the requirement of meeting
    the test for circumstantial evidence that creates the impression of a
    tautological analytical exercise by the jury. That is why it is so important
    for the jury to assess the post-offence conduct only as part of its ultimate
    assessment in weighing all of the evidence at the stage of determining whether
    guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than treating it as a
    separate category.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having set out the applicable law, we now assess the
    appellant’s objections to the trial judge’s instructions on the use the jury
    could make of the appellant’s conversations with Crystal as possible
    post-offence conduct evidence. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            iii)
    The appellant’s objections to the charge on post-offence conduct        related to the conversations with Crystal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her charge on post-offence conduct related to the
    appellant’s two conversations with Crystal, the trial judge provided the jury
    with the warnings and cautions required by the Supreme Court in <i>White</i>.  First, she warned the jury not to jump to the conclusion from the
    conversations with Crystal that the appellant was conscious of committing the
    offence charged. Second, she told the jury that there could be other
    explanations for his conduct. She also told the jury that they must not use the
    evidence of what the appellant said or did afterwards in deciding or helping
    decide that he committed the offence unless they rejected any other explanation
    for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asserts two objections to the charge on
    post-offence conduct. The appellant’s first objection is to the concluding
    paragraph of the trial judge’s post-offence conduct instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you do not or cannot find that Carl Hall did or
    said those things because he was conscious of having done what is alleged
    against him, you must not use this evidence in deciding or helping you decide
    that Carl Hall committed the offence charged. On the other hand, if you find
    that anything Carl Hall did or said afterwards was because he was conscious of
    having done what is alleged against him, you may consider this evidence
    together with all of the other evidence in reaching your verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that this wording invited the
    jury to engage in the tautological reasoning that the Supreme Court disapproved
    of in <i>White</i>, namely, requiring them to
    determine whether the appellant was conscious that he committed the offence
    before they could use the post-offence conduct evidence to decide if he
    committed the offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We share this concern.  This instruction directed the jury to decide whether the appellant
    engaged in the post-offence conduct <i>because
    he was conscious that he committed the offence</i>. The jury was thus invited
    to jump directly to the issue of guilt as a precondition to deciding the use
    they would make of the post-offence conduct evidence; that is, conducting the
    deliberation process backwards as described in <i>White</i>, albeit not beyond a reasonable doubt as in that case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant acknowledges that the wording
    for the trial judge’s charge in this case is based on Watt J.A.’s <i>Ontario Specimen Jury Instructions
    (Criminal): 2005 Supplement </i>(Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2005) at p. 72. The
    template for the above paragraph from the <i>2005
    Supplement</i> revises the wording that appeared in the 2002 edition of the <i>Specimen Jury Instructions</i>. It appears
    that the purpose of the revised wording in the model charge is to benefit the
    accused by ensuring that a jury will use post-offence conduct as a piece of
    circumstantial evidence only if it is consistent with guilt and nothing else.
    However, the wording of the charge is such that the jury is asked to decide if
    the accused acted in the way he did <i>because </i>he is conscious that he committed the offence.  This direction runs afoul of the holding in <i>White</i> that the jury is not to treat
    post-offence conduct evidence as a special category of circumstantial evidence,
    but rather is only to weigh the post-offence conduct evidence together with the
    rest of the evidence when deciding the issue of guilt or innocence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  To be
    consistent with <i>White</i> and the context
    in which the jury is to properly assess post-offence conduct evidence, the jury
    should instead be instructed along the lines suggested by the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Menard</i> (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d)
    416, at para. 24.  Adapting  the language used in <i>Menard</i> to the facts of this case, the last paragraph of the charge
    on post-offence conduct evidence could  have  read:   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whether Mr. Hall’s statements to Crystal, either at
    the Wesley Center or in Midland, are attempts by him to conceal his role in the
    murder is for you to decide. Remember that you must look at this matter in
    light of all the evidence and it is on a consideration of all the evidence that
    you decide whether the Crown has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Standing on its
    own, this flaw in the charge would not constitute reversible error.  Indeed, we note that this specific objection
    to the charge was not raised by defence counsel at trial. However, there were
    other deficiencies in the charge on post-offence conduct in this case that, taken
    together, amount to legal error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These deficiencies relate to the trial judge’s failure
    to articulate the theory of why the appellant’s Midland conversation should be
    linked with guilt, and her failure to fully and fairly summarize this body of
    evidence and to explain to the jury possible alternative and innocent
    explanations for his statements to Crystal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Crown
    presented the Midland conversation as evidence that the appellant was trying to
    get Crystal to expand the time they were together in order to provide him with
    a false alibi. However, his statements in their totality can be viewed as quite
    equivocal. For example, although at one point the appellant tells her to tell
    the police nothing, in the next breath he tells her to tell them “everything
    that happened, I’ve got nothing to hide.” At various points in the
    conversation, the appellant asked Crystal to tell police that they were
    together “a little while”, or for “a good hour” – in other words, timeframes
    that would not provide him with a complete alibi. While it is true that at
    other points in the conversation, the appellant agreed that Crystal should tell
    police they were together the whole night, he did so only after Crystal
    repeatedly suggested to him that she should tell the police this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also of concern is that Crystal’s evidence of her
    conversation with the appellant at Midland came out in a disjointed manner at
    trial. Crown counsel highlighted seven areas that he asked her to read out. In
    cross-examination, defence counsel asked her to read other portions, some of
    which either temporally preceded or came after the sections she had read in
    chief.  It would have been difficult for
    the jury to follow how the conversation actually unfolded.  Rather than assist the jury to sort out the
    meaning of this entire conversation in the charge, the trial judge recited only
    from the sections of the conversation that were elicited by the Crown.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge warned the jury that it was
    particularly important to consider evidence of any other explanations for the
    appellant’s conduct, she did not suggest to them what other possible
    explanations there were. One alternative was that the appellant was not trying
    to establish a false alibi, but was essentially telling Crystal to tell the
    police what she knew.  He initially
    requested that she tell the police that she had seen him that night “like for a
    good hour”, which was not far from the time established by the surveillance
    cameras at the Wesley Centre. While he later agreed with Crystal’s suggestion
    that she tell police they were together the whole night, a jury might conclude
    that it was actually Crystal who was suggesting the false alibi on her own
    initiative and not at the appellant’s behest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In pre-charge submissions, the appellant’s trial counsel
    objected to the characterization of the Midland conversation as post-offence
    conduct evidence. In our view, there was merit to that objection.  Indeed given the highly equivocal nature of
    the Midland conversation, before allowing the Crown to tender this conversation
    as post-offence conduct evidence, it was incumbent on the trial judge to decide
    its admissibility as such.  Having
    admitted the conversation, it was particularly important for the trial judge to
    review its contents in an even-handed manner and to set out to the jury the
    possible alternative interpretations that were consistent with innocence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding the appellant’s conversation with Crystal at
    the Wesley Centre on the night of the murder, the trial judge failed to tell
    the jury that it was only available as possible post-offence conduct if the
    conversation occurred after the offence was committed.  Otherwise, of course, the conversation could
    not support an inference that the conduct reflected a consciousness of having
    committed the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown had two alternate theories for the timing of
    the offence.  One was that the murder
    took place before this conversation, while the alternate theory was that the
    appellant committed the murder after Crystal broke up with him at the Wesley Centre
    and before he went to the Detox Centre.  If the conversation occurred before the murder, then the content
    corroborated the appellant’s story to police that he had consensual sex with
    the victim.  His reference to having done
    something bad could be about having sex with a prostitute, and Crystal’s
    comment that he “smelled like a whore” could support his story to the
    police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead of pointing out this alternative explanation
    for the first conversation with Crystal, which would have supported the defence
    theory of the case, the trial judge permitted the jury to assume that this
    conversation occurred after the offence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cumulative effect of the deficiencies in the charge
    regarding the use to be made of the appellant’s conversations with Crystal was
    to leave the jury without the tools to properly analyze and weigh the
    significance of these conversations as post-offence conduct, with the result
    that the jury may have given that evidence much more prejudicial significance
    than was warranted. The effect of these deficiencies in the charge on
    post-offence conduct related to the conversations with Crystal was compounded
    by the trial judge’s treatment of the appellant’s statement to the police.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            <span
class=GramE>iv) The</span> appellant’s statement to the police following his arrest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The week before the appellant’s arrest on March 16,
    2002, the police took a DNA sample from him. When they matched it with the
    semen found at the scene of the murder, they arrested the appellant and
    conducted an interview where he gave the exculpatory statement explaining the
    DNA match by saying that he had had consensual sex with the victim that evening
    and left her alive at the apartment party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown wanted to introduce the statement, apparently
    in order to argue that the appellant concocted a false explanation for his
    semen at the scene and that he was giving a false alibi to the police, while
    the defence objected to its introduction. A <i>voir
    dire</i> was held where the two issues were voluntariness and right to counsel.
    No issue was raised nor was any ruling made on the admissibility of the
    statement as a fabricated exculpatory statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his closing address to the jury, Crown counsel
    suggested five times that the appellant had fabricated his story of consensual
    sex in his statement to the police in order to provide an innocent, but false,
    explanation for his semen at the scene. To that end, Crown counsel told the
    jury that the appellant purposely lied about two subjects: the romantic nature
    of the time he spent with the deceased to support the consensual nature of the
    intercourse; and the amount of time he spent with Crystal in order to try to
    give <span class=GramE>himself</span> an alibi. After elaborating on these two
    themes with details from the evidence, the Crown linked the police statement
    with the Midland conversation, from which he picked out only the portions where
    the appellant said to tell the police nothing, or that she was with him most of
    the night.  The Crown told the jury that
    the appellant was again purposefully lying to give himself an alibi.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not give the jury an instruction on
    the law regarding false alibi or on the distinction between evidence by an
    accused that is disbelieved and evidence that is concocted, nor was she asked
    by counsel to do so.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law regarding false alibi was discussed by O’Connor
    A.C.J.O. in <i>R. v. O’Connor</i> (2002), 62
    O.R. (3d) 263 (C.A.), at para. 17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is well settled that there is a distinction
    between an alibi that is disbelieved and, therefore, rejected and an alibi that
    is found to be concocted or deliberately fabricated. The former has no
    evidentiary value; the latter can constitute evidence from which an inference
    of guilt may be drawn: <i>R. v. Hibbert</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at pp. 148-52 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Coutts</i> (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.) (<span
class=GramE>leave</span> to appeal dismissed, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 450 (QL));
    and <i>R. v. Blazeiko</i> (2000), 145 C.C.C.
    (3d) 557 (Ont. C.A.). In <i>R. v. Hibbert</i>,
    Arbour J. made it clear at p. 151 that, “[e]ven if an alibi is advanced by the
    accused himself and is rejected, the finding that the alibi is untrue cannot
    serve to corroborate or complement the case for the prosecution, let alone
    permit an inference that the accused is guilty”.  However, where the Crown adduces evidence
    from which it can be inferred that an accused fabricated an alibi, that
    evidence is capable of supporting an inference of guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>O’Connor A.C.J.O. also confirmed at para. 18 that the
    need for independent evidence of fabrication applies not only to disbelieved
    alibis, but to disbelieved exculpatory statements generally. Only where the
    Crown adduces evidence from which it can be adduced that the accused fabricated
    the exculpatory statement can an adverse inference be drawn from it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Coutts</i> (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty J.A. explained the rationale
    for the distinction between a disbelieved exculpatory statement of the accused
    and a concocted statement of the accused and the need for independent evidence
    of concoction, at pp. 551-52:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If triers of fact were routinely told that they
    could infer concoction from disbelief and use that finding of concoction as
    evidence of guilt, it would be far too easy to equate disbelief of an accused’s
    version of events with guilt and to proceed automatically from disbelief of an
    accused to a guilty verdict. That line of reasoning ignores the Crown’s
    obligation to prove an accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. By limiting
    resort to concoction as a separate piece of circumstantial evidence to
    situations where there is evidence of concoction apart from evidence which
    contradicts or discredits the version of events advanced by the accused, the
    law seeks to avoid convictions founded ultimately on the disbelief of the
    accused’s version of events. [References omitted.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>O’Connor,</i> as in this case, the accused’s exculpatory statement to police was admitted
    following a voluntariness and <i>Charter</i> <i>voir dire</i>, with no consideration of
    or ruling on the effect of the Crown’s allegation of fabrication. This was an
    error because, if there was no independent evidence that the exculpatory
    statement was concocted, it had no evidentiary value and should not have been
    admitted into evidence. Quoting again from <i>O’Connor</i>,
    at para. 30:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When the Crown seeks to introduce evidence to show
    that an accused has fabricated out-of-court statement[s], the judge should
    determine at that stage whether there is sufficient evidence of fabrication,
    independent of the evidence tending to show the falsity of the statements,
    which if accepted could reasonably support a finding of fabrication. If there
    is not sufficient evidence to support a finding of fabrication, then the Crown
    should not be permitted to call the evidence showing the accused’s statements
    were false. There would be no purpose in the Crown proving that the accused
    made a false statement if the inference from a conclusion of fabrication is not
    available. To call the evidence showing an accused’s statement is false in that
    circumstance could only tend to confuse the trier of fact and possibly unfairly
    prejudice the accused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>O’Connor,</i> the court set out the procedure to be used when the Crown seeks to have the
    jury draw an inference against the accused based on fabrication. At the
    admissibility stage, the court must address whether there is sufficient
    evidence, independent of the falsity of the statements, to demonstrate
    fabrication. As pointed out by Doherty J.A. in <i>Coutts</i> at para. 16: “Evidence that supports the case for the Crown,
    which if accepted would result in the rejection of the accused’s evidence as
    unworthy of belief, should not be equated with evidence of concoction.”  At the admissibility stage, the trial judge
    must be careful not to treat evidence that demonstrates the falsity of the
    accused’s statement as independent evidence of fabrication. As this court
    explained in <i>R. v. Baltovich </i>(2008),
    73 O.R. (3d) 481, at para. 99:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is axiomatic however, that evidence capable of
    showing an alibi to be false does not automatically translate into evidence
    capable of showing that it has been fabricated.  Were it otherwise, there would be no need for the stringent test that
    must be met before a finding of fabrication, as opposed to falsity, can be
    made.  Having relied upon certain
    evidence to find that an alibi is false, the jury cannot, as a matter of
    course, turn around and use the same evidence to find that the alibi was
    fabricated.  That would constitute
    impermissible bootstrapping and it would effectively nullify the time-honoured
    distinction between a false alibi, which has no evidentiary value, and a
    fabricated alibi, which can be used as circumstantial evidence of guilt.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Examples of evidence capable of constituting
    independent evidence of fabrication are provided in <i>Baltovich</i>, in <i>R. v. Pollock</i> (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 213 (Ont. C.A.), and in <i>O’Connor</i>. In <i>Baltovich</i>,
    this court described the only possible item of independent evidence of
    fabrication on the trial record as a witness’s testimony indicating that the
    accused had attempted to have the witness falsify his evidence as to the time
    he saw the accused on the evening in question.  In <i>Pollock</i>, the independent
    evidence of fabrication was provided by a witness who testified that the
    accused had asked her to give a misleading version of his whereabouts to the
    police on the night of the murder.  In <i>O’Connor</i>, the police interviewed the
    accused before any charges were laid, when he was only a witness and not a
    suspect, and he gave a very detailed, demonstrably false account of his
    whereabouts. The court held that these two factors constituted the independent
    evidence of fabrication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the trial judge concludes that there is sufficient
    independent evidence of fabrication and the alibi or exculpatory evidence is
    admitted, then, as explained in <i>O’Connor</i> at para. 34, the judge must provide a<i> Parrington</i> charge.  A <i>Parrington</i> charge is, in effect, a <i>W.(D.)</i> charge that relates specifically
    to the alibi evidence: <i>R. v. Parrington</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 184 (S.C.C.); <i><span
style='color:#3A3A3A;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>R.</span></i><i><span
style='font-family:"TmsRmn 12pt Italic";color:#3A3A3A;letter-spacing:-.15pt'> v.</span></i><i><span style='color:#3A3A3A;
letter-spacing:-.15pt'> W.(D.) </span></i><span style='color:#3A3A3A;
letter-spacing:-.15pt'>(1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.)</span>. The trial
    judge should direct the jurors that if they do not believe the alibi or
    exculpatory statement, or if they are not left with a reasonable doubt by it,
    they must disregard that evidence and decide the case based only on the balance
    of the evidence. If they are satisfied that the accused fabricated the alibi or
    exculpatory evidence as post-offence conduct, then they are entitled to use the
    finding of fabrication as a piece of evidence in determining guilt or
    innocence, that is, as circumstantial post-offence conduct evidence that must
    be weighed together with all the other evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court in <i>O’Connor</i> recognized at para. 38 that the distinction between disbelieving an alibi and
    finding deliberate fabrication is an extremely difficult concept. As a result,
    it is critical for the trial judge to clearly explain the difference between
    the two types of evidence and what evidence is capable of being independent
    evidence of fabrication. It is also essential for the trial judge to identify
    the evidence in the record that could constitute the independent evidence of
    fabrication.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            v)
    Application of the <i>O’Connor</i> principles to the appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in <i>O’Connor</i>,
    the trial judge failed to canvass the issue of the existence of independent
    evidence of fabrication at the admissibility stage. The accused’s exculpatory
    statement to police was therefore put before the jury by the Crown without any
    consideration of whether it was open to the jury to find that the statement was
    concocted. Although the Crown was entitled to qualify the statement as
    voluntary and <i>Charter</i>-compliant, the
    out-of-court statement could only be used for purposes of cross-examining the
    appellant, unless the trial judge was satisfied that there was sufficient
    independent evidence to support a finding that the statement was concocted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this record, there is little evidence that could be
    considered independent evidence of concoction. Crown counsel in his closing
    made much of the appellant’s memory of various details of the empty apartment
    where the crime occurred, suggesting that a person would not remember such
    details if all that occurred in the apartment was a sexual encounter of the
    nature described by the appellant.  However, the details recounted by the appellant were not proved to be
    inaccurate ones that could demonstrate a lie, and therefore are not the type of
    evidence referred to in <i>O’Connor</i> as
    being capable of providing independent evidence of fabrication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor can the circumstances of the interview with police
    be considered as any independent evidence of fabrication.  Unlike in <i>O’Connor</i>,
    where the police interview occurred before the accused was even a suspect, in
    this case, the police interviewed the appellant following his arrest, during
    which he was told that his semen was found in and around the deceased. Because
    the appellant was interviewed not as a mere witness but as the person charged
    with the crime, the circumstances of the interview cannot be considered as any
    independent evidence of fabrication. Thus, this is not a case like <i>R. v. Polimac</i>, 2010 ONCA 346 (CanLII),
    where the court was satisfied that the <i>O’Connor</i> criteria for independent evidence of fabrication were clearly met even though
    the trial judge did not directly consider the issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had the trial judge been asked to consider the issue of
    independent evidence of fabrication at the admissibility stage, a possible item
    of such evidence may have been the Midland conversation with Crystal. It would
    have been necessary to assess whether that evidence could reasonably support a
    finding that the appellant was asking Crystal to provide him with a false story
    about his whereabouts and, if so, whether that request could somehow constitute
    independent evidence of concoction in relation to his statement to police.  Because we are of the view that a new trial
    should be ordered, we refrain from expressing a conclusion on the independent
    evidence of concoction issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also did not consider at the
    admissibility stage whether the Crown could properly tender the statement, as
    it related to the appellant’s story about going to see Crystal at the Wesley
    Centre on the night of the murder, as evidence of a false alibi. The Crown’s
    position was that the appellant was trying to mislead police by expanding the
    time he was with Crystal by stating they argued “for over an hour” and through
    his story that he looked for Crystal inside the Wesley Centre for 20 minutes
    before finding her sitting outside.  According to the Crown, the video surveillance tape footage showed that
    the appellant was only at the Wesley Centre for 50 minutes in total, and that
    he was lying to the police about having gone into the Wesley Centre for 20
    minutes before finding Crystal outside.  The Crown’s false alibi position rested on these inaccuracies in the
    appellant’s description of his whereabouts on the night of the murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, even if the appellant lied about being with
    Crystal for “over an hour”, or about looking inside the Wesley Centre for
    Crystal for 20 minutes before finding her outside, he was not giving himself a
    complete alibi by providing this information. He did not try to suggest to
    police that he was with Crystal for a time period that would have made it
    impossible for him to commit the murder.  Indeed, on the Crown’s theory of the case, the murder may have happened
    after the appellant left Crystal.  Moreover, the video surveillance footage relied on by the Crown could
    not constitute independent evidence of fabrication, but would merely be
    evidence tending to show the falsity of these aspects of his statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the charge to the jury, the trial judge did not give
    any instruction on what evidence, if any, the jury could consider as
    independent evidence that the appellant’s exculpatory statement to the police
    following his arrest was fabricated. Nor was the jury told that there is a
    difference between disbelieving an exculpatory statement of the accused, in
    which case, that evidence is to be ignored, versus a finding of fabrication,
    which can permit the statement to be used to determine guilt or innocence. Nor
    was a <i>Parrington</i> charge given with
    respect to the appellant’s statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the trial judge gave the jury her brief summary of
    the Crown’s position, she referred to two things: the expert evidence as well
    as the inconsistencies in the appellant’s story in his conversations with
    Crystal and with the police “as demonstrative of Mr. Hall’s attempts to
    distance himself from the murder.” Rather than addressing the factual
    shortcomings of the Crown’s false alibi allegations and without giving the jury
    the law on false alibi or the use of fabricated exculpatory statements of the
    accused, the trial judge left the position of the Crown on fabrication with the
    jury to use without the clear guidance specified in <i>O’Connor</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These were very serious omissions in a case where the
    evidence was entirely circumstantial and where the Crown relied heavily on the
    allegation of fabrication as part of its case to the jury.  Defence counsel had objected to the trial
    judge’s characterization of the Midland conversation as post-offence conduct
    given its equivocal nature, but the trial judge’s charge did not adequately
    reflect this legitimate concern. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The trial judge
    was not asked by the parties to assess the admissibility of the appellant’s
    exculpatory out-of-court statement to the police for the purposes the Crown
    sought to make of it.  Her failure in
    this regard is thus understandable.  However, having admitted the statement, it was incumbent on the trial
    judge to give an instruction on the use of this statement that reflected the
    requirements set out by this court in <i>O’Connor</i>.
    Unlike in <i>Polimac</i>, it cannot be said
    that the trial judge fairly and fully explained to the jury how the appellant’s
    statement to the police could support the defence’s theory of the case: see <i>Polimac</i> at paras. 105-106<span
class=GramE>.  We</span> are thus of the
    view that the failure to give this instruction prejudiced the appellant’s right
    to a fair trial in the circumstances of this case.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]</span></span></span></a>    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>5.  Did the trial judge err in failing to
    instruct on post-offence conduct in relation to Barry Lane?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At defence counsel’s request, the trial judge ruled that
    the defence could point to Barry Lane as an alternate suspect for the
    commission of the crime. Both the Crown and the defence relied on Lane’s
    conduct following his discovery of the victim’s body. The Crown’s position was
    that he was co-operative with the police, which indicated innocence, while the
    defence pointed to all of the lies he told about his whereabouts and his
    interactions with various people that night, including the victim, as well as
    the blood on his shoe, the fact that he took off his shirt, and other conduct
    that could indicate that he was the perpetrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two related issues regarding the
    trial judge’s charge with respect to Lane. First, by not giving any instruction
    regarding Lane’s alleged inculpatory post-offence conduct and by only giving an
    instruction on the appellant’s post-offence conduct, the jury was left with an
    unbalanced picture of the post-offence conduct evidence that favoured the
    Crown’s case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge failed to instruct the jury
    that Lane’s post-offence conduct could be used, in the context of weighing all
    of the evidence, in determining whether the jury had a reasonable doubt that
    the appellant was the killer. According to the appellant, the trial judge added
    to this error in her brief summary of the positions of the Crown and defence by
    equating the Crown’s theory that the appellant was attempting “to distance
    himself from the murder” with the defence theory that Lane’s post-offence
    conduct reflected his attempt to distance himself from the murder. The trial
    judge ought instead to have explained to the jury that the appellant’s conduct
    could be circumstantial evidence used to determine guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt, whereas Lane’s conduct was circumstantial evidence that could be used to
    find a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, the Crown points to the fact that the
    issue of Lane as the alternative suspect was squarely before the jury, that
    defence counsel did not request this instruction at trial, and that any such
    instruction would have required the judge to outline in detail the aspects of
    Lane’s conduct that the Crown said showed his innocence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Crown that the trial judge did not
    err by not giving a post-offence conduct charge in regard to Lane’s conduct as
    an alternate suspect for the murder. However, we agree with the appellant that
    the jury was left with no legal context in which to analyze Lane’s conduct
    after the deceased was discovered, in contrast to the post-offence conduct
    instruction in relation to the appellant’s statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was required from the trial judge was an
    instruction that if the evidence of Lane’s post-offence conduct left the jury
    with a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the killer then they must
    acquit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did the <i>W<span
class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> instruction by the trial judge assist in
    minimizing the magnitude of the error, because the <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction related specifically to what the trial judge
    referred to as the “testimony” of the appellant and not to any other evidence
    that was favourable to him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, other than the instructions regarding the
    need for proof beyond a reasonable doubt, there was no instruction that could
    assist the jury with the concept that if the evidence regarding whether Lane
    was the perpetrator left them with a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s
    guilt, they should acquit.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>V.  Conclusion </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a case for the application of the proviso.
    Considering that the evidence against the appellant was wholly circumstantial,
    we cannot say that absent the errors in the jury charge, the verdict would
    inevitably have been the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, based on the trial judge’s errors in her
    articulation of the defence position and in her treatment of the post-offence
    conduct evidence of both the appellant and Lane, we would allow the appeal, set
    aside the verdict and order a new trial.</p>
