    access and copy exhibits filed at a preliminary inquiry.  In October 2007, Ashley Smith died in custody
    at the Grand Valley Institution for Women.  Four correctional officers were charged with criminal negligence causing
    death.  Those charges proceeded to a
    preliminary inquiry where certain exhibits were introduced into evidence.  The exhibits included video recordings, one
    of which captured the actual circumstances of Ashley Smith's death.  Part way through the preliminary inquiry, the
    Crown decided not to proceed with the charges and the four correctional
    officers were discharged.  A coroner's
    warrant was subsequently issued for the seizure of all documents related to
    Ashley Smith's death including the preliminary inquiry exhibits.</span></p>

    decided to produce an investigative documentary on Ashley Smith’s tragic life.  CBC sought access to and copies of the
    preliminary inquiry exhibits.  The preliminary
    inquiry judge refused CBC’s request on the ground that he should not interfere
    with the process of the coroner's inquest.  The application judge granted certiorari to
    review that order and held that CBC was entitled to access the exhibits, but he
    limited CBC’s rights in certain respects.  In particular, he held that CBC was entitled to view and copy only those
    portions of the video evidence that were actually played at the preliminary inquiry,
    and that CBC was entitled to view but not copy the portion of the video that
    was played showing Ashley Smith’s death.</span></p>

    serving a six-year sentence at the Grand Valley Institution for Women in
    Kitchener. On October 19, 2007, while under observation in an isolation cell,
    she strangled herself with a strip of cloth.  Four correctional officers employed by CSC
    were charged with criminal negligence causing death.  Those charges proceeded to a preliminary
    inquiry in November 2008.  A publication
    ban was imposed pursuant to s. 539 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  The exhibits entered into
    evidence included photographs, documents and audio and video recordings
    relating to CSC’s management of Ashley Smith.  Although these recordings were marked as
    exhibits in their entirety, only portions were actually played in open court.  The portion of one of the video recordings
    showing the actual circumstances of Ashley Smith’s death was played in open court.</span></p>

    publication ban expired pursuant to s. 539(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The exhibits were returned to the
    investigating police force, the Waterloo Region Police Service (“WRPS”), and
    then given to the Office of the Chief Coroner (“OCC”) pursuant to a coroner's
    warrant for the purpose of a coroner's inquest into Ashley Smith's death.</span></p>

    the open court principle allows the public and the media to attend court and to

    publish or broadcast the copies. </span></p>

    judge refused to allow a media request to copy an exhibit, but he did so
    because he was satisfied (at para. 86) that “to permit dissemination to

    dealt with a mid-trial request to copy an exhibit. While there are certainly

    cases that permit the media to make copies of exhibits.  In <i>R. v.

    been introduced at a preliminary inquiry.  The accused pleaded guilty at trial and
    received a conditional sentence.  The
    Crown successfully appealed the sentence and a custodial term was imposed.  At that point, the media sought access to the
    video recording of the statement and the right to make a copy for purposes of
    broadcast.  The Manitoba Court of Appeal
    held at para. 47 that the media were “entitled to have access to and copy the

    restriction in a judicial proceeding, the entire exhibit becomes a part of the
    record in the case.  While a party may
    choose to read or play only portions of the exhibit in open court, the trier of
    fact, whether judge or jury, is not limited to considering only those portions
    when deciding the case.  A party who
    introduces an exhibit without restriction cannot limit the attention of the
    trier of fact to only portions of the exhibit that favour that party and that
    the party chooses to read out or play in open court. </span></p>

    played or read out in open court. When Dickson J. articulated and applied the
    open court principle to accord a journalist access to an affidavit filed in
    support of a search warrant application in <i>MacIntrye</i>,
    he was plainly confronted with material that had not been read out in open
    court.  Yet he did not hesitate to order
    access.  Absent some countervailing
    consideration sufficient to satisfy the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test, the open court principle and the media’s right of access to judicial
    proceedings must extend to anything that has been made part of the record,
    subject to any specific order to the contrary.</span></p>

    evidence depicting in explicit detail the sexual assaults and rapes of four
    young girls, three of who were murder victims.  LeSage A.C.J.O.C. applied the <i>Dagenais</i> test and, after a careful
    review of the evidence and the competing <i>Charter</i> arguments, concluded that the case for restricting access had been made out.  He ruled that when the evidence was played, it
    should be visible only to the judge, the jury, counsel, the accused and to the
    extent necessary, court staff. No limit was imposed on the access to the audio
    portion of the exhibit. LeSage A.C.J.O.C. stated at para. 121 that the evidence
    established that “the harm that flows from the public display of this videotape
    evidence far exceeds any benefit that will flow from the public exposure of
    sexual assault and child pornography.”  LeSage
    A.C.J.O.C. found, again at para. 121, that the families of the victims would </span></p>
