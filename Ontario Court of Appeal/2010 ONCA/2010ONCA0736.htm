  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from her convictions for
    possession and trafficking arising from the operation of a marijuana
    cultivation operation that the police discovered in the basement of her house
    when responding to a 911 call. The appellant’s position was that she had rented
    the basement to a tenant and had no knowledge that he was using it to cultivate
    marijuana.  In support of this position,
    appellant’s counsel filed as exhibits a <span class=GramE>purported</span> tenancy agreement with a Mr. Feng and a Notice of Hearing of eviction.  The appellant did not testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s primary ground of appeal is that her
    trial counsel (not appellate counsel) provided her with ineffective
    assistance.  She alleges that the
    “decision [that she not] testify was in effect... made by counsel and not by
    the appellant, and thus a miscarriage of justice resulted therefrom.” In the
    alternative, the appellant argues that trial counsel’s advice not to testify
    amounted to incompetence, as did his failure to call certain evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s contentions on appeal must be
    considered in the context of the Crown’s case at the time of trial.  At trial, the Crown led evidence that the
    police located the marijuana operation when they were attending at the
    appellant’s house in the early hours of December 31, 2008 in response to a 911
    call placed by the appellant’s seventeen-year-old daughter.  The daughter, who was very frightened,
    reported that someone was attempting to force entry into the house.  At some point during the call, the daughter
    gave the telephone to the appellant.  The
    appellant spoke little English.  The call
    was terminated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police proceeded to the house. They observed
    shattered glass on the front porch, a broken window in the front door and a
    damaged doorframe. As soon as they entered, they noted an overwhelming odour of
    marijuana that seemed to emanate from the locked basement.  The door to the basement was located in the
    main floor hallway. After securing the main and upper floors of the house, the police
    asked the appellant for a key to the basement. The appellant produced the key
    from the top of her refrigerator and unlocked the basement door. Upon entry the
    police found that the basement contained recently harvested marijuana and
    associated paraphernalia such as foil over the windows and doors, timers,
    hydroponic equipment, lights, a fan, pots of soil, marijuana stalks and leaves
    in numerous garbage bags and packaged marijuana.  There was no indication of occupation of the
    basement by a residential tenant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel defended on the basis of reasonable doubt
    pointing to the evidence of the tenancy agreement and the eviction notice as
    well as the absence of a direct connection between the appellant and the
    basement operation. However, the trial judge convicted the appellant concluding
    that she had knowledge and control of and was linked to the production of the
    marijuana for the purposes of trafficking.  She cited the appellant’s access to the basement, the absence of “signs
    that the basement was occupied by persons”, and the overwhelming odour of
    marijuana.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Legal Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicable legal principles are not in
    dispute.  An accused represented by
    counsel is entitled to effective representation.  An appeal court will receive fresh evidence
    concerning an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel under s. 683(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.   If an appellant establishes ineffective
    representation that resulted in a miscarriage of justice, his or her conviction
    will be quashed.   See <i><span style='line-height:200%;'>R. v. Joanisse</span></i><span
style='line-height:200%;'> <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>(1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35</span> at 43-44, 56-58 (Ont. C.A.), leave
    to appeal to S.C.C. refused, <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>[1996] S.C.C.A. No. 347</span>; <i>R.
    v. Archer</i> (2005) O.J. No. 4348 (Ont. C.A.) at 118.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To succeed in a claim of ineffective assistance of
    counsel, an appellant must establish the three components described by Doherty
    J.A. at paras. 119 and 120 of <i>Archer</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First,
    where the claim is based on contested facts, the appellant must establish the
    material facts on the balance of probabilities. Second, the appellant must
    demonstrate that counsel’s acts or omissions amounted to incompetence.
    Incompetence is measured against a reasonableness standard. That assessment is
    made having regard to the circumstances as they existed when the impugned acts
    or omissions occurred. Hindsight plays no role in the assessment. Allegations
    of incompetent representation must be closely scrutinized. Many decisions made
    by counsel at trial will come to be seen as erroneous in the cold light of a
    conviction. The reasonableness analysis must proceed upon a “strong presumption
    that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional
    assistance”: <i>R. v. G.D.B.</i> <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>(2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 289</span> at 298 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Third, the
    appellant must demonstrate that counsel’s ineffective representation caused a
    miscarriage of justice. A miscarriage of justice occurs if the appellate court
    is satisfied that counsel’s ineffective representation undermined the
    appearance of the fairness of the trial, or the reliability of the verdict. A
    verdict is rendered unreliable where the appellant demonstrates that had
    counsel performed in a competent fashion, there is a reasonable possibility
    that the verdict could have been different: <i>G.D.B.</i>,
    supra, at pp. 298-99; <i>Joanisse</i>,
    supra, at pp. 62-64.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>G.D.B</i>., at
    p. 298, Major J. suggested that a court should first decide whether the alleged
    incompetence of counsel resulted in a miscarriage of justice because, in the
    absence of a miscarriage of justice, it would be unnecessary to consider the
    other two elements that deal with counsel’s performance.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I           Alleged
    failure to advise</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Crown concedes that if trial counsel
    failed to advise the appellant of her right to testify, or effectively made the
    decision for her, the appellant would have suffered a miscarriage of justice.  He refers to para. 139 of <i>Archer</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the
    appellant can show that it was trial counsel and not the appellant who decided
    that the appellant would not testify, and that the appellant would have
    testified had he understood that it was his decision, it seems to me that it
    must be accepted that his testimony could have affected the result, thereby
    establishing that a miscarriage of justice occurred: see <i>R. v. Moore</i> <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>(2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 343</span> at 371 (Sask. C.A.). The crucial question
    becomes - who made the decision?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as in <i>Archer</i>,
    the inquiry focused on the question of whether the appellant has established
    that trial counsel failed to effectively advise her of her right to
    testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s allegation relies largely on attacking
    the competence and reliability of the interpreter provided by trial
    counsel.  She argues that the interpreter
    did not properly, accurately or fully translate between English and
    Mandarin.  She claims that the
    interpreter had a strong Cantonese accent so that she “could understand some
    but not all of his translations” and she was unsure that he understood her
    completely.  She stated that she had only
    limited schooling in China and did not understand that evidence had to come
    from witnesses.  Instead, she understood
    from the interpreter that her lawyer would speak on her behalf at the
    trial.  Further, she claims trial counsel
    never spoke to her about testifying at trial and if he had done so she would
    have exercised her right to testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel filed affidavit evidence that the
    interpreter about whom the appellant complains was accredited by the court as a
    Mandarin/Cantonese interpreter as well as by the Immigration and Refugee Board
    as a Mandarin interpreter.  Trial counsel
    had used the interpreter’s services for Mandarin and Cantonese clients since
    2002 without any complaint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel retained the interpreter for his meetings
    with the appellant throughout the year preceding trial.  During the year, there were five pre-trial
    court appearances.  Trial counsel stated
    that neither the appellant nor her former husband, who was present at certain
    meetings, made any complaint or raised any difficulty about the interpreter’s
    work.  Furthermore, trial counsel spoke
    with the appellant’s daughter in English when preparing her for trial.  At no time did the daughter communicate any
    complaints or concerns that her mother had concerning the interpreter’s
    services.  Moreover, the appellant
    appeared to comprehend the interpreter fully since she produced to her lawyer
    the documentary evidence that he requested through the interpreter during their
    meetings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellant denied any discussion about whether
    she should exercise her right to testify, trial counsel gave specifics about
    the discussion he says took place and the hurdles he told the appellant she
    would face in cross-examination. He attested to his assessment of the Crown’s
    case and his concern that any benefits from the appellant’s testimony would be
    significantly outweighed by its potential prejudice.  He said that the appellant responded to his
    advice that she not testify in Mandarin. Her response was translated by the
    interpreter: “better if I don’t”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I assess the appellant’s evidence cognizant of her
    motive to conceive or reconstruct a scenario in her mind that would enable her
    to secure a retrial and mindful not to employ hindsight in assessing the
    discussion between counsel and client and any decision taken at the time of
    trial. I approach trial counsel’s evidence with the presumption that he
    appreciated the basic principle that an accused has the right to testify and
    that the decision whether to do so must be made by the accused and not by
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying this approach, the appellant has failed to
    establish the material facts necessary to support her allegation of ineffective
    assistance of counsel on the balance of probabilities.  Her evidence is not consistent with the
    absence of any complaint about the interpreter’s translation, her compliance
    with counsel’s production requests made through the interpreter, her failure to
    produce any detail concerning the purported tenant, and counsel’s knowledge and
    appreciation of his obligation to canvass the appellant’s right to testify. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In coming to this conclusion, I reject the appellant’s
    argument that the respondent had an onus to file an affidavit by the
    interpreter.  Trial counsel’s critical
    evidence was that he had used this accredited interpreter without complaint for
    years and he gave evidence of a specific discussion with the appellant about
    her right to testify and her response, “better if I don’t”. The appellant did
    not shake this critical evidence on cross-examination.  The interpreter was equally available to her
    if she considered his evidence would benefit her position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II
            <span class=GramE>Other</span> allegations of ineffective assistance</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to the appellant’s alternate allegation of
    ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel’s advice that she not
    testify at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the appellant’s position that the Crown’s case
    was so compelling that she either had to testify or face inevitable
    conviction.  In those circumstances, she
    argues that trial counsel displayed incompetence in advising her not to
    testify. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel testified that he advised the appellant
    against testifying at trial for a number of reasons.  First, in his view, the appellant’s best
    opportunity for an acquittal was based on raising a reasonable doubt about the
    Crown’s largely circumstantial case. Trial counsel intended to do so by relying
    on the absence of any expert witness to establish possession for the purpose of
    trafficking. He also intended to disassociate the appellant from the operation
    by pointing to the absence of any evidence that the appellant was engaged in
    the cultivation of the marijuana, the evidence of a fingerprint on a marijuana
    grow chart that did not belong to the appellant, and the evidence of tenant
    occupation of the basement through the rental agreement and subsequent eviction
    notice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, trial counsel was concerned that the
    appellant’s evidence would serve overall to improve the Crown’s case. Those
    concerns arose from three important factors. First, the appellant was unable to
    provide any particulars about the purported tenant.  Indeed, even in her fresh evidence on appeal
    the appellant has not offered any particulars about the alleged tenant.  Since the gist of the appellant’s defence was
    that the marijuana operation belonged to her tenant and not to her it was important,
    if she decided to testify, that she be in a position to provide some detail to
    bring the purported tenant to life.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, if the appellant testified, she would be
    questioned about her means of maintaining the property. Her bank statements
    showed very significant amounts of money flowed into her bank account over the
    relevant time. The appellant’s explanation to her counsel, which was that
    friends gave her money that was later repaid by her brother, was improbable and
    was not substantiated by the documentary evidence or the evidence of other
    proposed witnesses. The absence of a solid explanation about how she could
    maintain the property with her limited level of income could lead to an
    inference that she did so through the marijuana operation, the proceeds of
    which were deposited in her account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant admitted to trial counsel that
    she had committed fraud in obtaining the mortgage needed to purchase the
    property. She did so by providing the mortgagee with forged documents that purported
    to establish that she was earning $65,000 in employment income.  In the trial lawyer’s view, this fraud may
    have been elicited by the Crown in evidence and would have been admissible as
    relevant to the appellant’s motive in buying the house and maintaining payments
    on the mortgage. Admission of this evidence could lead to the inference that
    the appellant bought the property for the purpose for which it was used;
    namely, as a marijuana cultivation operation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if trial counsel erred in his view of the extent
    of the prejudice posed by the mortgage fraud evidence, including its effect on
    a possible subsequent fraud charge - and the record is by no means clear that
    he did so - any such error did not affect either trial counsel’s recommendation
    or the appellant’s decision not to testify.  In any event, the mortgage fraud was but one of many concerns trial
    counsel had in recommending that the appellant not testify and her decision
    that it was “better” if she did not do so. That decision made sense. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that she had other essential
    evidence that trial counsel ignored in advising her not to testify.  For example, the appellant says that trial
    counsel should have taken into account the importance of establishing that she
    was absent from the house for all but the last six weeks before the incident as
    well as for the entire week immediately preceding the discovery of the
    operation.  The appellant says she also
    would have given evidence that the only time she noticed a distinctive odour (that
    she could not identify) was the night before the 911 call. However, evidence
    about the appellant’s absences from the house would have been of marginal
    benefit given that the cultivation operation appeared to have been in existence
    for some time, including for the several weeks when the appellant acknowledged
    she was residing in the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also says that trial counsel failed to
    appreciate, among other things, that, if called as a witness, she would have
    testified that she asked her daughter to place the 911 call and only terminated
    it because she thought the dispatcher had already broken the connection. The
    appellant argues that her evidence that she initiated the 911 call would have
    suggested that she did not know about the operation in the basement.  Trial counsel denies that this information
    was given to him before trial. In any event, the appellant’s explanation is
    belied by the emergency circumstances in which the 911 call was made. When
    someone was breaking windows with the apparent intent of entering the house at
    three o’clock in the morning the reasonable inference is that the appellant’s
    primary concern would have been the safety of herself and her young daughter
    and not the contents of the locked basement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellant’s proposed additional
    evidence, particularly when considered in light of the case against her, and
    when balanced against the negative impact of her other evidence, would not have
    led competent counsel to advise the appellant to testify at trial. Accordingly,
    the appellant has failed to establish that counsel’s advice amounted to
    ineffective assistance of counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For similar reasons, I do not accept the appellant’s
    argument that trial counsel’s decision not to call the daughter as a witness in
    any way demonstrated a lack of competence. Counsel explained his similar
    concerns about the daughter’s proposed evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I give no weight to the appellant’s argument
    that trial counsel failed to call other pertinent evidence, such as the airline
    ticket demonstrating her travels. This evidence really amounts to the same
    issue about whether trial counsel should have advised the appellant to testify.
    Similarly, the appellant argues trial counsel was incompetent in filing
    materials evidencing her ownership of the home. However, various pieces of
    evidence pointed to the appellant’s ownership of the home, including her
    admission of this fact to the police, her presence in the home and the
    purported tenancy agreement and eviction notice in which she was listed as the
    owner and which was essential to her defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I conclude by observing that the argument in
    this case would have been substantially narrowed had the trial counsel followed
    the practice he implemented in other cases of obtaining a signed (and in this
    case interpreted) direction from the appellant that she chose not to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  In doing so, I observe that the appellant did
    not pursue her appeal regarding sentence.  </p>
