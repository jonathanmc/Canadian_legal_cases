  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the summary judgment awarded
    against him.  He entered into an
    agreement to purchase real estate property but failed to close the transaction.
     The vendor, the respondent, brought an
    action against him for damages.  The
    motion judge granted summary judgment to the vendor and awarded him damages of
    $282,476.09 and costs of $14,063.44 on a substantial indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant takes the position that the
    reason he refused to close the transaction was his discovery that property
    nearby had been or was used as a landfill site.  His solicitor’s search of title revealed certificates filed by the
    Ministry of Environment, but arrangements to remove these had been made by the
    closing date.  The appellant says that
    the law places a duty on the vendor of residential property to disclose to
    prospective purchasers any health and safety hazards the property poses.  In this case, the vendor did not disclose the
    existence of the landfill site.  The
    appellant submits that the motion judge should have refused summary judgment
    because whether the landfill site posed a risk to health and safety was a
    genuine issue for trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant recognizes that he did not place before
    the court any evidence to show that the landfill site posed a health risk.  However, he submits the burden was on the vendor
    to file evidence to establish that it did not pose a health risk.  This is because, he says, the vendor, as the
    moving party, bore the initial burden of showing there is no genuine issue for
    trial.  He relied on the Supreme Court of
    Canada decision, <span class=SpellE><i>Papaschase</i></span><i> Indian Band No. 136 v Canada (A.G.)</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 372, for the proposition that each side to a summary judgment
    motion, not just the respondent, must put its best foot forward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is correct that the vendor, as the moving
    party, bore the legal or persuasive burden to satisfy the court that there is
    no genuine issue for trial. The vendor accomplished that by affidavit evidence before
    the court that was sufficient to establish, <i>prima
    facie</i>, that the real reason the appellant failed to close the transaction
    was his inability to arrange the necessary financing.  In fact, para. 26 of the appellant’s
    statement of defence <span class=GramE>constitutes</span> an admission that this
    is so.  In para. 26, the appellant
    pleaded that notwithstanding the certificates that were on title he was still
    willing to complete the purchase when he obtained the necessary funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the vendor established financing was the reason
    the appellant failed to close the transaction, the evidentiary burden was on
    the appellant to lead evidence to show the landfill site raised a genuine issue
    for trial.  He filed evidence that he
    refused to close the transaction because of his discovery of the nearby
    landfill site, but failed to lead any evidence that it posed a health and
    safety risk.  Absent such evidence, it
    could not be said that the existence of the landfill site raised a genuine
    issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the motion judge’s conclusion that
    he had not raised a genuine issue for trial.  The appeal of the judgment granted on the summary judgment motion is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sought leave to appeal the motion judge’s
    costs order.  We grant leave to appeal
    and allow the appeal for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the motion judge seems to have proceeded on the
    erroneous understanding “that on a successful motion for summary judgment, full
    indemnity costs are warranted”. She made no finding that the appellant acted
    unreasonably in responding to the motion or in bad faith for the purpose of
    delay, so rule 20.06 had no application.  Second, the motion judge did not allow the appellant the opportunity of
    making any submissions before she imposed costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s costs order is set aside and replaced
    with an order of costs on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $7,500 all
    inclusive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Though the results are mixed, the respondent has
    achieved greater success.  We fix costs
    in favour of the respondent on a partial indemnity scale in the amount of
    $5000.00 all inclusive.<a name="_GoBack"></a> </p>
