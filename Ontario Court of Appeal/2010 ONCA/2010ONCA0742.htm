style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On June 14, 2008, Bradley Swinkels was charged
    with the offence of disturbing the peace through the use of obscene language
    pursuant to s. 175(1)(a)(i) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  On March 5, 2009 he was
    convicted of the offence as charged in the Ontario Court of Justice and
    subsequently sentenced to three days in custody.  The reasons of the trial judge are brief. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Swinkels’ summary conviction appeal was
    heard in the Superior Court of Justice on October 26, 2009 and, in even briefer
    reasons, the appeal judge dismissed the appeal.  On November 19, 2009 Mr. Swinkels filed an application for leave to appeal
    to this court pursuant to s. 839 and s. 688(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The leave to
    appeal application and appeal were in writing.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The circumstances that gave rise to Mr. Swinkels
    being charged and subsequently convicted of disturbing the peace are not
    unusual.  The circumstances certainly
    appear to have been familiar to both the trial judge and the police officers
    involved.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the early morning hours of Saturday, June 14,
    2008, constables Paine and Kukolj were patrolling downtown London, Ontario just
    as the bars were closing.  While driving
    they heard someone yell obscenities from within a large crowd of people outside
    a bar.  The number of people was
    estimated at between 15 and 20. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The officers pulled over to investigate, and as
    they exited their vehicle Mr. Swinkels came quickly towards Constable Paine
    yelling further obscenities.  Both of Mr.
    Swinkels’ arms were straight out and his middle fingers were up.  Constable Paine believed that Mr. Swinkels
    was about to assault or <span class=GramE>grab</span> him, so he grabbed Mr.
    Swinkels’ shirt, pulled him to the ground, and arrested him for causing a
    disturbance.</p>
  <h2><i>The trial judge</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge began his analysis of this case
    by suggesting that the proper interpretation of the law is found in <i>R. v. Lohnes</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 167.  He did so
    with these comments:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It seems to me defence counsel’s reference to <i>R. v. Lohnes </i>is a broader interpretation
    of the law; that an external manifested disturbance is necessary.  Remarkably, I find that there was one here, caused
    by her client.  For reasons I hope to
    expand upon, I am satisfied there was a disturbance and that several members of
    the public were disturbed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
class=bold0><span style='color:black'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=bold0><span style='color:
black'>The trial judge held that on all the evidence, and “in light of the
    dicta of the Supreme Court of Canada … in <i>Lohnes</i>”,
    Mr. Swinkels “caused an external manifested disturbance that, because of the
    obscenity associated with it, the case has been proved beyond a reasonable
    doubt.”  I would note here that <i>Lohnes</i> is the correct authority for the
    trial judge to have relied upon.</span></span></p>
  <h2><span class=bold0><i>The summary conviction appeal judge</i></span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
class=verdana>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=verdana>The appeal judge found that the trial judge had committed &ldquo;no error of fact or law&rdquo; and dismissed the appeal.  Her reasons for this conclusion consist of two brief paragraphs in a five paragraph decision: paragraph one simply recognized that this was a summary conviction appeal; paragraph two thanked counsel for their &ldquo;very able submissions&rdquo;; and paragraph five stated that &ldquo;the appeal is dismissed.&rdquo;  Her analysis in the remaining two paragraphs is very brief:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=verdana>[3]       In particular, I reviewed the evidence of P.C. Jonathon Paine
    (p. 22, lines 15-32).  The officer
    clearly testified that a large group of people had congregated on the west side
    of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Richmond Street near the entrance of
    Barney’s patio.  He further testified
    that it was then he heard a male’s voice (now known to be the Appellant) coming
    from inside the group of about 15 or 20 people yelling obscenities.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=verdana>[4]       In conclusion, I find that the Honourable Justice E.J. McGrath
    correctly concluded that the Appellant had disturbed the public peace, and
    accordingly convicted him. </span></p>
  <h2><span class=bold0><i>The offence</i></span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
class=bold0>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>Mr. Swinkels was charged with
    causing a public disturbance by using obscene language, contrary to s.
    175(1)(a)(i) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It reads:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=noarticlepara1><span style='color:black;
font-weight:normal;'>175.</span></span> (1) Every one
    who (a) not being in a
    dwelling-house, causes a disturbance in or near a public place, (i) by
    fighting, screaming, shouting, swearing, singing or using insulting or obscene
    language … is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='color:black;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0><span style='color:black'>The <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> for
    this offence has two components.  First,
    the accused must have engaged in one of the enumerated acts, which include
    “screaming, shouting, swearing, or using insulting or obscene language.”  Second, the accused’s actions must have
    caused </span></span><span style='color:black;'>“an
    externally manifested disturbance of the public peace, in the sense of
    interference with the ordinary and customary use of the premises by the
    public”: </span><i><span style='color:black'>Lohnes</span></i><span
style='color:black'>,</span><span style='color:black;'> at</span><span style='color:black'> p. 181.  Or, as the court put it another way, the test would be satisfied if actions
    by an accused involved<span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'> “violent noise or
    confusion disrupting the tranquillity of those using the area in question”: p.
    179. </span></span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
class=bold0><span style='color:black;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style='color:black'>Mr. Swinkels </span><span
class=bold0><span style='color:black;'>concedes that
    the Crown proved the first element beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, he argues that the Crown failed to
    prove that his conduct resulted in an “externally manifested disturbance”.  He says that the evidence fails to prove that
    his actions </span></span><span style='color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>interfered
    with the ordinary and customary use by the public of the place in question. He
    notes further that what is the ordinary and customary use of public space is
    dependent in part on the time and way in which the place is used. I agree.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the following reasons, I grant leave to appeal.  I conclude that the trial judge was in error in applying the test required to satisfy the offence Mr. Swinkels was convicted of.  In turn, the appeal judge was in error when she upheld the decision and dismissed Mr. Swinkels&rsquo; appeal.  Furthermore, the remedy I propose is that the conviction be set aside and an acquittal entered.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2><i>The leave application</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Swinkels’ appeal is from the decision of the
    summary conviction appeal court and not the trial decision.  Under s. 839 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, in order to obtain leave to appeal Mr. Swinkels must
    demonstrate some exceptional circumstances justifying a further appeal to this
    court.  This is decided by an examination
    of two factors: (1) the significance of the legal issue raised to the general
    administration of justice, and (2) the merits of the proposed appeal: <i>R. v. R. (R.)</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 641,
    at para. 32 (Ont. C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Swinkels does not specifically address the
    issue of leave to appeal in his written materials; rather, he goes directly to
    the grounds of appeal.  Essentially, he
    forcefully argues that there was no evidence of a “disturbance” to satisfy the
    offence and that both the trial judge and appeal judge erred in finding that
    the offence had been proven.  Further,
    Mr. Swinkels contends that both judges applied the wrong test in the
    interpretation of s. 175(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)(i).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The essence of Mr. Swinkels’ application and
    appeal is a request that this court reconsider – for the third time – his case,
    which involves a settled area of law.  Indeed, the trial judge expressly adverted to, and believed he had
    applied, the correct legal test.  The
    appeal judge, in turn, simply agreed with the trial judge’s conclusion.  In the result, Mr. Swinkels’ case does not
    involve issues that go beyond the four corners of his case and there is no
    general significance of the legal issue raised to the general administration of
    justice.  Mr. Swinkels’ application for
    leave to appeal, when considered under the first factor, therefore, must
    fail.  However, I do find that there are
    strong merits to the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
class=bold0>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=verdana>In para. 37 of <i>R. (R.)</i> this court holds that: “where
    the merits appear very strong, leave to </span><a name="ORIGHIT_132"></a><a
name="HIT_132"></a><span class=hit>appeal</span><span class=verdana> may be
    granted even if the issues have no general importance, especially if the
    convictions in issue are serious and the applicant is facing a significant
    deprivation of his or her liberty.”  I
    think that principle applies in this case because, while t</span><span
class=bold0>he legal issues involved are settled, they were misapprehended by
    both the trial and summary conviction appeal judges.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>Accordingly, I believe leave
    to appeal should be granted, even though Mr. Swinkels is not facing a significant
    deprivation of his liberty.</span></p>
  <h2><span class=bold0><i>The appeal</i></span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>Generally speaking, the trial jurisprudence has held that shouting
    obscenities at police officers is not a disturbance in and of itself: see for
    example, </span><i>R. v. Wolgram,</i> (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 536 (B.C.S.C.)<span
class=bold0>; </span><i>R.
    v. Peters,</i> (1982), 65
    C.C.C. (2d) 83 (B.C.C.A.).  <span
class=verdana>In a </span><span
lang=EN-US>recent Ontario
    case, <i>R. v. Osbourne,</i></span><span
class=ssl2><span lang=EN-US> </span>2008 ONCJ 134,</span><span lang=EN-US> <span class=GramE>two</span> police officers questioned two individuals by the roadside.  The defendant, Osbourne, refused to answer
    the officers’ questions, shouted abuse at them, and walked away.  The following reasons of the trial judge at
    paras. 21 and 22 in <i>Osbourne</i> provide some
    helpful guidance:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he law is clear that yelling and swearing in a
    public place is not in itself a criminal offence.  Equally, the existence of emotional
    disturbance, such as Constable Correa’s belief that the defendant’s language
    was vulgar, aggressive and inappropriate, is insufficient to establish a
    disturbance within section 175(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I accept that by the time of Mr. Osbourne’s arrest a
    crowd of between 10 and 15 people had gathered outside of the strip plaza.  Some of these people were voicing anti-police
    sentiments.  Yet, based on the evidence
    of Constable Correa, I find that people did not begin to come out of the plaza
    and do more than briefly observe the situation until after the defendant had
    been unlawfully detained and cautioned for causing a disturbance when there was
    no disruption of the public peace.  But
    for the actions of the police in disregarding his rights, Mr. Osbourne would
    not have been yelling and swearing.  I
    find that any disturbance of the public was attributable to the conduct of the
    police. </p>

    obscenities at the police; the degree of peace expected was that of a large
    crowd gathering around a bar at closing time.  Constable Paine described the scene as “a normal bar type crowd”, and
    noted that the patio of the bar in question was always “packed full of very
    intoxicated” people.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
class=bold0>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>The trial judge in our appeal
    discussed the volatility of downtown London for bars around closing time,
    pointing out that a large percentage of the populace would have been
    intoxicated.   He then stated:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=bold0>And so it is in these
    circumstances that his action, in my opinion, and the vocal level of them with
    five to ten people gathering around, I do not find that they only gathered when
    the arrest was executed.  I find that
    they gathered around in response to his interaction before that.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence at trial was that the downtown core of London, Ontario, is extremely
    busy when the bars close.  Constable Kukolj
    testified that “there were a large number of people up and down Richmond
    Street.”  He also testified that there
    was “ongoing yelling” in the area.  Officer Paine testified that “[i]t was a warm summer’s night and the
    streets were just packed.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    “packed” and noisy streets of downtown London, just after the closing of the
    bars forms the context against which the disruptiveness of the appellant’s
    conduct must be measured. The “nature of the peace” that could be expected at
    this time and place is not the same as what one would expect in the library, or
    at the super market.  While Mr. Swinkels’
    behaviour was loud and raucous, its “disruptiveness” is dependent on the
    surroundings. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span class=bold0>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this
    context, and based on the evidence noted above, it appears unlikely that the
    presence of a crowd around or near Mr. Swinkels was a disturbance, as
    contemplated by <i>Lohnes</i>.  <span class=bold0>While it is not open
    for this court to interfere with the factual findings of the trial judge, I do
    take issue with his finding that Mr. Swinkels caused the crowd to gather.  I do so because this finding is at odds with
    the evidence of the police officers. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span class=bold0>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>First, Constable Paine’s
    testimony was that he saw “a really large group of people on the west side near
    the Barney’s entrance area” and that it was a “normal type bar crowd.”  The remainder of his testimony was that Mr.
    Swinkels was in the midst of that crowd when he shouted obscenities.  In fact, Constable Paine testified that Mr.
    Swinkels’ conduct did not cause a fight or upset the others around him.  This was because, in his words, the officers
    “dealt with the situation” <i>prior</i> to a
    disturbance arising. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span class=bold0>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>Second, while a crowd did
    gather around the officers, this happened only after the police engaged Mr.
    Swinkels and during the arrest.  Once the
    officers had stopped and exited their vehicle, Constable Kukolj testified that
    “[a]t that point Constable Paine was trying to <span class=GramE>effect</span> the arrest.  Given those circumstances,
    he clearly brought upon a large group of onlookers.” </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span class=bold0>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>I agree with the holding in <i>Osbourne</i> that a “public disturbance” requires
    more than a crowd observing – or even shouting anti-police sentiments at – police
    officers in the course of arrest.  In the
    words of the trial judge in that case, at para. 21:</span></p>
  <p class="Indent">[T]he law is clear that yelling and swearing
    in a public place is not in itself a criminal offence.  <span class=GramE>Equally, the existence of
    emotional disturbance, such as Constable Correa’s belief that the defendant’s
    language was vulgar.</span> <span class=GramE>aggressive</span> and
    inappropriate, is insufficient to establish a disturbance within section
    175(1)(a). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold0>This is consistent with the
    appellate jurisprudence: in order to satisfy the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of causing a public disturbance
    by using obscene language, the offending language must <i>cause</i> an externally manifested disturbance.  That is not the evidence here.  In the words of the only two witnesses, the
    “large group of onlookers” congregated only after the police had begun to <span
class=GramE>effect</span> the arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is little doubt that the police found
    themselves in a somewhat volatile situation.  However, based on their evidence at trial and the dearth of analysis
    provided by the trial judge and summary conviction appeal judge, I conclude
    that Mr. Swinkels was convicted erroneously.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge erred in his application of the Lohnes test.  The appeal judge in turn fell into error when she upheld the trial judge&rsquo;s decision, apparently relying on his misinterpretation and misapplication of the law.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h2><span class=bold0>DISPOSITION</span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence, I find, fails to show that <span
class=bold0>Mr. Swinkels’ actions caused </span>“an externally manifested disturbance of the public peace, in the sense
    of interference with the ordinary and customary use of the premises by the
    public”: <i>Lohnes</i>, at p. 181.   Given this, I would allow the appeal, set
    aside the conviction, and enter a verdict of acquittal.</p>

    principles set out in <i>R. v. Lohnes</i>,
    [1992] 1 S.C.R. 167.  He recognized that
    “an external manifested disturbance is necessary” to found the offence of
    causing a disturbance by using obscene language, contrary to s. 175(1)(a)(i) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  While acknowledging the right of the
    appellant to critique the police in a free and democratic society, the trial
    judge concluded in this case that the Crown had established such a manifested
    disturbance after considering the “location of [the appellant’s] remarks and
    the volume of his remarks” and putting them in the context of the case,
    including the nature, degree of intoxication and volatility of the crowd and
    the time and circumstances of the event. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Only two witnesses testified:  the two police officers at the scene.  Constable Paine testified that, prior to Mr.
    Swinkels’ arrest, the crowd was yelling and that Mr. Swinkels “wasn’t walking
    in the middle of the pack.  They had sort
    of fallen in behind him”.  He further
    testified that the appellant was “charging towards me as I exited the car” and
    one person in the crowd thrust a cell phone in Constable Paine’s face.  Constable Paine testified that the crowd was
    “surrounding us with sort of my back toward the van” and that Mr. Swinkels’
    utterances “seemed to fire up the crowd that they were all of a sudden turning
    on – towards Constable Kukolj and <span class=GramE>myself</span> for being
    involved in this”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague observes that, in
    cross-examination, Constable Paine acknowledged that the appellant did not
    upset the crowd to the extent of causing a fight and that the appellant was
    apprehended before the matter escalated further.  However, this acknowledgment did not detract
    from Constable Paine’s other evidence that the appellant’s conduct fired up the
    crowd.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge was also alive to the issue of
    whether the disturbance was caused by the appellant’s actions or resulted from
    the police action in arresting the appellant.  He concluded that the gathering was not in reaction to the appellant’s
    subsequent arrest.  He specifically
    stated “I do not find that they [the crowd] only gathered around when the
    arrest was executed.  I find that they
    gathered around in response to his [Mr. Swinkels’] interaction before
    that”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the trial judge’s reasons could have been
    more detailed, the trial judge must be taken to have been alive to the evidence
    in the context of this two-hour trial.  He was entitled to accept the evidence that supported the inference that
    Mr. Swinkels caused an “external manifested disturbance”.  In my view, since the trial judge properly
    identified and applied the law and made no reviewable error of fact, I would
    agree with the result reached by the summary conviction appeal judge and
    dismiss the appeal.  If I had been able
    to agree with LaForme J.A. that the trial judge erred by misinterpreting and
    misapplying the law, I would have ordered a new trial rather than entering an
    acquittal.  I would also not have granted
    leave to appeal.</p>
