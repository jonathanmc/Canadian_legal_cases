lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown requests leave to appeal the sentences
    imposed on the respondent for two firearms offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On</span> February 26, 2009, the respondent pleaded guilty to possession of a loaded
    restricted firearm and breach of a lifetime firearms prohibition order. After
    determining that a global sentence of about 8 years’ imprisonment would have
    been appropriate had the respondent gone to trial, Atwood J. sentenced the respondent
    to five years, six months’ imprisonment on the possession of a restricted firearm
    charge and to one year concurrent on the charge of possession of a firearm
    contrary to a prohibition order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In arriving at these sentences, the sentencing
    judge took account of the respondent’s guilty plea, his co-operation with the
    police on arrest and the fact that there was no indication the respondent was
    involved in other criminal activity when he was arrested. In the light of these
    factors, the sentencing judge concluded a six-year global sentence would be
    appropriate and gave the respondent six months’ credit on a two for one basis for
    pre-sentence custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    accept the Crown’s submission that the sentences imposed were demonstrably
    unfit and outside the range of what was appropriate for these offences and this
    offender. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
    the respondent had previously been convicted of possession of a firearm, five
    years’ imprisonment was the minimum sentence that could be imposed for the
    possession of a firearm offence. Moreover, given that this was the third
    occasion on which the respondent had been convicted of possession of a firearm
    and breach of a firearms prohibition, a global sentence of five years and six
    months’ imprisonment in addition to pre-sentence custody was simply not
    adequate to reflect the seriousness of these offences and the respondent’s
    incorrigibility as an offender.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offences arose from the respondent’s arrest on
    December 2, 2008 on an immigration warrant. He was arrested at gunpoint as he
    was entering a car. Upon his arrest, he revealed to the police that he had a
    .45 calibre semi-automatic Sig Sauer handgun secreted down the front of his
    pants. One .45 calibre round was in the chamber of the handgun and eight
    additional rounds were in the magazine. Police also found two rounds of .45
    calibre ammunition wrapped in a red bandana in the respondent’s rear pants
    pocket. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it may be true that the respondent was
    co-operative with the police on arrest and that there was no indication that he
    was involved in other criminal activity at the time, the more significant
    feature of these offences is that the respondent was moving about in the
    community with a fully loaded lethal weapon at the ready – and doing so despite
    court orders prohibiting him from possessing a firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of his arrest, the respondent was bound by
    two lifetime firearms prohibition orders. These orders arose from two prior
    sets of convictions for firearms offences. The persistent nature of the
    respondent’s serious misconduct and his presence in Canada despite a
    deportation order demonstrate his incorrigibility as an offender. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 12, 2003, the respondent was convicted of
    possession of a prohibited weapon with ammunition and breach of a five-year
    weapons prohibition. These offences were committed on August 18, 2002. Police
    stopped a motor vehicle in which the respondent was a passenger and noticed the
    wooden butt-end of a sawed off shotgun in the car. The shotgun was not loaded
    but police found two shotgun shells in the respondent’s pockets. The respondent
    was bound, at the time, <span class=GramE>by a five-year firearms</span> prohibition imposed on November 19, 1997, when the respondent was convicted of
    two counts of robbery. As the result of these convictions, a lifetime firearms
    prohibition was imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Less than 12 months later, on April 17, 2004, police
    found the respondent in possession of a fully loaded Glock 9 mm. semi-automatic
    firearm. As a result of this discovery, the respondent was convicted, on
    January 14, 2005, of possession of a restricted firearm with ammunition,
    careless use of a firearm, breach of a lifetime firearms prohibition order and
    failing to comply with a probation order and a second lifetime firearms
    prohibition order was imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, the respondent was in Canada illegally
    on the date of his arrest. He came to Canada from Jamaica as a child but was
    deported back to Jamaica on April&nbsp;11, 2006 following his 2005 convictions.
    Despite the deportation order, the respondent returned to Canada illegally, and,
    in a repeat of his past serious misconduct, he again carried a loaded lethal
    weapon in the face of a prohibition order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note as well that the respondent’s criminal record
    consists of 34 convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of this offence and this offender
    called out for an exemplary sentence to achieve the sentencing goals of
    denunciation and deterrence. Particularly in the light of Parliament’s decision
    to establish a mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment for a
    second or subsequent conviction for possessing a loaded restricted firearm, the
    global sentence imposed of five years and six months’ imprisonment in addition
    to pre-sentence custody was not adequate to meet those objectives. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent brought a fresh evidence application,
    but fresh evidence indicating that the respondent may now be pursuing his
    education and making efforts at rehabilitation in the penitentiary does not alter
    our conclusion. Handguns are an all too prevalent menace in the Greater Toronto
    Area. First and foremost, the sentences imposed for firearms offences must
    further the sentencing goals of denunciation, deterrence and protection of the
    public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentences of
    imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge are set aside and the following
    sentences of imprisonment are substituted:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(i)        <span
class=GramE>possession</span> of a loaded restricted firearm: 7 years, six
    months’ imprisonment less six months credit for pre-sentence custody for a
    total of 7 years imprisonment;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(ii)      <span
class=GramE>breach</span> of a firearms prohibition: 1 year imprisonment, to be
    served consecutively to the sentence for possession of a loaded restricted
    firearm.</p>
