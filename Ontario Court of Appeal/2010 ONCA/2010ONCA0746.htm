  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ginger (the pit bull) and Buddy (a shepherd/collie mix)
    became embroiled in a dog fight in a local park in Toronto on November 29,
    2005.  Although it is not clear from the
    record which dog initiated this canine fracas, the uncontested findings below
    are that Ginger bit Buddy repeatedly, inflicting serious wounds, and also that she
    bit Buddy’s owner, Jody MacDonald, more than once (although the extent of those
    injuries is not clear).  This conduct had
    serious consequences for Ginger.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two central factors underlie this appeal.  First, Ginger is a pit bull.  Secondly, the legislature had amended the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, <span
class=GramE>c</span>. D-16 earlier in 2005, before the fight, to introduce
    specific provisions dealing with pit bulls.  One such provision calls for the destruction of a pit bull found to have
    bitten another animal or a person.  Ginger is the target of that provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Huggins is Ginger’s owner, although at the time it
    was his mother who had taken the dog for a walk.  He was charged under the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i> with having failed to exercise reasonable
    precautions to prevent Ginger from biting or attacking another animal or a
    person or from behaving in a fashion posing a menace to the public safety.  At the same time, the Crown applied under s.
    4 of that Act for an order that Ginger be destroyed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Huggins was acquitted, but the Justice of the Peace
    ordered Ginger destroyed on the basis that the dog was a pit bull and that she had
    bitten another dog and a person.  The
    latter order was appealed to Hogan J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, who set it
    aside.  On June 17, 2009, Juriansz J.A.
    granted leave to appeal from the order of Hogan J. on the following question of
    law:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>  <span class=GramE>Whether the appeal judge
    erred in law in interpreting s. 4(8) of the <i>Dog
    Owners’ Liability Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. D.16.</span></p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Dog Owners’
    Liability Act</i> applies to the owners of all breeds of dogs in Ontario.  It deals generally with matters of
    responsible dog ownership and, amongst other things, imposes civil liability on
    owners of dogs that bite or attack.  In
    addition, it provides that in certain circumstances a court may order that a
    dog be destroyed or impose other security measures with respect to the dog.  These provisions apply to all breeds of dogs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005, however, the landscape changed for pit bulls.  Responding to a series of brutal attacks by
    pit bulls on children and others, the Ontario legislature introduced amendments
    to the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i> directed specifically at that breed of dog.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Relevant
    Statutory Provisions</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant provisions of the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i> are the following:</p>

name=BK6></a><b>4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class=GramE>A</span> proceeding may be commenced in the Ontario Court of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> dog has bitten or
    attacked a person or domestic animal;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>the</span> dog has behaved in
    a manner that poses a menace to the safety of persons or domestic animals; or</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) <span class=GramE>behaving</span> in a manner

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P114_5467"></a><a name=s4s3></a>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If,
    in a proceeding under subsection (1), the court finds that the dog has bitten
    or attacked a person or domestic animal or that the dog’s behaviour is such
    that the dog is a menace to the safety of persons or domestic animals, and the
    court is satisfied that an order is necessary for the protection of the public,
    the court may order,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>that</span> the dog be
    destroyed in the manner specified in the order; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <span class=GramE>that</span> the owner of the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P118_6132"></a><a name=s4s4></a>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
    examples of measures that may be ordered under subsection (2) or clause (3) (b)
    are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. Confining the dog to its owner’s property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. Restraining the dog by means of a leash.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. Restraining the dog by means of a muzzle.</p>

    as provided by subsections (8) and (9), in exercising its powers to make an

    circumstances:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The dog’s past and present temperament and
    behaviour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The seriousness of the injuries caused by the
    biting or attack.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. Unusual contributing circumstances tending to

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. The improbability that a similar attack will be

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. The dog’s physical potential for inflicting
    harm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6. Precautions taken by the owner to preclude

  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Summary
    Conviction Appeal Judge’s Decision</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge concluded that the
    language of subsection 4(8) is ambiguous, having regard to the words “the court
    shall make an order under clause (3<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)” read in the
    context of section 4 as a whole and in light of the purposes and objects of the
    Act.  She said that the phrase “under
    clause (3)(a)” is subject to two interpretations, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    the court has no discretion but to make an order pursuant to s. 4(3)(a), but in
    doing so, the court must have regard to whether the order is “necessary for the
    protection of the public” because that is one of the prerequisites for the
    usual s. 4(3)(a) order and, because of the words “under clause (3)(a)”, the
    legislature must have intended to incorporate all of those prerequisites into
    the analysis; or,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    if the dog has been found to be a pit bull and to have bitten or attacked
    another domestic animal or a person, or has behaved in a manner that poses a
    menace to the safety of persons or other animals, a destruction order must be
    made without there being a requirement that the court be satisfied such an
    order is necessary for the protection of the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge opted for the first
    of these interpretations.  She concluded
    that it best fulfilled the objects of the legislation and that, if the legislature
    had intended the second interpretation, it could easily have said, simply, that
    the court “shall make an order that the dog be destroyed in the manner
    specified in the order,” rather than referring to an “order under clause (3<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a),” which it did not do.  She also concluded that the second interpretation could lead to an absurd
    result, for example, if an individual were breaking into a home where a pit
    bull resided and that pit bull in the course of protecting his owner and his
    owner’s home bit the burglar, that pit bull would have to be destroyed.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Discussion</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, the summary conviction appeal judge’s
    interpretation of s. 4(8) is not tenable, in my view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The underlying purpose of Bill 132, which introduced
    the amendments to the <i>Dog Owners’
    Liability Act</i> targeting pit bulls, was to create a legislative scheme that,
    over time, would eliminate pit bulls from the Province of Ontario.  The breeding, sale and ownership of pit bulls
    were prohibited, subject to a grandfathering clause that permitted owners to
    keep “restricted pit bulls” (i.e., those born before Bill 132 came into force
    or up to 90 days thereafter) subject to compliance with certain safety
    measures.  For example, restricted pit
    bulls had to be sterilized and were required to be leashed and muzzled when in
    public.  As noted above, the impetus for
    the amendments was a series of then recent pit bull attacks causing serious
    injury, and the rationale underlying the legislation was based upon evidence
    that pit bulls are uniquely aggressive and unpredictable, often attacking
    without warning or provocation, and that they pose an inherent danger to the
    public.  See <i>Cochrane v. Ontario (A.G.)</i> (2008), 92 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused, [2009] S.C.C.A. No. 105.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not concerned here with the policy debate over
    the wisdom, or lack of wisdom, underlying the enactment of the 2005
    amendments.  The legislation has been
    found to be constitutional – see <i>Cochrane</i> – and the legislature is entitled to make choices within its constitutional
    mandate.  We are concerned with the
    proper statutory interpretation of subsection 4(8).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The words of an Act are to be read in their entire
    context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense, and harmoniously with the
    scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of the legislature: <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 26 and 27, citing Elmer A. Driedger, <i>The Construction of Statutes</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at p. 87.  Within that framework, the ordinary meaning of legislation is “the
    natural meaning which appears when the provision is simply read through”: <i>York Condominium Corp. No. 382 v. Jay-M
    Holdings Ltd.</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d) 414 (C.A.), at paras. 11-13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying those principles here, I have no hesitation in
    concluding that the ordinary and natural meaning of the language in s. 4(8) of
    the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i> is
    clear and unambiguous: once a dog is found to be a pit bull, and to have bitten
    or attacked another domestic animal or a person, or to have behaved in a manner
    that poses a menace to the safety of persons or domestic animals, the court is
    mandated to order that the pit bull be destroyed in the manner specified in the
    order.  Any other interpretation flouts
    the purpose and object of the amendment, viewed in the context of section 4 in
    its entirety – including the pit bull amendments – and the plain wording of the
    Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simply put, to interpret the language of s. 4(8) –
    because of its reference to making “an order under clause (3)(a)” – as reading
    back into the equation a requirement that the destruction order be “necessary
    for the protection of the public”, is to eviscerate the s. 4(8) amendment and
    render it superfluous: there would be no need for the amendment because the end
    result would be that pit bulls would be treated the same way as all breeds of
    dogs have traditionally been treated under s. 4(3).  That is clearly inconsistent with the
    legislature’s intent in introducing specific measures regarding pit bulls.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge was concerned that
    a dog might be ordered destroyed “in circumstances where the dog had no
    culpability whatsoever.”  She gave as an
    example the scenario cited above, namely that of a pit bull defending its owner
    and its owner’s property in the event of a break-in, and biting the intruder in
    the process.  That the pit bull would
    have to be put down in those circumstances – assuming the burglar pursued the
    issue – she considered to be an absurdity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leaving aside the question whether canine “culpability”
    – or <i>mens rea</i> – is a factor to be
    considered in the s. 4(8) analysis, the legislature is entitled to make choices.  Given the overall purpose of the pit bull
    amendments referred to above – which in effect leave pit bulls in existence in
    Ontario virtually on sufferance – I am not persuaded that such a result would
    amount to an absurdity.  But, in any
    event, the clear wording of a statute must be given effect even if it may lead
    to an absurdity.  In <i>Beattie v. National Frontier Insurance Co.</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 60
    (C.A.), at para. 15, Borins J.A. observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As Professor Sullivan points out, at p. 129,
    legislation is presumed to be accurate and well-drafted consequent to the
    presumption that the legislature does not make mistakes.  Thus, if the words of an Act are clear, they
    must be followed even though they lead to a manifest absurdity.  As a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada
    commented in R v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686 ... at p. 704:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]here, by use of clear
    and unequivocal language capable of only one meaning, anything is enacted by
    the legislature, it must be enforced however harsh or absurd or contrary to
    common sense the result may <span class=GramE>be ....</span> The fact that a
    provision gives rise to absurd results is not, in my opinion, sufficient to
    declare it ambiguous and then embark upon a broad-ranging interpretive
    analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be fair, the summary conviction appeal judge did not
    use the “absurdity” notion to determine that the language was ambiguous.  Having found that it was ambiguous and
    capable of two interpretations, she used the absurdity concept as a basis for
    choosing one over the other.  That may
    have been an appropriate technique in another context.  But here, as I have said, the language of s.
    4(8) is clear.  There was no ambiguity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another anomaly arising from the summary conviction appeal
    judge’s interpretation of s. 4(8) is the incompatibility of that interpretation
    with s. 4(6) cited above.  If the court
    is to address a destruction order under s. 4(8) through the prism of the
    “necessity for the protection of the public” requirement of s. 4(3), it would
    have to consider the various factors enumerated in s. 4(6), which for
    convenience I restate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Considerations</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
    as provided by subsections (8) and (9), in exercising its powers to make an
    order under subsection (3), the court may take into consideration the following
    circumstances:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The dog’s past and present temperament and
    behaviour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The seriousness of the injuries caused by the
    biting or attack.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. Unusual contributing circumstances tending to
    justify the dog’s action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. The improbability that a similar attack will be
    repeated.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. The dog’s physical potential for inflicting
    harm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6. Precautions taken by the owner to preclude
    similar attacks in the future.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7. Any other circumstances that the court considers
    to be relevant. <span class=GramE>2000, c.&nbsp;26, Sched.</span> A, s.&nbsp;6;
    2005, c.&nbsp;2, s.&nbsp;1&nbsp;(12).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What other underlying considerations could be in play
    when deciding whether to make a destruction order?  Yet s. 4(6) explicitly eliminates those
    factors when an order is being made under s. 4(8).  Since the language of s. 4(8) must be
    interpreted in light of the provisions of s. 4 as a whole, the explicit
    elimination of the s. 4(6) considerations when ss. 4(8) and (9) are engaged
    reinforces the interpretation I have placed on the language of s. 4(8).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from his ambiguity argument, Mr. Ruby made two
    further submissions on behalf of the respondent.  First, he contended that the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i> must be interpreted
    in such a way as to ensure harmony and coherence with other legislation dealing
    with the treatment of animals.  Section
    445.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides
    that it is an offence (a) to wilfully cause unnecessary pain, suffering or
    injury to an animal or (b) to wilfully, without reasonable excuse, administer a
    poisonous or an injurious drug or substance to a domestic animal.  An interpretation of s. 4(8) that would
    mandate the destruction of an animal without any consideration of whether that
    destruction is “necessary” in the public interest, Mr. Ruby says, would be tantamount
    to animal cruelty and inconsistent with this provision in the <i>Code.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no merit in this argument.  Even if the principle of harmonization
    applies in a contest between validly enacted federal legislation and validly
    enacted provincial legislation – about which we make no comment – s. 445.1 of
    the <i>Code</i> and s. 4(8) of the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i> are directed
    at entirely different circumstances.  Section 445.1 is aimed at preventing acts of cruelty towards animals by
    people.  Subsection 4(8) is directed
    towards enforcing a constitutionally valid state purpose having to do with the
    protection of society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I see any merit in the argument that the <i>noscitur a sociis</i> rule of statutory
    interpretation should apply to support the summary conviction appeal judge’s
    interpretation.  While Mr. Ruby
    acknowledges that the Supreme Court of Canada has taken a cautious approach to
    the application of this rule so as not to defeat the true intention of the
    legislature, he submits it is nonetheless a helpful tool.  Essentially, the rule means that where words
    that are susceptible of analogous meaning are used together, their meaning is
    influenced by and take their colour from the words with which they are
    associated: P. Côté<span lang=EN-US>, <i>The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</i>,
    3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2000), at p. 263; P. St. J. Langan, <i>Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes</i>,
    12<sup>th</sup> ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1969), at p. 289.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the argument is that the legislature could not
    have intended the word “bitten” in ss. 4(3) and 4(8) of the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i>, to include
    all bites, however minor – such as a puppy bite, which happens in the case of
    almost all puppies.  It must be an
    “aggressive” bite, because the word is associated with the words “attacked” and
    “menace”, which suggest offensive aggression, as opposed to something minor or
    a defensive response.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Ruby concedes, however, the rule is not to be
    used to defeat the clear intention of the legislature.  In my view, as expressed above, the intention
    of the legislature is clear:  when it
    comes to pit bulls, one bite or attack, or one menacing act as contemplated by s.
    4(8) mandates the court to issue a destruction order.  The legislature did not contemplate a debate
    over whether the dog’s conduct was an act of aggression, or whether it occurred
    in circumstances of play or provocation or self-protection or the protection of
    humans or their property.</p>
  <h3>Disposition and Remedy</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the summary
    conviction appeal judge erred in her interpretation of s. 4(8) of the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i>.  Her order is set aside and the order of the
    Justice of the Peace reinstated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Davies argued on behalf of the respondent that if
    we concluded the summary conviction appeal judge had erred in her
    interpretation of s. 4(8), we should send the matter back for a new trial as a
    remedy.  This submission was based on the
    argument that the Justice of the Peace had erred in his treatment of the expert
    evidence before him – he failed to prefer the evidence of the respondent’s
    expert (who, it was submitted, was far better qualified and reliable),
    concluding instead that he could not choose between them – and that the summary
    conviction appeal judge had erred in failing to set aside the decision at first
    instance on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject this submission.  Even if the issue is properly before us, I see
    no merit in it.  Two courts below have
    come to the same conclusion.  There is no
    basis for interfering with those decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the
    Justice of the Peace directing the destruction of Ginger under s. 4(8) as
    mandated by the Act is reinstated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize this decision will be difficult for Mr.
    Huggins, and the result perhaps incomprehensible to him.  Like pet owners generally, he is undoubtedly
    very fond of Ginger and sees her as the friendly dog and docile pet his mother
    portrayed at trial.  The legislature has
    decided, however – as it is entitled to do – that pit bulls are inherently
    dangerous animals that pose a risk to public safety by their very presence in
    public places.  The language of s. 4(8)
    is clear and unambiguous about what is to happen when a pit bull contravenes
    its provisions, and must be given effect.</p>
