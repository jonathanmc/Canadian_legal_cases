  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals from the sentencing judge's decision
    not to make an order requiring the respondent to register under the <i>Sex Offender Information Registration Act</i>,
    S.C. 2004, c. 10<i> (SOIRA)</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;The respondent pleaded guilty to sexual
    interference. The facts read in on the guilty plea indicated the respondent,
    who was 20 at the time of the offence, had unprotected intercourse with a 13
    year-old girl. When asked by the police, the victim said the intercourse was
    consensual. However, it was also apparent that she was under the influence of
    drugs and alcohol at the time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;In declining to make an order that the respondent
    register under SOIRA, the sentencing judge said: &quot;I don't think the facts
    warrant it. Certainly, this would be an even more harsh judgment on this young
    man's foolishness getting involved in this situation  ... I'm satisfied that this would be a
    serious impediment to him as he goes forward with his life.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;We accept the Crown submission that the
    sentencing judge erred in failing to make a SOIRA registration order.  &nbsp;Section 490.012(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides that “a court
    shall” make a registration order where the Crown requests it when imposing sentence
    for a designated offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only exception to this compulsory order is in s.
    490.012(4) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    which provides that a judge is not required to make a registration order if the
    person “has established that, if the order were made, the impact on them,
    including on their privacy or liberty, would be grossly disproportionate to the
    public interest in protecting society through the effective investigation of
    crimes of a sexual nature, to be achieved by the registration of information
    relating to sex offenders under the <i>Sex
    Offender Information Registration Act</i>.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; In <i>R. v.
    Debiden</i>, 2008 ONCA 868, this court described the impact of registration on
    an offender’s privacy interests as minimal given the nature of the information
    required from a registrant and the circumstances in which it can be
    disseminated. Further, the impact of registration on an offender’s liberty
    interests are modest as registration does “not prohibit [the offender] from going
    anywhere or doing anything.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;In this case, the offender presented no evidence
    indicating any particular impacts a registration order would have on him. The
    standard of grossly disproportionate is a high threshold and requires the
    offender to establish more than a simple imbalance of individual impact over
    public interest. On the facts of this case, there was simply no evidence
    capable of meeting what we emphasize is a high statutory threshold and the
    sentencing judge’s conclusion that registration “would be a serious detriment”
    amounted to impermissible speculation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;On appeal, the respondent raises factors
    demonstrating the respondent’s reduced risk of recidivism as justifying refusal
    of a registration order. However, in <i>R.
    v. Debiden</i> at para. 70, this court made it clear that it is an error to
    enhance the impact on an offender or to dilute the public interest in
    registration on the basis of a diminished risk of recidivism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is
    allowed and a 20 year SOIRA registration order is imposed.</p>
