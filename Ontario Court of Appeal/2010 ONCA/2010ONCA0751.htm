    outcome of this appeal turns on the interpretation of s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and, in particular, the extent of the
    authority conferred upon a board of directors elected at a meeting held
    pursuant to s. 43 of the <i>Act</i> to
    terminate pre-existing obligations of a condominium corporation.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    relevant parts of s. 112 read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>112     (1) Subject to subsection (4), a corporation
    may, by resolution of the board within 12 months following the election of a
    new board at a meeting held in accordance with subsection 43(1), terminate an
    agreement mentioned in subsection (2) that the corporation has entered into
    with a person other than another corporation before the election of the new board.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(2)  Subsection (1) applies to the following agreements …</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>2.  An
    agreement for the provision of facilities to the corporation on other than a
    non-profit basis.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Position of the
    Parties </span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant accepts that the New Board was properly elected under s. 43(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  Further, it is common ground that the New Board purported to terminate
    the obligation to purchase the manager’s unit within 12 months of its
    election.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant submits, however, that although s. 112 gave the New Board the authority
    to terminate the Purchase Agreement, it did not confer authority to terminate
    the Corporation’s obligation to purchase the manager’s unit, which obligation
    arose from the Declaration. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Specifically,
    the appellant argues that the obligation to purchase that arose from the
    Declaration, is not “an agreement … that the corporation [had] entered into”
    before the election of the New Board so as to be subject to the authority to
    terminate in s. 112.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant points out that the Corporation’s obligation to purchase the
    manager’s unit was fully and accurately disclosed to all unit owners before they
    agreed to purchase their units and argues that there would be no unfairness in
    requiring the Corporation to fulfill this obligation.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    response, the Corporation argues that the <i>Act</i> is consumer protection legislation.  As
    such, the power to terminate found in s. 112 must be interpreted broadly.  One of the objectives of s. 112 is to allow a
    board of directors elected by unit owners to scrutinize all of the arrangements
    put into place by the corporation while it was controlled by the <span
class=SpellE>declarant</span>, and to terminate agreements which the board,
    elected by the unit owners, considers not fair or desirable for the condominium
    corporation. In order to fulfill this objective, the power to terminate in s.
    112 should be interpreted to include all pre-existing obligations of the condominium
    corporation, including those arising from a declaration.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Corporation submits there is no unfairness to a <span class=SpellE>declarant</span> in interpreting s. 112 in the manner suggested.  When <span class=SpellE>declarants</span>, such as the appellant in this
    case, register a declaration creating obligations on a condominium corporation,
    they do so with the knowledge that the board, elected by the unit owners, may
    terminate the obligations within 12 months of its election.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Corporation also argues that the disclosure of the obligation to purchase the
    manager’s unit to prospective purchasers does not eliminate the power of the board
    elected by unit owners to terminate under s. 112.  If it were otherwise, a developer could
    exempt itself from the <i>Act</i> based on
    disclosure.  That would be a convenient
    means of bypassing the intent of the Legislature.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    the Corporation argues that the <i>Act</i> is paramount to a declaration.  A right
    given under the <i>Act</i>, such as that in
    s. 112, cannot be taken away by a declaration.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    application judge did not address directly the issue of the application of s.
    112 to the Declaration.  However,
    implicit in her decision is the conclusion that the New Board’s authority to
    terminate an agreement extended to an obligation created by the
    Declaration.  Indeed, she ordered that,
    if necessary, the Declaration be amended to delete the Corporation’s obligation
    to purchase the manager’s unit so that the Declaration would take into account
    the authority of the New Board under s. 112 to terminate that obligation. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In

    start with the ordinary meaning of the words in issue.  The power to terminate in s. 112 applies to “agreement[s]
    … that the corporation has entered into with a person other than another
    [condominium] corporation”.  The ordinary
    meaning of the word “agreements” does not include “declarations”.  The word “agreements” when used in a legal
    context generally refers to legally binding contracts entered into by two or
    more parties.  Declarations, on the other
    hand, are statutorily prescribed documents that are prepared and registered by
    developers. It is upon the registration of the declaration that a condominium
    corporation comes into existence and the developer becomes the <span
class=SpellE>declarant</span>.  Declarations
    have been referred to as the equivalent of the constitution of a condominium corporation.  They provide the legal framework for condominium
    corporations upon which the purchasers of units, and <span class=SpellE>declarants</span>,
    can rely (A.M. Loeb, <i>The Condominium Act<span
class=GramE>:  A</span> User’s Manual</i>,
    3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (Toronto:  Carswell,

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Declarations
    become legally effective upon registration.  Unlike agreements, they are not “entered into” with another person.  The use of the phrase, “that a corporation has
    entered into” in s. 112 suggests an action by a corporation after its creation.
    This language does not seem to relate to a <span class=SpellE>declarant’s</span> actions in preparing and registering a declaration, thereby creating a
    condominium corporation.  </span></p>

    number of respects.  They are created
    differently: a developer prepares and registers a declaration; whereas once
    created, condominium corporations may enter into agreements with others to
    carry out their objects.  The <i>Act</i> gives declarations legal effect on
    registration.  The legal effect of
    agreements arises from contract law.  Declarations
    and agreements are enforced differently: those with an interest in a
    condominium corporation have the statutory right to enforce compliance with a
    declaration, whereas parties to an agreement involving a condominium corporation
    do not have a statutory right to enforce, but are left to pursue remedies under
    the law of contract.</span></p>

    hand, section 112 authorizes a board of directors, elected by unit holders, to
    terminate, by simple resolution, certain agreements entered into by a <span

    7(5) provides that if any provision in a declaration is inconsistent with the
    provisions of the <i>Act</i>, the provisions
    of the <i>Act</i> prevail and the
    declaration shall be deemed to be amended accordingly.  The Corporation’s argument is premised on the
    notion that if a declaration does not specifically include the power to
    terminate under s. 112, it is inconsistent with the <i>Act</i> and the authority in s. 112 must prevail.  The flaw in this argument is that it presumes
    that s. 112 applies to a declaration.  If
    s. 112 only applies to agreements, as the ordinary language and the scheme of

    their purchases.  A disclosure statement
    must include a copy of the declaration.  Purchasers are given a 10-day “cooling off period” with rights of

    a condominium corporation by way of the declaration in relation to the common

    consistent with the objects of the corporation that may be specified in the
    declaration.  Furthermore, in the
    circumstances of this case, where it can be taken that unit owners have relied
    on the representations contained in the declaration, I think, for the reasons
