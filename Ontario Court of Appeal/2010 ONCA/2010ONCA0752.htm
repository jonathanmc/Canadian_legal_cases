lang=EN-US>I.          Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Paul Hylton, appeals part of a judgment dated
    December 4, 2009, in which the motion judge granted summary judgment against
    him in favour of the respondent, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, in the amount of
    $81,660.18 plus interest and costs.  Mr.
    Hylton does not contest that he owes the bank $14,464.14 of this amount, but he
    seeks to set aside two other terms of the judgment that comprise the remaining
    $67,196.04. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Hylton submits that he has a defence to the
    contested portion of the judgment: namely, that Keywell Industries Inc., the
    company for which he works, is responsible for the debt to the Bank.  He argues that in the light of the
    circumstances giving rise to the judgment, he was unfairly deprived of the
    opportunity to advance this defence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Hylton seeks to support his position through
    material contained in a fresh evidence motion.  This material addresses his relationship with Keywell and its
    responsibility to the Bank under the two loans in dispute, as well as his
    personal circumstances in late 2009 that explain why he did not defend the
    motion for summary judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons I would admit the fresh
    evidence and give Mr. Hylton an opportunity to defend the Bank’s claims under
    the two disputed loans.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>II.        The Action</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action arises out of three agreements for credit
    facilities with the Bank pursuant to which the Bank says Mr. Hylton owes it
    money.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 30, 2005, a TD visa agreement was entered
    into with a $10,500 credit limit.  Payments
    went into default prior to January 21, 2009, and on March 23, 2009, the
    outstanding amount was called in and the credit facility was closed.  The Bank claims that as of October 16, 2009,
    the amount owing to it pursuant to this account was $13,850.38, with interest
    accumulating at $9.01 per day.  Mr.
    Hylton acknowledges that he owed this amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 6, 2006, a TD visa agreement was entered
    into with a $25,000 credit limit.  No
    payments were made after September 17, 2008 towards the outstanding amount
    owing. The Bank called in the loan and closed the facility on March 27,
    2009.  The Bank claims that as of October
    16, 2009, the amount owing to it was $29,578.46, with daily interest accruing
    in the amount of $16.43. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 29, 2007, a loan agreement was entered into
    under which the Bank advanced $38,847.14 for the purchase of a car. No payments
    were made after
    <st1:date Year="2008" Day="29" Month="9" w:st="on">
    September
    29, 2008.  As of April 1,
    2009, there remained $32,808.90 outstanding under this loan agreement.  Upon default, the Bank unsuccessfully attempted
    to locate and recover the car.  The Bank
    claims that as of October 16, 2009, the amount owing to it was $36,084.11, with
    daily interest accumulating in the amount of $8.48, plus the bailiff fee for
    the attempt to recover the car in the amount of $376.95. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By statement of claim issued August 4, 2009, the Bank
    sued Mr. Hylton to recover the amounts outstanding under these three credit
    facilities.  Mr. Hylton, then
    self-represented, delivered a hand-written statement of defence dated September
    9, 2009.  In that defence, read
    generously, Mr. Hylton referred to making payment arrangements, needing time to
    consult a lawyer, and wanting to move the file to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By a Simplified Procedure Motion Form dated
    <st1:date
Year="2009" Day="13" Month="10" w:st="on">
    October 13, 2009, the Bank
    moved for summary judgment under what was then rule 76.07 of the Simplified
    Rules. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    <st1:date Year="2009" Day="20" Month="11" w:st="on">
    November
    20, 2009, the first return date of the motion, Mr. Hylton neither
    appeared nor filed any material in defence of the motion. However, his brother
    came to court on Mr. Hylton’s behalf.  He
    requested an adjournment “for at least a couple of months” on the basis that
    his brother was ill.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Borkovich J. adjourned the motion for two weeks, until
    <st1:date
Year="2009" Day="4" Month="12" w:st="on">
    December 4, 2009, and
    gratuitously added the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’ve also read the papers here and I don’t think
    [Mr. Hylton has] got much hope in this matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    <st1:date Year="2009" Day="4" Month="12" w:st="on">
    December
    4, 2009, Mr. Hylton’s brother again appeared on Mr. Hylton’s behalf.  Again, no response material had been
    filed.  Mr. Hylton’s brother advised the
    court that “He’s been basically sick, basically cannot travel, right.  So I am basically asking for more time to get
    legal aid.”  He submitted a doctor’s note
    stating that Mr. Hylton was “not medically fit to attend court”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge rejected this as a justification for
    failing to “file responding material outlining even the possibility of a
    defence” and refused the adjournment request, commenting that he was doing Mr.
    Hylton a favour.  He explained his
    decision to deny the adjournment request as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If I thought there was any hope of a successful
    defence to these claims I would give him an opportunity to have his day in
    court.  His pleadings do not reveal any
    possibility of a defence.  If I put the
    matter over, that would simply result in greater costs incurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to this remark and the motion judge’s
    comments that “court time is very valuable” and an adjournment would result in
    “at least another $1000 in costs”, Mr. Hylton’s brother indicated he would
    accept the responsibility to pay court costs and again implored the motion
    judge to give his brother a chance to defend. He promised that there would be
    no further adjournment requests.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge held fast to his decision to end the
    matter then and there and proceeded to grant judgment in favour of the Bank, saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Though this court accepts Paul Hylton may be ill
    today that does not explain his failure to file any responding material in the
    time granted him prior to today’s date.  Upon consideration of the material filed and submissions of Mr.
    Touesnard and Mr. Peter Hylton, this court directs judgment in accordance with
    the draft filed. </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>1.         The motion to adduce
    fresh evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this appeal, Mr. Hylton, now
    represented by counsel, seeks to adduce fresh evidence explaining both his
    delay in defending the summary judgment motion and the basis upon which he
    proposes to persuade the court that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial
    in relation to two of the loans.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the issue of his delay in responding to
    the demands of the summary judgment motion, Mr. Hylton has filed an affidavit
    indicating that in late November and early December 2009, he had just lost his
    sister and taken on the responsibility of caring for her three children.  In addition, he had broken several ribs and
    was in chronic pain.  His being
    overwhelmed by stress and by emotional and physical pain not only prevented him
    from travelling to Brantford (he lived in Toronto) to attend court, but also
    from preparing proper materials in defence of the Bank’s motion.  His proposed evidence includes an affidavit
    sworn by his mother and a letter from his doctor in support of his description
    of these personal circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to his proposed response to the Bank’s
    claim, Mr. Hylton, in his affidavit, says that his statement of defence was
    misunderstood.  He did not admit to owing
    the outstanding amounts under all three loans.  He only admitted to being responsible for the December 2005 TD visa
    account.  With respect to the other two
    loans, Mr. Hylton says that, to the Bank’s knowledge, the car purchase loan and
    the October 2006 TD visa agreement, were entered into on behalf of Keywell.  Mr. Hylton therefore proposes to defend the
    October 2006 Visa loan and the car loan on the basis that he is not the
    borrower.  He also intends to issue a
    third party claim against Autopark Superstore Inc. o/a Autopark Mitsubishi, the
    company that sold the car, on the basis that it made misrepresentations to him
    regarding the car loan arrangement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank resists the admission of fresh evidence on the
    basis that it fails to pass the test established in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.  In <i>Palmer</i>, McIntyre J. held at
    p. 775 that the test for admissibility of fresh evidence encompasses four
    principles:  the evidence should
    generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at
    trial; the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive
    or potentially decisive issue; the evidence must be credible in the sense that
    it is reasonably capable of belief; and it must be such that if believed it
    could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced, be expected to have
    affected the result.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion to adduce fresh evidence was served only two
    days before the hearing.  Understandably,
    the Bank did not have time to respond.  Counsel
    for the Bank was, therefore, asked if he wanted an adjournment to challenge the
    proposed fresh evidence.  This offer was
    refused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the Bank opposed Mr. Hylton’s request to
    adduce fresh evidence in oral argument.  The
    Bank submits that the proposed evidence was physically available before the
    date when the motion for summary judgment was heard and disposed of.  Moreover, the Bank contends that the
    evidence, considered in the light of the loan documentation, could not affect
    the result.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the fresh evidence to be admitted.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I agree with counsel for the Bank that the
    information contained in the motion for fresh evidence was available in the
    sense that, to Mr. Hylton’s knowledge, it existed at the time the motion was
    scheduled to be heard in December 2009.  However,
    that fact alone is not sufficient to establish lack of due diligence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. 1275729 Ontario Inc.</i> <span lang=FR-CA style='line-height:200%;'>(2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 501
    (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    at para. </span><span style='line-height:200%'>29, self
    representation is a relevant factor in the consideration of whether the due
    diligence test has been met:</span></p>
  <p>The due diligence criterion is context
    sensitive and, as acknowledged in <i>Palmer</i> itself, must be applied
    with regard to the nature of the proceedings in which the appeal arises.  For example, if an appellant was
    self-represented at trial..., an appeal court would be entitled to take that
    fact into consideration in deciding whether due diligence had been exercised at
    trial and, if not, the weight that should be attributed to that failure in
    determining whether to admit fresh evidence proffered on appeal.  Under the <i>Palmer</i> approach to due diligence,
    that factor gets the weight that the “interests of justice” demand that it
    should get in any given circumstance.  Self representation could in some circumstances diminish the impact of
    the failure to exercise due diligence on the admissibility of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this idea is expressed in the context of a
    criminal matter, I see no reason why a contextual approach should not be taken
    in civil cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Hylton, a self-represented litigant, was unable to
    prepare his defence materials and present them to the court at that time due to
    serious personal circumstances, the existence of which has not been challenged.
     I do not agree with the Bank that Mr.
    Hylton failed to exercise due diligence as required under the <i>Palmer</i> test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue to consider is whether the evidence
    could be expected to have affected the result – in this case meaning the motion
    judge’s decision to grant summary judgment in favour of the Bank based on his
    conclusion that there was no issue that warranted a trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank submits that Mr. Hylton has, in his proposed
    fresh evidence, been given the opportunity to put his “best foot forward” in
    order to persuade this court that there is a genuine issue requiring a
    trial.  The Bank argues that even now,
    having availed himself of this opportunity, Mr. Hylton’s defence is
    insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the record before this court, I cannot agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank supports its motion for summary judgment
    through an affidavit sworn by Mr. Tomlinson, a debt recovery officer at the
    Bank.  His affidavit contains exhibits that
    purport to document the terms of the credit facilities in issue and the
    circumstances under which payments were made and the loans went into default. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with this record is twofold.  First, the documents upon which the Bank
    relies, examined in the light of Mr. Hylton’s argument that he is not the
    borrower, do not present a sufficiently clear picture to ground a
    judgment.  Specifically, the identity of
    the borrower, including who made the payments, is unclear, as are the Bank’s
    rights upon default.  Second, Mr. Hylton
    has now tendered evidence, at this point unchallenged, that to the knowledge of
    the Bank and Autopark, it was never intended that he assume personal
    responsibility for the loans in question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, I am persuaded that the fresh
    evidence could reasonably be expected to affect the motion judge’s decision concerning
    whether or not to grant summary judgment in the Bank’s favour in relation to
    the loans in issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore allow the motion to adduce fresh
    evidence and proceed to consider the appeal in the light of the evidence
    contained in Mr. Hylton’s motion materials.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will now deal with the motion judge’s decision to
    deny the request for an adjournment on December 4, 2009.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The presiding judge has a well-placed and a
    well-established discretion to decide whether an adjournment request ought to
    be allowed or denied.  In <i>Khimji v. Dhanani</i> (2004), 69 O.R. (3d)
    790 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    the majority accepted Laskin J.A.’s statement of the principles applicable to
    reviewing a denial of an adjournment.  Laskin J.A. wrote at para. 14 of his dissent: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A trial judge enjoys wide latitude in deciding
    whether to grant or refuse the adjournment of a scheduled civil trial.  The decision is discretionary and the scope
    for appellate intervention is correspondingly limited.  In exercising this discretion, however, the
    trial judge should balance the interests of the plaintiff, the interests of the
    defendant and the interests of the administration of justice in the orderly
    processing of civil trials on their merits.  In any particular case, several considerations may bear on these interests.  A trial judge who fails to take account of
    relevant considerations may exercise his or her discretion unreasonably and if,
    as a result, the decision is contrary to the interests of justice, an appellate
    court is justified in intervening.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Laskin J.A.’s passage makes it clear that, in reviewing
    highly discretionary decisions such as whether to allow a request for an
    adjournment, the inquiry must focus on whether the court below took account of
    relevant considerations in balancing the competing interests and made a
    decision that was in keeping with the interests of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against the backdrop of the nature of the proceeding
    and the parties to the proceeding, the court should consider the evidence and
    strength of the evidence of the reason for the adjournment request, the history
    of the matter including deliberate delay or misuse of the court process, the
    prejudice to the party resisting the adjournment and the consequences to the
    requesting party of refusing the request.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once again, the fact that a party is self-represented
    is a relevant factor.  That is not to say
    that a self-represented party is entitled to a “pass”.  However, as part of the court’s obligation to
    ensure that all litigants have a fair opportunity to advance their positions, the
    court must assist self-represented parties so they can present their cases to
    the best of their abilities.  Linhares de
    Sousa J. provided a helpful list of ways to assist self-represented litigants in <i>Kainz v. Potter</i> (2006), 33 R.F.L. (6<sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%'>th</span></sup>) 62 (
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ont.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    S.C.),
    at para. 65:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[N]umerous Court decisions have reiterated the
    principle again and again, that self-represented parties are entitled to
    receive assistance from an adjudicator to permit them to fairly present their
    case on the issues in question.  This may
    include directions on procedure, the nature of the evidence that can be
    presented, the calling of witnesses, the form of questioning, <i>requests
    for adjournments</i> and even the raising of substantive and evidentiary
    issues. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case the adjournment request was made against
    the following background.  It, as well as
    the first request, was put forward respectfully and responsibly by Mr. Hylton’s
    brother.  It was for valid personal
    reasons and payment of court costs was offered in addition to a guarantee that
    there would be no further adjournment requests. There was no history of delay
    or manipulation of the proceedings on the part of Mr. Hylton.  The case moved quickly - three months - from
    the pleadings stage to the motion for summary judgment. There was no evidence there
    would be any prejudice to the Bank as a result of an adjournment.  It is worth noting that, in respect of the
    two loan facilities in issue, Mr. Hylton went into default in September 2008, yet
    the Bank did not issue its statement of claim until August of 2009.  Finally, the consequences to Mr. Hylton of
    refusing to grant the adjournment were significant – he was deprived of an
    opportunity to defend the action.   It does not appear that any of these factors
    were considered by the motion judge in denying the adjournment request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only factor that appears to have been considered
    was the motion judge’s opinion of Mr. Hylton’s ability to defend the
    motion.  With respect, it simply cannot
    be that an otherwise valid request for an adjournment in order to file defence
    material can legitimately be denied on the sole basis that the motion judge
    finds there is no possibility of a defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that in my view the motion judge erred in
    refusing the adjournment request by failing to take account of relevant
    considerations, thereby exercising his discretion in a manner contrary to the
    interests of justice.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons I would allow the appeal in part and
    set aside terms 1 and 2 of the judgment and remit the matter back to the
    Superior Court without prejudice to the Bank’s right to proceed with its motion
    for summary judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, costs of this appeal should be in the

    which the principal amount of $28,559.74 is claimed was issued by the
    respondent in the name of Keywell Industries supports the defence asserted by
    the appellant.  No explanation as to why
    the card was issued in the name of Keywell Industries was offered on this
    appeal.</span>  I agree with my colleague
    that as the appellant was a self-represented litigant before the motion judge,
    some latitude should be accorded to him on the due diligence consideration in
    relation to the admissibility of the fresh evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I respectfully disagree with my colleague that the
    motion judge erred in denying the request for an adjournment made on December
    4, 2009.  The appellant had been given
    one adjournment and the opportunity to file a response to the respondent’s
    summary judgment motion.  He failed to
    file any response and, for the second time, sent his brother to ask for an
    adjournment.  The medical evidence filed
    in support of the adjournment request was weak.  It consisted of a hand-written note dated December 1, 2009, initialled
    by a doctor, identifying the appellant and stating “[t]he above patient is not
    medically fit to attend Court.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s statement of defence admitted liability
    on one of the accounts, baldly denied liability on another account on which the
    respondent claimed the principal amount of $35,483.41, and was silent on the
    third account.  No facts were pleaded in
    defence.  Apart from the blanket
    admissions and denials, the statement of defence said only this:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would like to make payment arrangements.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would like to have time to consult a lawyer.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can the file be moved to Toronto where I live and do
    business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant filed no evidence in answer to the
    respondent’s motion for summary judgment.  When the appellant’s first request for an adjournment was granted, the
    judge granting the adjournment informed the appellant’s brother that the facts
    pleaded in the statement of defence did not offer him much hope.  Despite this warning, no further evidence or
    defence was filed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, it is my view that the motion
    judge did not err in placing some weight on the fact that the appellant’s
    defence to the respondent’s claim appeared to be hopeless.  The motion judge was faced with a situation
    where a self-represented litigant had twice failed to appear, had offered weak
    evidence in support of the claim that he was too ill to attend, and had filed a
    defence which, on its face, appeared to admit liability for bank loans and
    credit card balances and to ask for no more than time to pay.  In those circumstances, I see no error on the
    part of the motion judge in concluding that the appellant had no defence to the
    claim, that he was simply trying to get more time to pay the amount he owed,
    and that there was no merit to his request for a further adjournment.  </p>
