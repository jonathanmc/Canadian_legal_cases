  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Handguns and drug deals are frequent companions, but
    not good friends.  Rip-offs happen.  Shootings do too.  <i>Caveat
    emptor</i>.  <i>Caveat venditor</i>.  People get
    hurt.  People get killed.  Sometimes, the buyer.  Other times, the seller.  That happened here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jason Porter was a drug dealer. Everton Cribb and
    Allister Simon came to Porter’s house to buy one-half pound of marijuana.  Cribb and Simon brought handguns with
    them.  During a struggle, Cribb or Simon
    shot Porter once in the chest.  Porter
    died. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cribb pleaded guilty to manslaughter, <span
class=GramE>then</span> testified for the Crown at Simon’s trial.  A jury convicted Simon of second degree
    murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simon appeals his conviction.  He says that the trial judge made mistakes in
    his final instructions to the jury, by leaving some things out and getting
    other things wrong.  Simon also argues
    that he was improperly excluded from some discussions about the judge’s final
    instructions because those discussions took place in the judge’s chambers,
    rather than in open court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal
    and affirm the appellant’s conviction for second degree murder.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Everton
    Cribb and Michael Cieplucha met while both were inmates at Mimico Correctional
    Centre. They shared a fondness for hip-hop music and marijuana and became
    friends. Drug purchases were a staple of their conversations. Cribb was
    impressed by the quality of the marijuana Cieplucha brought to Mimico on
    weekends as he served his intermittent sentence.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Drug
    Purchase Inquiry</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly
    before noon on March 31, 2003, Cribb called Cieplucha.  Cribb had a “chunk of money” and wanted to
    buy one-half pound or more of the same quality of marijuana that he (Cribb) had
    enjoyed in Mimico. With the help of Cieplucha’s girlfriend, Vera Garcia, and
    Jason Porter’s girlfriend, Nicole Montreuil, a deal was struck to buy one-half
    pound of marijuana from Porter for $1300.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Trip to Hamilton</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the early evening of March 31, 2003, Cribb asked his girlfriend, Stacey Powell,
    whether she would drive him and the appellant to Hamilton.  Powell agreed.  En route to Porter’s home, which he shared
    with Montreuil, Powell also picked up Cieplucha and Garcia at their place in
    Hamilton.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the trip to Hamilton, both Cribb and the appellant seemed paranoid.  Cribb asked regularly whether anyone there
    [at Porter’s place] had a gun.  Cribb was
    armed with a .45 calibre grey-coloured handgun.  The appellant had a 380 mm. silver-plated handgun.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Inquiry</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Vera
    Garcia asked Everton Cribb to go into the Parker-Montreuil home with her.  Cribb wanted to know who was inside.  Garcia told him “it’s a girl”.  But when Cribb and Garcia went to the front
    door, it was Porter who answered and admitted them.  Porter then left the home to get the
    marijuana.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Cribb
    returned to the van.  Cieplucha remained
    in the van.  He noticed that both Cribb
    and the appellant became “extremely paranoid” each time a car passed by the van
    and house.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Return of Jason Porter</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>About
    ten minutes after he left, Porter returned home.  Cribb met Porter outside and the two men
    entered the house together.  A few
    minutes later, the appellant and Cieplucha went to the door.  Garcia and Montreuil let them into the house.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Porter
    and Cribb went into the kitchen to conclude their drug deal.  The appellant stood about three feet away
    from Porter and Cribb, just outside the kitchen area.  Cieplucha stayed in the front hall or living
    room.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Confrontation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    scuffle began in the kitchen. Porter and Cribb were wrestling over some
    marijuana. Porter yelled out to Joe MacIntosh for help. MacIntosh, who lived on
    the second floor, headed downstairs. According to some witnesses, the appellant
    had a handgun trained on both the combatants, Porter and Cribb.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Evidence
    about who shot Jason Porter varied.  Montreuil believed that Cribb was the shooter. The basis for her
    conclusion seemed to be that Cribb was the taller of the two men (Cribb and the
    appellant), at least taller than the man who was fighting with Porter.
    Cieplucha saw the appellant point a chrome-plated handgun at Porter, then at
    Cieplucha himself.  Cieplucha did not see
    who shot Porter.  Garcia also saw a
    silver-coloured gun, but could not recall whether it was in the hand of the
    appellant or that of Cribb.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Everton
    Cribb said that both he and the appellant had handguns with them because they
    were buying drugs from strangers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
    police searched the house after responding to a 911 call, they found no
    weapons, drugs or cash. The gun that fired the fatal bullet, a 380 mm.
    semi-automatic weapon, has never been found.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Cause
    of Death</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Jason
    Porter died from a gunshot wound to the chest.  The gun was fired from a distance of about six or seven feet, although
    the weapon could have been as close as one foot from the deceased.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the appellant, Mr. Lacy raises four grounds of appeal relating to the trial
    judge’s final instructions to the jury and a discrete ground alleging
    jurisdictional error in conducting a pre-charge conference in the appellant’s
    absence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    my purposes, I would reduce the complaints about the final instructions to three
    and paraphrase them in this way:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>i.          alleged
    error in permitting the jury to consider the appellant’s liability for murder
    as a party under s. 21(2) and in the substance of the instructions provided;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ii.         alleged
    error in the instructions on the recklessness component of the fault element in
    murder under s. 229(a)(ii); and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iii.       <span
class=GramE>alleged</span> error in failing to provide a <i>W.(D.) </i>instruction in connection with the evidence of Nicole
    Montreuil.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    convenient place to begin is with the complaints of errors and omissions in the
    charge to the jury.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground No. 1: Jury Instructions on Liability <span
class=GramE>Under</span> s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    complaint has two aspects. The first puts in issue the availability of
    s.&nbsp;21(2) as a basis upon which the appellant could be convicted of second
    degree murder.  The second claims
    prejudicial error in leaving liability upon too expansive a basis, one not
    permitted by the supreme law of Canada.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Instructions of the Trial Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his final instructions, the trial judge told the jury that they could find the
    appellant guilty of second degree murder on either of two bases:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>i.          as
    a principal, the shooter in an unlawful killing that was murder under s.
    229(a); or</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ii.         as
    a party under s. 21(2) to a murder committed by Cribb, as principal, in
    carrying out their common unlawful purpose of robbery or participating in an
    illegal drug transaction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge’s first reference to s. 21(2) did not go beyond the terms of the
    subsection, including a reference to objective foresight of the likely
    commission of the incidental or collateral crime. In this passage, the trial
    judge did not identify the “unlawful purpose” or the “offence”, thus did not
    tell the jury that objective foresight of murder was sufficient to establish
    the knowledge requirement for this basis of liability.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his second reference to s. 21(2) as a basis of liability, the trial judge
    separated out the essential elements of the subsection as</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>agreement</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>offence</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>knowledge</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge pointed out that this basis of liability was only
    available for consideration if they (or some of them) were satisfied that Cribb
    was the shooter.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his discussion of the element of “agreement”, a compendious term reflective of
    the statutory language, “an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
    purpose and to assist each other therein”, <span class=GramE>the</span> trial
    judge identified participation in an unlawful drug transaction and robbery as
    the underlying common unlawful purpose.  He indicated that the “offence” involved was second degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    completing his instructions on the “agreement” and “offence” elements of
    s.&nbsp;21(2), the trial judge turned to the “knowledge” requirement.  He said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to the third element, <i>knowledge</i>,
    it depends on the nature of the original planned offence which you find as a
    fact.  If you find, as a fact, the
    original planned offence was that of a robbery or a drug transaction in which
    either Cribb or Simon possessed a gun or Simon knew that Cribb had a gun and
    was prepared to use it to kill, then Crown counsel must prove that Allister
    Simon actually knew that Cribb would probably commit second degree murder in
    carrying out the original agreement.  Probably means likely, not just possibly.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span
lang=EN-US>Knowledge</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> is a state of mind, Mr. Simon’s
    state of mind.  To know something is to
    be aware of it.  Did Mr. Simon know that
    Everton Cribb would probably commit second degree murder in carrying out their
    original agreement?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>To
    determine what Allister Derrick Simon actually knew about the likelihood of
    Cribb committing second-degree murder in carrying out the original agreement
    you look at Mr. Simon’s words and conduct before, at the time and after the
    offence had been committed. All these things and the circumstances in which
    they occurred may shed light on Mr. Simon’s knowledge or otherwise of Everton
    Cribb’s commission of second degree murder. I would ask you to <span
class=GramE>use  your</span> common
    sense.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Positions of Counsel at Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge provided drafts of his final instructions to counsel from time to
    time as the trial continued.  He gave counsel
    the opportunity to review the various drafts and to make submissions about the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant was represented at trial by very experienced counsel who advanced his
    defence through vigorous cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.  With the benefit of the proposed instructions

    the appellant, Mr. Lacy advances two arguments about the trial judge’s
    instructions on s. 21(2).  His first
    complaint is that the subsection was left at all as an alternative basis of
    liability.  His second criticism has to
    do with the substance of what was said about the foresight or knowledge
    element.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Lacy readily acknowledges that the evidence showed that Cribb and the appellant
    went to Porter’s house to buy marijuana.  Each, to the knowledge of the other, was armed.  But the handguns were for protection.  They were buying marijuana from a dealer with
    whom they had not done business previously.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Lacy says that the trial record offers no evidence upon which a reasonable
    jury, properly instructed, could find that Cribb and the appellant had a common
    plan to rob Porter.  The only evidence
    about any armed or forceful taking of Porter’s property came from Cieplucha’s
    account of the scuffle in the kitchen when Porter had a bag of marijuana in his
    hand.  But the nub of Cieplucha’s
    evidence was that he could not say that what happened was a robbery – the
    appellant and Cribb were there to buy drugs.</span></p>

    for the substance of the instructions, in particular, those about the knowledge
    requirement in s. 21(2), Mr. Lacy contends that the inclusion of the “ought to
    have known” alternative in the trial judge’s first mention of the provision was
    at once wrong for the incidental crime of murder and never corrected in any
    further instructions. What was said later was too little, too late and was
    aggravated by the trial judge’s failure to repeat a correct s. 21(2)
    instruction in answer to the jury’s question about the definition of murder in
    s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).  </span></p>

    the respondent, Mr. McInnes is contrary-minded.  Section 21(2) was available as an alternative basis of liability. The
    evidence supported both common unlawful purposes identified by the trial
    judge.  And despite the initial slip in
    including “ought to have known” in his first recitation of the terms of s.
    21(2), which was only wrong in connection with the incidental crime of murder
    but not manslaughter, the instructions that followed made it clear that <i>actual</i> knowledge that the likelihood of
    an intentional killing was required before the appellant could be convicted of
    murder under s. 21(2).</span></p>

    McInnes points out that the evidentiary foundation critical to the application
    of s. 21(2) was in place for both common unlawful purposes identified by the
    trial judge.  The evidence that Cribb and
    the appellant went to Porter’s place to buy drugs was overwhelming.  And despite evidence denying the existence of
    any pre-formulated plan to rob, which the jury was free to reject, the evidence
    of what actually occurred furnished the wherewithal necessary to invoke s.
    21(2).</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The controlling legal principles spark little
    controversy between the parties.  The
    result of the application of those principles to the circumstances of this case
    is another matter.  A brief recapture of
    some of the principles that govern the application of s. 21(2) to the
    incidental crime of murder is all that is required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 21 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> abolishes the common law distinction between principals and secondary
    parties and renders all who participate in a crime in any manner described in
    the section parties to the offence.  Individual and joint or co-principals.  Aiders.  Abettors.  Participants in a common unlawful purpose or
    design: <i>R. v. Thatcher</i>, [1987] 1

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 21(1) and 21(2) are different. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Persons who participate in the offence <i>actually</i> committed, whether as a principal,
    an aider or an abettor, have their liability determined under s. 21(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 21(2) extends liability for crime in two
    respects.  The first has to do with the <i>persons</i> whose participation in an
    unlawful enterprise may attract liability.  And the second relates to the <i>offence</i> for which participants in an unlawful criminal enterprise may be held liable: <i>R. v. Simpson</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p.
    15; <i>R. v. Turkiewicz, Barrow and
    MacNamara</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 406 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 409; <i>R. v. Howard and <span class=GramE>Trudel <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>persons</i> to whom s. 21(2) extends liability are those whose participation in the offence
    actually committed would <i>not</i> be
    captured by s. 21(1).  These persons have
    participated in a prior unlawful enterprise with others and either knew or, in
    most cases at least, should have known that one (or more) of the other
    participants in the original enterprise would likely commit the offence charged
    in pursuing their original purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>offence</i> to which s. 21(2) extends liability is not the original “unlawful purpose” to
    which the subsection refers.  The
    “offence” of s. 21(2) is a different crime, one that a participant in the
    original “unlawful purpose” commits in carrying out that original purpose.  And so it is that we sometimes say that s.
    21(2) extends liability to those engaged in one unlawful purpose to incidental
    or collateral crimes: crimes committed by any participant (in the original
    purpose) in carrying out the original purpose that the other knew or should
    have known would likely be committed in pursuing the original purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 21(2), the liability of a party to a common
    unlawful purpose for an incidental crime committed by another participant
    requires proof of the party’s participation in the original unlawful purpose,
    the commission of the incidental crime by another participant and the required
    degree of foresight of the likelihood that the incidental crime will be
    committed.  Consistent with general
    principle, each of these essential elements, earlier described as “agreement”,
    “offence” and “knowledge”, must be supported by an adequate evidentiary record
    to warrant submission of this basis of liability to the jury.  What we require is some evidence on the basis
    of which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could make the findings of
    fact necessary to establish each element of this mode of participation: <i>R. v. Cinous</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 3, at
    para. 83; <i>R. v. Isaac</i>, [1984] 1
    S.C.R. 74, at p. 81; <i>R. v. Sparrow</i> (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 443 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 458.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A final point of governing principle has to do with the
    standard or scope of appellate review of jury instructions.  Those charged with crime are entitled to have
    their liability determined by properly instructed juries. We impose no
    requirement of perfection in jury instructions: <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at paras. 1-2<span
class=GramE>.  We</span> test the
    adequacy of jury instructions in a functional way, holding them up against the
    purpose they are required to fulfill: <i>Jacquard</i> at para. 32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate review is not the legal equivalent of a
    laboratory experiment.  Although a
    comparison to a post-mortem examination may be uncomfortably close, we do not
    dissect the final instructions, examine them every which way, find a misplaced
    word or ill-suited phrase and pronounce it the cause of death.  We examine the charge as a whole, together
    with the evidence given at trial, all of it, and the positions of the parties:<i> Jacquard</i> at para. 33; <i>R. v. Vézeau</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, at
    pp. 285-86.  An important, but not
    dispositive factor in determining whether appellate intervention is warranted
    is the failure of counsel to object to what is later advanced as prejudicial
    error: <i>Jacquard</i> at paras. 36-38; <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129,
    p. 143; <i>Thériault v. The Queen</i>,
    [1981] 1 S.C.R. 336, at pp. 343-44.</p>
  <h4>The Principles Applied</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal fails.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To take first the complaint that the trial judge erred
    in leaving s. 21(2) as a basis upon which the jury could convict the appellant
    of murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core of this complaint reduces to a submission that
    the trial record was barren of evidentiary support for what I have earlier
    described as the “agreement” requirement of s. 21(2), a compendious term for
    the statutory language “an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
    purpose”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither trial counsel nor Mr. Lacy suggested that
    participation in an unlawful drug transaction could not fall within the
    “unlawful purpose” requirement in the subsection.  Nor could there be any doubt about
    evidentiary support for such a finding.  Cribb wanted to buy drugs.  He and
    the appellant went to Porter’s house to buy one-half pound of marijuana.  Each, to the other’s knowledge, was armed
    with a handgun.  No need to go further to
    establish the evidentiary foundation for this “unlawful purpose”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence goes further.  Cribb entered Porter’s house first.  The appellant, in an agitated state and
    concerned about his “bro”, followed within minutes.  Very shortly a struggle began.  Guns came out.  The struggle continued.  Porter had a bag of “weed” in his hand during
    the struggle. A shot was fired.  A later
    search of the premises turned up neither drugs nor money.  No one saw any money produced or in the
    possession of Cribb or the appellant.  The cumulative effect of this evidence met the standard required to
    engage s. 21(2) as a basis of liability arising out of robbery as the
    underlying “unlawful purpose”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor would I give effect to the argument that the jury
    were misdirected, or at least confused, about the requirement that the
    appellant <i>actually</i> knew that Cribb
    would probably kill Porter in carrying out their original purpose of
    consummating a drug deal or committing robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his first mention of s. 21(2), the trial judge
    included the alternative “or ought to have known” in his instructions.  This version was unadorned by any reference
    to either the “unlawful purpose” or the “offence” that the judge would later
    describe.  In other words, neither the
    “unlawful purpose” of an illicit drug transaction or robbery, nor the <span
class=GramE>offence of murder were</span> mentioned.  More specifically, the jurors were never told
    that objective foresight of murder was a sufficient basis upon which to find
    guilt of murder under s. 21(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In each subsequent instruction in which the requirement
    of foresight was discussed in connection with the offence of murder, the trial
    judge made it clear that only <i>actual </i>knowledge
    of the likelihood that Cribb would commit murder would satisfy this essential
    element of s. 21(2). The instruction on liability for manslaughter under s.
    21(2) underscored the difference between the foresight required for murder and
    what is legally sufficient for manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read as a whole, I am satisfied that the final
    instructions on s. 21(2) as a basis upon which the jury could convict the
    appellant of murder were justified on the evidence and free of error.  Counsel for the appellant at trial apparently
    thought so as well.  He offered no
    objection to the charge in either respect.</p>

    gentlemen, for your question.  I have
    reviewed it with counsel and what I propose to do is read the following to you:
    “The crime of murder requires proof of a particular state of mind.  For an unlawful killing to be murder, Crown
    counsel must prove that the killer meant either to kill Jason Porter or meant
    to cause Jason Porter bodily harm that the killer knew was likely to kill Jason
    Porter and was reckless whether Jason Porter died or not.”  Now that last phrase could also be expressed
    in the following: “That the killer saw the risk that Jason Porter could die
    from the injury but went ahead, anyway, and took the chance.  The Crown does not have to prove both.  One is enough.  All of you do not have to agree on the same
    state of mind as long as everyone is sure that one of the required states of
    mind <span class=GramE>have</span> been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”  So, I’m going to leave that with you, and if

    defence counsel objected to the trial judge’s plain English paraphrase of the
    concluding words of s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), the trial judge
    recalled the jury.  Within five minutes
    of the original response, the trial judge offered a correction: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>THE
    COURT:  Okay. I’m sorry, folks, but I’ve
    just reflected on exactly what I’ve said and I don’t want there to be any
    misunderstandings. As I said to you, the crime of murder requires proof of a
    particular state of mind.  For an
    unlawful killing to be murder, Crown counsel must prove the killer meant either
    to kill Jason Porter or meant to cause Jason Porter bodily harm that the killer
    knew was likely to kill Jason Porter and was reckless whether Jason Porter died
    or not. I then made reference to an alternative phrase, but the alternative
    phrase was with respect to the word “reckless”.  For that, leaving aside the direct, the intent to kill – and when we’re
    talking, we have to think in terms of meant – the alternative is, “meant to
    cause Jason Porter bodily harm that the killer knew was likely to kill Mr.
    Porter [that’s a given] and was reckless …”.  Now, the substitute for “reckless” is, or the way of expressing reckless
    is that the killer saw the risk that Mr. Porter could die from the injury but
    went ahead and took the chance, but with that use of that expansion or
    definition of the word “reckless”, you still have to have the idea, or you have
    to find that the killer knew that the bodily harm that he was going to do was
    likely to kill Mr. Porter.  In other
    words, it’s not just the possibility, it’s a likelihood that it would kill him
    and, as I indicated to you before, the Crown does not have to prove both.  One is enough.  All of you do not have to agree on the same
    state of mind as long as everyone is sure that one of the required states of
    mind has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Thank you.  Sorry about that.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    this is not a case in which the original instructions, which track the language
    of the statutory provision, contain errors about the recklessness component of

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the error made relates to recklessness, not to either intention or knowledge
    that <i>Nygaard</i> teaches are the most
    critical components of the fault element that s.&nbsp;229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii)
    describes. The instructions about both intention and knowledge are unencumbered
    by error.  Further, from what I can
    determine from the instructions given about the decision tree, its language
    duplicated that of the statute.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    the error was immediately corrected.  The
    mistake was identified, described as an error, and corrected.  The correction attracted no objection, either
    on the ground that it was erroneous or that it would be confusing to the jury.</span></p>

    addition to the subservient role of recklessness in the fault element in
    s.&nbsp;229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), we should not lose sight of the
    evidence in this case.  A gunshot from a
    handgun of significant calibre, fired from a distance of not more than six or
    seven feet, perhaps as close as one foot from the deceased.  A wound to a vital part of the deceased.  And no suggestion of any incapacitating
    elements, such as intoxication, whether the shooter was Cribb or the appellant.

    her belief on her impression that the shooter was the taller of the two men who
    had entered her home.  She did not

    time as the shooter, rather identified Cribb as the shooter at the preliminary
    inquiry.  Her evidence was that the
    shooter was the taller of the two men.  Cribb is three inches taller than the appellant.  This significant evidence of
    “non-identification” warranted a <i>W. (D.) </i>instruction.  Failure to give it, or to convey the same
    message in different words, is fatal to the validity of the conviction.</span></p>

    purpose of a <i>W. (D.) </i>instruction, Mr.
    McInnes says, is to ensure that the jurors understand the relationship between
    determinations of credibility, on the one hand, and the prosecution’s burden of
    proof on the other.  The instruction further
    ensures that the jury does not decide the case simply by choosing between
    competing versions of events.</span></p>

    not one of credibility, rather one that had to do with the reliability of her

    the alternative basis of liability for which s. 21(2) provides.  A <i>W.

    accused beyond a reasonable doubt: <i>R. v.
    S. (J.H.)</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para. 8.  General instructions on reasonable doubt, without adverting to its
    relationship to the credibility (or lack of credibility) of the witnesses,
    leaves open too great a possibility of confusion or misunderstanding in the
    minds of the jurors:  <i>S. (J.H.)</i> at para. 8.  </span></p>

    the prosecution’s ultimate burden of proof is provided in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at pp. 757-58. But the
    frequently invoked passage contains a <i>caveat</i> of no little importance: failure to parrot the precise language of Cory J. is
    not fatal, provided the charge, when read as a whole, makes it clear that the
    jury could not have laboured under any misapprehension about the controlling
    burden and standard of proof that governed their deliberations and decision: <i>W. (D.)</i> at p. 758.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    (D.)</i></span> is not some ceremonial chant or magic incantation that must be
    uttered on pain of immediate and unmitigated appellate censure.  Substance <span class=GramE>triumphs,</span> not form.  And the substance that must be
    delivered is that the burden of proof rests upon the Crown, never shifts (at
    least almost never), and requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every
    essential element before a finding of guilt can be made: <i>S. (J.H.) </i>at para. 13.  Under
    no circumstances are the terms used by the trial judge to leave the impression
    that the jury must choose between two competing versions of events: <i>R. v. Avetysan</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at
    para. 19; <i>S. (J.H.) </i>at para. 13.  Further, the jury must understand that an
    accused’s lack of credibility is not the equivalent of proof beyond a

    at once exculpatory and incompatible with the rendition provided by prosecution
    witnesses. Absent an appropriate instruction, the risk of resolution by simple
    comparative choice is at its most palpable. But it is not in every case of

    fired as Porter and another man struggled with one another.  Porter had a bag of marijuana in his

    one reason or another, evidence about the identity of the shooter varied among
    the several occupants of the house.  The
    trial judge instructed the jury that the appellant could be found guilty of

lang=EN-US>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    nucleus of the appellant’s claim of error in the trial judge’s failure to give
    a <i>W. (D.) </i>or <i>W. (D.)-</i>like instruction in connection with the evidence of Nicole

    exculpatory of the appellant. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    what is crucial is that the jury not be left with the impression, either from
    what the trial judge said or left unsaid, that it had to choose from
    conflicting versions of events.  Further,
    the jury must not have been left with any misapprehension about the correct
    burden and standard of proof to apply.  Nothing said or left unsaid here, expressly or by necessary implication,
    invited a decision based on an enforced choice between conflicting
    alternatives, misplaced the onus or diminished the standard of proof.</span></p>

    in the circumstances of this case, to segregate the evidence of Montreuil and
    to single it out for a separate instruction is at once to ignore the realities
    of the evidence adduced at trial and to fail to appreciate that the appellant’s
    liability did not rest entirely upon his participation as the principal, the
    shooter who actually caused the death of the deceased. An instruction of the
    nature suggested was of no moment to a determination of the appellant’s
    liability under s. 21(2).  A reasonable
    doubt about the appellant’s participation as the shooter would not require his
    acquittal.</span></p>

    the trial judge’s instructions made it clear that if the jurors had a
    reasonable doubt about the appellant’s participation as the shooter and as a
    party under s.&nbsp;21(2), they were to acquit. They were told, and more than
    once, that to find the appellant guilty of second degree murder, the Crown must
    satisfy them of all the essential elements of that offence beyond a reasonable
    doubt, whether the appellant’s participation was as the shooter or as a party

lang=EN-US>The chambers discussion took place

lang=EN-US>Trial counsel indicated that, in his
    experience, it was not uncommon in 2005 for pre-charge conferences to be held
    in the trial judge’s chambers. He intended to summarize what had taken place in
    chambers when the proceedings resumed on the record the following day, but
    failed to do so.  When he suggested the
    in chambers discussion, he did not take into account the requirements of s. 650
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, nor did he seek
    specific instructions from the appellant before participating in the chambers
    discussions.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>5.         When I suggested going into chambers
    and agreed to do so later, I did not specifically turn my mind to s. 650 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. I did not specifically
    seek instructions from the client on that issue.  I would have presented the issue to Mr. Simon
    as being part of the usual course of affairs in a trial and would not have told
    him that he could withhold consent for discussions to proceed in chambers.  Nor did I <span class=GramE>tell  him</span> if he did not consent, that the
    discussion would not take place in chambers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Trial counsel for the appellant made
    no notes of what occurred in the pre-charge discussions in chambers.  He described his recollection, nearly four
    years later, in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>6.         I do not recall exactly how long we
    were in chambers “off the record”. It seems to <span class=GramE>me,</span> having reviewed the transcript excerpt, that it was likely that it was no more
    than 20 to 30 minutes and the discussion would have been limited to discussing
    the appropriate charge to be given to the jury on the state of mind required
    for the different levels of culpability for homicide.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>7.         Although the trial Crown had indicated
    that going into chambers was necessary so that Mr. Simon would not hear what we
    discussed, I recall specifically disclosing to Mr. Simon the substance of the
    discussions in chambers.  I would have
    summarized the anticipated legal instruction on the issues of the state of mind
    for manslaughter and the state of mind for murder.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>8.         The issue of the appropriate state of
    mind for murder, manslaughter and a finding of innocence was an important one
    in the context of Mr. Simon’s case.  The
    Crown had made a pre-trial offer for Mr. Simon to plead guilty to manslaughter
    and that issue was one that was canvassed with Mr. Simon.  The issue was also an important one in the
    context of whether Mr. Simon would ultimately testify at the trial or not.</span></p>

    the proposed instructions took place in open court in the appellant’s presence
    on December 7, 8, 9 and 12, 2005.  The

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For the appellant, Mr. Lacy submits
    that the conduct of the pre-charge conference in chambers in the appellant’s
    absence breached s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>and cannot be forgiven by s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Lacy says that, apart from
    inapplicable exceptions, s. 650(1) required the appellant’s presence in court
    throughout his trial. The purposes underlying this requirement are the right of
    each person on trial to hear the case against them and to provide them with the
    opportunity to respond to it, and the right of an accused to acquire first-hand
    knowledge of the proceedings in a fair and open process.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>To determine whether something that
    happened in the course of a trial was part of the “trial” for the purposes of
    s. 650(1) requires an examination of whether what occurred affected the “vital
    interests” of the accused.  No one can
    gainsay that what was discussed here, the contents of final jury instructions,
    affected the vital interests of the appellant.  These discussions had a direct bearing on the basis upon which his
    liability would be left to the jury, an important factor for counsel and for the
    appellant to consider in deciding whether the appellant should testify.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[110]<span

lang=EN-US>Mr. Lacy takes the position that s.
    686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv) cannot salvage what occurred here.  The appellant did not consent to the conduct
    of the conference in his absence, nor was he adequately apprised of what
    occurred there. The fairness of the trial was compromised beyond redemption.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For the respondent, Mr. McInnes
    begins with the submission that the preliminary nature of the in chambers
    discussions removes them from the requirement of the appellant’s presence under
    s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The
    subsequent in-court conferences confirm the preliminary nature of the in
    chambers discussions.  Nothing was
    decided about charge content in chambers.  What occurred was a canvass of potential subjects.  No drafts were proffered.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. McInnes also advances an
    alternative argument in the event that we determine that what occurred in
    chambers was part of the “trial” for the purposes of s. 650(1).  He contends that what occurred falls within
    the sanctuary provided by s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. McInnes points out that it was
    trial counsel for the appellant who suggested the pre-charge conference take
    place in chambers. The discussions were preliminary only.  The decision not to call a defence did not
    occur until much later and preceded the more fulsome discussions about modes of
    participation and the basis upon which the appellant’s liability would be
    determined.  Neither the actual nor the
    apparent fairness of the trial was compromised by the chambers discussion.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Section 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires that, apart from
    some exceptions that have no place here, an accused must be “present in court
    during the whole of his … trial”. Apart from the obvious, such as the
    introduction of evidence before the jury, counsel’s addresses and the trial
    judge’s charge, not everything that happens during a trial is part of the
    “trial” for the purposes of s. 650(1) and, thereby the requirement that the
    accused be present: <i>R. v. Hertrich</i>, <i>Stewart and Skinner</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C.
    (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 529; <i>R. v.

lang=EN-US>The watershed case on what
    constitutes part of the “trial” for the purposes of the presence requirement in
    s. 650(1) is the decision in <i>Hertrich</i>.  There, Martin J.A. made it clear that the
    term “trial” in s. 650(1) reaches beyond those proceedings that form part of
    the procedure established for determining guilt or innocence and the imposition
    of the sentence to include at least some proceedings conducted by the judge
    during the trial for the purpose of investigating things that have occurred
    outside the trial but may affect its fairness: <i>Hertrich</i> at pp. 527-537.</span></p>

    conduct of the trial”: <i>Hertrich </i>at p.

    650(1), especially if the discussion is of a preliminary nature, does not
    involve any final determination and is recounted in open court in the presence

lang=EN-US>Section 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> came into force
    on December 4, 1985.  Its real focus
    seems to have been to inter the jurisprudence that regarded procedural errors
    that caused trial courts to lose jurisdiction as incurable, even on appeal: <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at

    asked of him while he was testifying on his own behalf.  After the issue had been settled, the accused
    and the jury returned to the courtroom. The question that had attracted the
    exclusion was rephrased by the prosecutor and asked again.  The trial continued.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court identified three types of error that could

    errors in the first category.  They do
    apply to the second category, but much of the heavy lifting there can be done
    by its older sibling, s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iii). Section 686(1<span

    salvaged by the application of the proviso in s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv)
    requires a consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  If the in chambers discussion was part of the
    trial, a subject about which reasonable people may differ, I would apply the
    provisions of s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv) to the procedural error
    in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The in chambers discussions in this case took place
    before the prosecution’s case had been completed and well in advance of the
    time at which the appellant was required to make his final decision about
    whether he would testify in response to the prosecution’s case.  The discussions in open court that <span
class=GramE>preceded</span> the retirement to chambers consisted of a review of
    a list of items that might be worthy of inclusion in the charge.  No discussion about the substance of the
    instructions took place. No drafts were offered. The discussions of substance
    occurred later, in open court, after counsel had received copies of the
    proposed instructions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is much to be said for the conclusion that the
    preliminary nature of the in chambers discussions in this case were not part of
    the “trial” for the purposes of s. 650(1), any more than the preliminary
    discussion of the response to the jury’s question was part of the “trial” in <i>Dunbar</i> or in <i>T. (L.W.)</i>.  However, I need
    not come to a firm conclusion about whether this case comes within the
    “preliminary discussion” exception of <i>Dunbar </i>because I regard it as a case for the application of the proviso in
    s.&nbsp;686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv).  My reasons are several.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the proposal to conduct the pre-charge
    conference in controversy here originated with counsel for the appellant at
    trial.  At first, the trial judge
    demurred.  While it was for the trial
    judge to decide where the discussions would take place, the immediate response
    of trial counsel for the appellant, “to chambers” can scarcely be ignored when
    considering the applicability of the proviso.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as what took place before and after the
    chambers interlude reveal, what occurred there was preliminary to the
    discussions of substance that took place later after drafts of the proposed
    instructions had been circulated to counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, according to his affidavit, trial counsel for
    the appellant specifically disclosed to the appellant the substance of the
    chambers discussions and “would have summarized” the anticipated legal
    instructions on the fault elements of murder and manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, any discussion that occurred in chambers did
    not result in any determination about the substance of final instructions.  Those discussions occurred later, in court,
    in the presence of the appellant after circulation of draft instructions to
    counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the record belies any suggestion that what
    occurred in chambers exerted any influence on any tactical or other decision
    made by the defence in its conduct of the case.  Nothing said or done altered the evidentiary landscape of the trial or
    the manner in which the balance of the case unfolded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exclusion of the appellant from the brief
    pre-charge discussion held outside the courtroom was inadvertent, heedless of
    the requirements of s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code.  </i>None of the participants seems
    to have considered that in chambers discussions about the subjects to be
    included in final instructions affect an accused’s “vital interests” in the
    proceedings, thus may engage s. 650(1) under <i>Hertrich</i> and later authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pre-charge conferences to discuss the contents of final
    instructions in a jury case have been the practice in this province for several
    decades.  Prior to the enactment of
    s.&nbsp;650.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    which was proclaimed in force on June 16, 1997, the authority to conduct these
    conferences was an incident of the common law authority to manage the conduct
    of a trial.  In my experience, both
    before and after the proclamation of s. 650.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, pre-charge conferences in the superior court of
    criminal jurisdiction have been and are held in open court, in the absence of
    the jury, but in the presence of the accused and on the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Affirmation of the appellant’s conviction in this case
    ought not to be taken as approval of the practice of conducting preliminary
    parts of pre-charge conferences in chambers.  Nothing could depart further from reality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pre-charge conference affects the vital interests
    of an accused.  Under s.&nbsp;650.1 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, these conferences
    are to discuss “the matters that should be explained to the jury and with
    respect to the choice of instructions to the jury”.  The elements of the offence.  The modes of participation.  Available defences, justifications and
    excuses.  These subjects are of vital
    concern to an accused.  That these
    conferences are part of the “trial” for the purposes of s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, at least to the extent
    that they go beyond some preliminary matters, seems inescapable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 650.1 says nothing about the manner in which
    the pre-charge conference is to be conducted or its location.  And it does say “confer with the accused or
    counsel for the accused”.  But, s. 650(1)
    remains and the references to “the accused or counsel for the accused” may well
    have been inserted to ensure that these conferences are also conducted in cases
    where the accused is self-represented.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge faxed drafts of his
    proposed instructions to counsel for their review.  I see nothing wrong with this or other
    electronic methods of getting draft instructions into the hands of counsel at
    various times during the trial. But electronic exchange of submissions in
    response to the drafts may be problematic for the same reasons that the in
    chambers pre-charge conference nearly invalidated the appellant’s
    conviction.  The courtroom is the place
    for discussion.  On the record.  In the presence of the accused.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
