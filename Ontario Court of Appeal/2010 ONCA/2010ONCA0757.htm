  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that he was denied a fair trial
    as he was unfairly put to trial without legal representation or <i>amicus curiae</i> and because the trial judge
    failed to adequately assist him during the trial as an unrepresented accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view the trial judge did not err in proceeding
    with the trial despite the appellant’s failure to be represented by
    counsel.  By the time the trial
    commenced, the trial had been before the Superior Court for almost two
    years.  During this period he had, at
    various times, been represented by three different lawyers and there had been
    some 17 appearances to set dates, hold a pre-trial and for various adjournments
    of the trial date to allow the appellant to retain new counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last of the lawyers to represent the appellant was
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Zenobio</span> who successfully applied to be removed
    from the record a little over two months before the trial was scheduled to
    commence.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Zenobio</span> sought to be removed from the record as the appellant had filed a complaint
    against him with the Law Society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the assignment court held in the week before the
    trial was scheduled to commence, the appellant confirmed that he had a legal
    aid certificate but he advised the court that he had yet to locate a lawyer available
    to represent him on the scheduled trial dates.  The judge asked whether he wished to seek an adjournment to allow him
    time to retain counsel or wished to proceed with the trial unrepresented.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant clearly expressed his desire to
    be represented at trial, he was equally insistent that he did not want to delay
    the trial further.  He had been in
    custody for more than two and a half years and was still in custody at that
    time.  In the end, the appellant said
    “let’s get the show on the road”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial the following week, the Crown introduced an
    application to appoint counsel for the appellant for the limited purpose of
    cross-examining the complainant.  The
    appellant initially objected and said that he wanted counsel appointed for the
    whole of the trial.  In the course of
    submissions on the application, the trial judge was struggling to understand
    what the appellant was asking for.  In
    the end, the appellant consented to the Crown’s application and appeared
    content to proceed with the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then adjourned the trial for five days
    to allow the appellant to review disclosure and, thereafter, the trial
    proceeded as scheduled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we see no error in the trial
    judge proceeding with the trial.  The
    appellant was in possession of a legal aid certificate and could have retained
    counsel had he been prepared to seek further adjournment.  The appellant however clearly preferred to
    proceed without counsel rather than spending additional time in custody
    awaiting trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second basis for the appeal is that the trial judge
    did not provide sufficient assistance to the appellant in the course of the
    trial.  There is no issue as to the
    adequacy of the trial judge’s assistance at the outset of the trial.  At the outset, the trial judge explained the
    trial process, the elements of the offence and other concepts such as
    continuity, a <span class=SpellE><i>voir</i></span><i> dire</i> and the police officer’s use of
    his notes to refresh his memory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concerns raised are that the trial judge did not
    provide adequate assistance with respect to a number of specific matters that
    arose in the course of the trial.  On the
    central issue of the trial, being a cross-examination of the complainant on the
    issue of credibility, the appellant had the benefit of counsel appointed by the
    court.  Arguably the trial judge could,
    at various points of time, have explained matters in greater detail.  However, we note that when the trial judge
    did offer assistance, the appellant was either resistant or simply did not
    follow the advice he was given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When viewed as a whole, we are not persuaded that on
    the facts of this case the manner in which the trial was conducted and
    assistance provided resulted in an unfair trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  </p>
