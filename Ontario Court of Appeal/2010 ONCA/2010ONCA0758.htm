style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals against his conviction by Haines J. on the charge

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
    The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  First, he submits that the trial
    judge erred in admitting evidence of prior consistent statements and then using
    those statements to bolster the credibility of the complainant.  Second, he
    submits that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the complainant’s
    evidence, in particular, the manner in which he resolved serious
    inconsistencies in her evidence.  For the following reasons, the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Prior Consistent Statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During examination-in-chief, Crown counsel led evidence from the
    complainant of statements she made to school friends during the years that she
    said the abuse took place and a complaint that she made to her grandmother that
    led to the authorities being notified and the charges being laid.  The
    appellant does not question the admissibility of the latter evidence or the use
    the trial judge made of it.  The only issue is the admissibility and use of the
    statements to the school friends.  There was no objection at trial by defence
    counsel (not Mr. Breen) to the admission of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Generally, it is not open to Crown counsel to lead evidence of prior
    consistent statements from a complainant during her examination-in-chief. 
    Statements such as those made by the complainant, in this case to her school
    friends, which were made many years before the complaint was made that led to
    charges being laid, are not admissible as narrative in accordance with this
    court’s decision in <i>R. v. F. (J.E.)</i> (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 1.  Ordinarily,
    it is not open to the Crown to lead evidence of prior consistent statements simply
    in anticipation that the defence may allege recent fabrication: see <i>R. v. R.
    (S.)</i> (1992), 8 O.R. (2d) 679 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, we are satisfied that the evidence was properly
    admitted.  We attach considerable weight in that respect to defence counsel’s
    failure to object.  It became clear within minutes of the cross-examination of
    the complainant that it was a theory of the defence that the complainant made
    these allegations as part of the group dynamic at school.  Essentially, the
    defence alleged that in order to feel included and accepted by her schoolmates,
    the complainant made the allegations against her father, the appellant.  Thus,
    it was inevitable that evidence of the statements would be elicited from the
    complainant to support the appellant’s defence.  Once the statements were
    properly admitted for that purpose, they were also available for other
    legitimate purposes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as the case developed, the statements were admissible to rebut
    an allegation of recent fabrication made by the defence during
    cross-examination of the complainant.  Around the time that the complaint was
    made to the grandmother, the complainant’s mother became ill.  The complainant
    was questioned to the effect that she made the complaint against the appellant
    so that she could live with her mother in the city, despite her mother’s
    illness, rather than in the country with her father.  The fact that the
    complainant had made prior statements to her school friends before this motive
    to fabricate arose was admissible to rebut the suggestion of recent
    fabrication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge did not misuse the evidence of prior
    statements.  He made only passing reference to it in his reasons, noting that
    the Crown relied on the complainant’s statements to school friends to rebut the
    allegation of recent fabrication.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that, since evidence to support the group
    dynamic theory had been introduced, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to
    deal with that evidence expressly.  The difficulty with that submission on this
    record is that it appears that by the end of the case, the defence had
    abandoned the group dynamic theory.  Certainly, it played no part in defence
    counsel’s final submissions, which focused entirely on the alleged
    inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence.  The appellant has not alleged
    ineffective assistance of counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Inconsistencies in the Complainant’s Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to adequately
    deal with inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony.  There is no question
    that the trial judge recognized that there were some inconsistencies in the
    complainant’s testimony.  The submission is, however, that the trial judge
    erred in the way that he resolved them.  Some of the alleged inconsistencies
    were relatively minor and could be explained by the complainant’s young age at
    the time the incidents occurred or by uncertainty as to the exact timing of
    events.  An example is provided by the sofa incident.  The complainant
    testified to a particular incident when she and the appellant were going to
    purchase or pick up a sofa.  The appellant’s partner testified that she was
    present on these trips with the appellant and the complainant and that no sexual
    incident occurred.  The trial judge resolved this issue by finding that the
    complainant was referring to another trip, other than when the appellant’s
    partner was present.  There was a basis in the evidence for this finding.  In
    particular, the appellant’s partner claimed that the second trip took place
    after the appellant’s arrest.  She was obviously in error, because after the
    arrest, the appellant had no further contact with the complainant.  The
    important point, however, is that even on the evidence of the appellant’s
    partner, more than one sofa-related trip took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another inconsistency concerned the so-called “Niagara Falls incident”. 
    Again, it was the appellant’s partner who claimed to have been present during
    the conversation.  She testified that the appellant did not make the sexual
    comments attributed to him by the complainant.  The trial judge resolved this
    apparent inconsistency by finding that the appellant’s partner was not present
    for the entire conversation.  This, too, was a finding that was open to him on
    the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most serious inconsistency concerned the evidence of the
    complainant’s friend, A.R.  A.R. testified that in grade two and grade seven,
    the complainant told her about inappropriate behaviour by the appellant.  According
    to A.R., the complainant told her that the appellant would touch the
    complainant’s leg under the dinner table and then move his hand toward her
    vagina.  In her testimony, the complainant denied that there were any such
    incidents and said that she told A.R. about some of the incidents as recounted
    in her testimony.  The trial judge resolved that issue as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Again, I do not find this difference to be
    particularly significant.  [A.R.] testified they were in grade two when the
    subject was first raised and my impression from [A.R.’s] testimony was that she
    was not very sure of the particulars of what she was told by [the complainant]
    at that time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this was a finding the trial judge was entitled to make. 
    A.R.’s testimony was vague as to what she was actually told.  For example, she
    testified that when the complainant told her, in grade two, about the
    appellant’s conduct, it did not make an impression on her.  When they discussed
    it again in grade seven, A.R. simply described the conversation as, “She told
    me pretty much the same thing she told me in second grade... Like she just told
    me what her dad did, like giving her looks and things like that?”  Finally, at
    one point A.R. testified that she did not remember exactly what the complainant
    said.  Given the vagueness and admitted uncertainties in A.R.’s recollection of
    the complainant’s disclosures, we see no error in the way in which the trial
    judge resolved the inconsistency in question.  We would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would dismiss the conviction appeal.</p>
