  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants were charged with a number of serious
    offences arising out of a home invasion motivated by the mistaken belief that
    the home owners were operating a marijuana “grow op” and had a great deal of
    cash in the home.  The appellant, Ranger,
    appeals conviction only.  The appellant,
    Fijalkowski, appeals conviction and sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s case rested in large measure on <i>K.G.B.</i> statements given by two persons,
    who had participated in the home invasion, pled guilty and been sentenced prior
    to this trial.  Both witnesses recanted
    their <i>K.G.B.</i> statements at trial,
    however, the statements were admitted on consent under the principled exception
    to the hearsay rule.  Both witnesses were
    thoroughly disreputable and the trial judge, quite properly, gave himself a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.  The appellants did not testify.  </p>
  <h3>The Arguments</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that the verdicts are
    unreasonable.  They contend that given
    the obvious and numerous problems with the credibility of the two <i>K.G.B.</i> witnesses, it was unreasonable to
    accept the contents of the <i>K.G.B.</i> statements as true and to find that the Crown had satisfied the burden of proof
    based on the contents of those statements.  <span class=GramE>Counsel for the appellants have</span> taken us
    through inconsistencies between the two <i>K.G.B.</i> statements and inconsistencies between those statements and other independent facts
    that were proved in evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel responds by accepting that the two <i>K.G.B.</i> witnesses were liars and
    thoroughly disreputable individuals.  She
    points out, however, the many consistencies between the two <i>K.G.B.</i> statements on important and
    specific details with respect to the events culminating in the home
    invasion.  She also submits that there is
    no evidence of any possible collusion between these two witnesses prior to the
    giving of the <i>K.G.B.</i> statements.  Finally, Crown counsel points to
    consistencies between the <i>K.G.B. </i>statements
    and other evidence adduced at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is merit to the arguments of both the appellant
    and the Crown.  No doubt, similar
    arguments were made at trial.  Our
    inquiry is, however, to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact, properly
    instructed, could convict and not to choose the more compelling of the
    arguments made for and against conviction.  In our view, the evidence clears the reasonable verdict standard.  We would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Mr. Ranger also argues that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence in several respects.  He took us through a number of examples.  In our view, none merit reversal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some of the alleged misapprehensions do not arise out
    of the trial judge’s review of the evidence at all, but rather address
    inferences that the trial judge indicated may or may not be available from
    parts of the evidence.  In this part of
    his reasons, the trial judge was not reviewing the evidence, but was addressing
    defence arguments concerning inferences that should be drawn from some of the
    evidence.  The trial judge was pointing
    out other inferences that were available on that evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other alleged misapprehensions of the evidence arise
    out of the trial judge’s reference to parts of the evidence that he ultimately
    rejected.  For example, it would appear
    that the trial judge misapprehended part of the in-court testimony of one of
    the <i>K.G.B.</i> witnesses.  However, the trial judge totally rejected
    that testimony for reasons that had nothing to do with any misapprehension of
    the substance of the testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, with respect to the other alleged
    misapprehensions of the evidence, a review of the entirety of the reasons
    dispels any concerns that the trial judge made any material error in respect of
    the evidence.  For example, while it is
    arguable that his summary of the evidence concerning Ranger’s cell phone use
    was somewhat inaccurate, the trial judge had, moments earlier in his reasons,
    correctly reviewed that evidence in detail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that any mistakes that the trial judge
    made in his review of the evidence were not material to the verdict and do not
    give cause to question the reliability of the verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also argue that the trial judge failed
    to consider the cumulative effect of parts of the evidence that supported the
    position of the defence.  Counsel contend
    that the trial judge looked at each of these potentially exculpatory portions
    of the evidence in isolation and after deciding that each piece of the evidence
    could not in and of itself raise a reasonable doubt, rejected the defence
    position with respect to that evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the trial judge addressed the parts of
    the evidence relied on by the defence separately.  He did so to properly outline those arguments
    and thoroughly address them before rejecting the defence position with respect
    to each.  It is clear, however, from an
    examination of the reasons as a whole that the trial judge applied the proper
    burden of proof and applied it to the totality of the evidence.  This ground of appeal cannot succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also submit that the trial judge erred
    in taking judicial notice that certain cell phones were being operated in various
    geographical locations at different times.  The Crown adduced business records on consent that detailed the
    operation of various cell phones that were owned by the appellants and one of
    the accomplices.  The records also showed
    the cell phone tower to which the signal from a particular phone was
    transmitted in respect of each call.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that without expert evidence,
    he could take judicial notice of the approximate location of a cell phone at the
    time a particular call was made based on the cell phone tower that received the
    signal.  Similarly, he could plot the
    directional movement of a cell phone over a particular time period by reference
    to the location of the <span class=GramE>different  cell</span> phone towers that received signals
    from that cell phone during that time period.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept that the trial judge erred in ruling
    that he could take judicial notice of the facts outlined above without hearing
    expert evidence.  The trial judge used
    the cell phone evidence for very limited purposes.  First, he used the evidence to show
    association among the parties.  This use
    is not challenged on appeal.  Second, by
    taking judicial notice of the facts set out above, the trial judge used the
    evidence to show the approximate geographical location of the cell phones in
    relation to the cell phone tower that received the transmission.  He did not take judicial notice that the cell
    phone was in any precise location, but rather that it could properly be placed
    in a general location, <i>e.g.</i> in
    downtown Ottawa as opposed to in the countryside west of Ottawa.  The trial judge’s further inference with
    respect to the movement of the cell phones over a given period of time followed
    from his determination that judicial notice could be taken of the general
    location of the cell phone based on the cell phone tower that received a
    particular transmission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that the appellants concede that it is now notorious
    that cell phone users engaged in a cell phone call and travelling from point A
    to point B will find their cell phone signal passes from one cell phone tower
    to another at different locations along the route from point A to point B.  We agree with and accept that
    concession.  Given that concession, we do
    not think it can be argued that the trial judge erred in taking judicial notice
    that a particular cell phone was in a general location based on the tower that
    received the signal and that the path along which the cell phone was moving
    could be determined by reference to the cell phone towers that received the
    signal transmission in respect of particular calls.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In holding that the trial judge made no error by ruling
    that he did not require expert evidence on this issue and that he could take
    judicial notice, we stress that the Crown was seeking to use the cell phone
    evidence only to show the approximate location of the users and movement of the
    users in a certain direction between locations.  In another case, the Crown may seek to rely on this kind of evidence for
    more specific or precise inferences.  The
    defence may also satisfy the court that more specific or detailed inferences
    are relevant to the issues raised by the cell phone evidence.  In those cases, the trial judge will require the
    Crown to lead the expert evidence necessary to address the more specific
    inferences that the Crown or the defence argue can or cannot be drawn from the
    evidence.  On the specific facts of this
    case, the trial judge correctly determined that judicial notice could be taken
    of the general propositions outlined above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above, the appeals from
    conviction are dismissed.</p>
  <h3>The Sentence Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Mr. Fijalkowski, appeals his sentence of
    10 years.  Mr. Ranger received a sentence
    of 9 years after trial while Messrs. Barkley and Trepanier received 7 years and
    Mr. Crosby received 4 years following their guilty pleas.  They also received credit for pre-trial
    custody.  We think the trial judge erred
    in law by imposing a sentence on Mr. Fijalkowski that was higher than the
    sentence imposed on Mr. Ranger.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge failed to take into account the
    significant disparity between both the length and the seriousness of the adult
    criminal records of Mr. Fijalkowski and Mr. Ranger.  Second, although the trial judge adverted to
    the fact that Mr. Fijalkowski was 20 years old, he did not address the
    significance or effect on sentence of the fact that he is a man four years
    younger than Mr. Ranger and of the age of only 20 years.  Third, the trial judge gave undue effect to
    his view that the appellant was not a good candidate for long term
    rehabilitation based only on one transgression in leaving Harvest House while
    on release and in the face of an apparently positive report from that
    institution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in his reasons for judgment, the trial judge
    concluded that on the evidence, he could not make findings of the respective roles
    of Mr. Fijalkowski and Mr. Ranger in the home invasion.  Given that finding, the trial judge could not
    impose a higher sentence on Mr. Fijalkowski based on any greater role he may
    have played.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, an appropriate sentence for Mr.
    Fijalkowski that would adequately reflect the above considerations and the
    parity principle is 8 years.  The appeal
    against sentence is, therefore, allowed and the sentence reduced to 8 years
    minus credit for pre-sentence custody.</p>
