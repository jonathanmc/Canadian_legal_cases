  <p><b>By the Court:</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Ngo and Mr. Mohamed, the appellants, were charged
    with offences relating to the possession of three firearms and two over
    capacity pistol magazines.  The firearms
    and magazines were found wrapped in a bundle of t-shirts (the “bundle”) on the
    floor of the front passenger’s side of an automobile.  One magazine clip was inserted in the handle
    of one of the firearms.    On the Crown’s case, Mr. Mohamed and Mr. Ngo
    were in that automobile shortly before the confrontation with the police that
    eventually led to the search of the automobile and the discovery of the
    firearms and magazines.  According to the
    Crown witness, Mr. Mohamed had been seated in the driver’s seat and Mr. Ngo was
    seated in the front passenger’s seat.  What
    appeared to be part of one of the firearms (actually one of the magazines) was
    plainly visible from either the front passenger’s seat or the driver’s seat of
    the vehicle.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury found the appellants guilty of the offences
    relating to the possession of the firearms, but not guilty of the offences
    relating to the possession of the over capacity magazines.  Mr. Ngo, a youthful first offender, was
    sentenced to two years’ incarceration.  Mr. Mohamed, a repeat offender, received an effective sentence of nine
    years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both appellants appeal their convictions.  Mr. Mohamed also seeks leave to appeal
    sentence and appeals sentence if leave is granted.  He submits that the sentence was excessive,
    particularly having regard to the sentence imposed on Mr. Ngo.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Ngo advances four grounds of appeal.  First, he submits that the jury’s verdicts
    are inconsistent.  Second, he submits
    that the trial judge erred in failing to seek clarification of and adequately
    respond to a question asked by the jury during its deliberations.  Third, counsel submits that the trial judge
    erred in instructing the jury that it must choose between two conflicting
    versions of events given by two Crown witnesses.  The appellant submits that this instruction
    undermined the previous <i>W<span
class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> instruction.  Fourth, the appellant submits the trial judge erred by dismissing a
    mistrial application based on an allegedly improper cross-examination of Mr.
    Ngo by the Crown and an improper comment made by Crown counsel in the presence
    of the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Mohamed adopts the grounds of appeal advanced on
    behalf of Mr. Ngo and advances three additional grounds.  He contends first that the jury’s finding of
    guilt on the possession of firearms charges was unreasonable.  Second, he argues that the trial judge’s
    instructions on the drawing of inferences of knowledge from the circumstantial
    evidence concerning Mr. Mohamed’s conduct was deficient and, finally, he argues
    that the trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Mohamed’s s. 9 <i>Charter</i> rights were not violated and
    that the firearms seized from the automobile should have been excluded under s.
    24(2).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We called on the Crown to respond only to the
    submission in respect of inconsistent verdicts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h3>MR. NGO’S GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h3>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>I</span></h2>
  <h3>THE INCONSISTENT VERDICTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is fair to say that the Crown and the defence
    proceeded on the basis that the jury would not, for the purposes of determining
    the question of possession, distinguish between the possession of the three
    firearms and the two magazines in the bundle.  The trial judge, however, instructed the jury to address each count separately
    and instructed the jury on each count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We think it was open to the jury to infer that the
    appellants were in possession of the firearms, but still have a reasonable
    doubt on whether the Crown had proved that the appellants knew that the
    magazines were a distinct physical entity as opposed to simply part of the
    firearms.  This view, while perhaps
    generous to the accused, was, in our view, available on the evidence and the
    instructions given.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants have not met the “difficult onus” of
    showing that the different verdicts cannot possibly be reconciled on any
    rational view of the evidence and the applicable law: see <i>R. v. Pittimann</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 381 at para. 7.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;
'>II</span></h2>
  <h3>THE RESPONSE TO THE JURY QUESTION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the jury asked an ambiguous
    question and the trial judge was obliged to seek clarification from the jury
    before responding to that question.  We
    reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge discussed the question posed by the
    jury with counsel before answering it.  The
    answer was given with the support of counsel.  After answering the question, the trial judge offered to go over the
    definition of the word “possession”.  She
    had used that word in answering the jury’s question.  The foreperson asked her to do so and the
    trial judge repeated the definition of “possession” she had given in her
    charge.  That definition was correct in law.  The trial judge also told the jury that it
    could return with any further questions it might have after the supper break.  In our view, the trial judge’s handling of
    the question was flawless.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case is clearly distinguishable from <i>R. v. Layton</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 540 where
    the trial judge concluded his answer to the jury’s question by telling the jury
    that he could not assist them any further.  That is not what happened in this case.  </p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;
'>III</span></h2>
  <h3>THE <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> INSTRUCTION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave the jury an unassailable <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i> instruction.  The appellants submit,
    however, that later in her charge, the trial judge undermined this instruction
    by telling the jury that it was obliged to choose between the conflicting
    evidence of Constable Levesque and another police officer as to the location of
    the automobile in which the firearms were discovered.  The appellants submit that the trial judge
    erred in telling the jury that it must decide which of the two Crown witnesses “was
    right”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We think this portion of the instruction was intended
    to assist the jury in the assessment of Officer Levesque’s credibility and
    reliability by focusing on the competing evidence as to the location of the car
    and, therefore, Officer Levesque’s ability to see the occupants of the car as
    he testified.  Officer Levesque was an
    important Crown witness.  The trial judge
    explained to the jury that the location of the car was significant in assessing
    Officer Levesque’s credibility and that if the jury could not be satisfied that
    the car was where Officer Levesque said it was, the jury would want to
    “seriously examine” whether it could rely on his evidence regarding the
    observations of where the various appellants were in the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that the impugned comments were not
    directed at the burden of proof and did not undermine the faultless <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction given earlier by the
    trial judge.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;
'>IV</span></h2>
  <h3>THE MISTRIAL APPLICATION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated above, there was a conflict in the Crown
    evidence concerning the location where the car in which the appellants were
    seen was parked.  In the course of
    cross-examining Mr. Ngo, the Crown asked him if his evidence as to the location
    of the car had been influenced by the evidence he had heard one of the police
    officers give earlier in the trial.  The
    defence immediately objected.  The trial
    judge allowed the question but as we read the record, it was not pursued by the
    Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant argues that the question put
    to Mr. Ngo was improper because it put Mr. Ngo in the position of having his
    obligatory presence when the Crown evidence was tendered, used to undermine the
    credibility of his subsequent testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concern underlying this submission is a legitimate
    one.  It would be unfair and improper to suggest
    that an accused should not be believed because he had had the opportunity to
    hear the witnesses who testified for the Crown.  In our view, however, the single question asked here does not carry with
    it that improper implication.  It may
    well be that the Crown was simply exploring the extent to which Mr. Ngo had any
    independent recollection of where the car was located as opposed to relying on
    what he had heard a police officer say.  That is legitimate cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever the intended purpose, the Crown did not
    proceed beyond a single question which was never answered.  That question, standing alone, does not
    constitute improper cross-examination, much less improper cross-examination
    that would merit a mistrial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the impugned question was asked,
    Crown counsel made an observation in the presence of the <span class=GramE>jury,
    that</span> clearly signalled to the jury that the Crown had been surprised by
    and did not accept the evidence of one of the Crown witnesses concerning the
    location of the car.  This was a comment
    by the Crown of his personal opinion of the veracity or reliability of certain
    evidence.  That kind of comment is
    improper.  The objection was
    appropriate.  The trial judge admonished
    Crown counsel.  Crown counsel apologized
    and no further reference was made to the matter.  It is unfortunate that Crown counsel made the
    comment.  However, we see no error in the
    trial judge’s refusal to grant a mistrial based on this single, isolated and
    relatively minor misstep by Crown counsel.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Mohamed argues that the verdict was unreasonable because there was insufficient
    evidence on which a jury could infer the control requirement of a possession
    charge given that at the highest he drove Mr. Ngo’s mother’s car for a short
    time.  We do not agree.  The jury was entitled to infer control if
    they accepted that version of events.  </span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span
lang=EN-US> Knowledge from Circumstantial Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  When the police
    initially spoke to the appellants, the appellants were with two men named Hau
    and Omar.  While the police were
    questioning Mr. Hau, Mr. Mohamed complained loudly to the police that they had
    stopped the men because of their race.  The
    trial judge told the jury that one inference to be drawn from Mr. Mohamed’s
    outburst was that he was trying to distract the police from focusing on Mr. Hau
    because he knew Mr. Hau had a gun in his possession and that there were additional
    firearms in the motor vehicle.  The appellant
    argues that this latter inference was speculative and not reasonably available from
    Mr. Mohamed’s outburst, but rather amounts to improper speculation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the way the trial judge addressed
    this matter.  She introduced the concept
    of circumstantial evidence by telling the jury that speculation played no role
    in the judicial process.  With respect to
    Mr. Mohamed’s outburst, she explicitly cautioned the jury not to make a leap to
    guilt from evidence that could reasonably speak to innocence.  In our view, the jury would clearly
    understand from this instruction that Mr. Mohamed’s outburst had no evidentiary
    significance on its own and could not, on its own, be used to infer guilt, but
    that it was tendered as part of the entire evidentiary picture which the jury would
    consider in deciding whether Mr. Mohamed knew there were firearms in the
    car.  The instruction as to the potential
    evidentiary use of Mr. Mohamed’s comments was proper in the circumstances.  We do not accept the submission that the
    evidence had no probative value and the jury should have been so
    instructed.  </p>

    weapons (the magazine).  Even if the
    looking into the window with a flashlight could be construed as a search, it
    also had no connection to the earlier arrest and detention of the
    appellant.  </span></p>

    the search of the car that resulted in the seizure of the guns and magazines was
    conducted under the authorization of a search warrant.  There is no suggestion that any of the
    grounds relied on to obtain the warrant were based on anything said or done by
    Mr. Mohamed after he was detained and taken to the police station.  Put simply, Mr. Mohamed’s arrest and
    detention had nothing to do with the discovery of the car, the search of the
    car, or the seizure of the guns.  This
    ground of appeal cannot succeed.</span></p>

    addition to the convictions for the firearm offences returned by the jury, Mr.
    Mohamed pled guilty to violating three separate prohibition orders.  The trial judge had all of these matters
    before her at the time of sentencing.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge set out the principles that govern sentencing.  She considered in detail the issue of parity
    as between the two appellants. She recognized Mr. Mohamed’s tragic and troubled
    background and gave careful reasons for her conclusion that disparate sentences
    were warranted for the two appellants.  These reasons focused on Mr. Mohamed’s persistent criminality and the
    fact that Mr. Ngo was a youthful first offender.  Mr. Mohamed’s persistent criminality included
    convictions for firearm offences that had resulted in a sentence of five years
    and seven months.  Mr. Mohamed committed
    the current very serious firearm offences within about a month of his release following
    the significant sentences for the earlier firearm charges.</span></p>

    also note that in imposing an effective sentence of nine years, the trial judge
    imposed a sentence that was only marginally higher than trial counsel for Mr.
    Mohamed had suggested was appropriate.  Counsel had argued for a seven or eight year sentence.  </span></p>
