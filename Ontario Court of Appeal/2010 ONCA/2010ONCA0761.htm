  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant wife appeals from the judgment of Corkery J. concerning
    the Kerr&nbsp;Street property and the failure to order child support for the
    period from July 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003.  By cross-appeal, the
    husband seeks leave to appeal the costs order made by the trial judge.  For the
    following reasons the wife’s appeal is dismissed and the husband’s cross-appeal
    is also dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Kerr Street Property</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that the respondent had a fifty percent beneficial
    interest by way of resulting trust in the Kerr Street property.  The appellant
    attacks the finding of a resulting trust on two bases:  first, that the issue
    of resulting trust was never pleaded; second, that the trial judge failed to
    consider the respondent’s motive for putting the company that held title to the
    property into the appellant’s name.  Finally, the appellant submits that even
    if there was a resulting trust, the trial judge erred in finding that the
    respondent had a fifty percent beneficial interest.  We would not give effect
    to any of these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the resulting trust was never pleaded.  However, it is
    apparent from the transcript of the trial that the parties were well aware that
    the respondent’s interest in the Kerr Street property was a live issue. 
    Counsel for the appellant at trial specifically referred to the issue in his
    questioning of the respondent.  Further, the record is filled with questions
    about the respondent’s contribution to the purchase of the property and his
    subsequent work on the property.  These questions would only be relevant to the
    issue of either resulting or constructive trust, or possibly <i>quantum meruit.</i> 
    There was no objection to any of this evidence.  Additionally, there is nothing
    in the record to suggest that the appellant claimed that she was prejudiced by
    the deficiency in the pleadings.  The trial judge noted in his reasons that the
    appellant was not disadvantaged by the fact that the respondent raised this
    issue at trial.  While the trial judge dealt differently with the appellant’s
    claim for a reverse constructive trust, he provided reasons for the different
    treatment.  In particular, he found it would be “manifestly unfair” to consider
    that issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that the appellant was not prejudiced by the
    respondent’s failure to amend the pleadings.  In the circumstances it was open
    to the trial judge to consider the respondent’s claim for a beneficial interest
    in the property.  As this court said in <i>Cassidy v. McNeil</i>, <span
style='color:black'>(2010), 99 O.R. (3d) 81</span><span style='font-family:
&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black'> </span>at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, the husband apparently did not advance any
    argument of prejudice at trial, an argument that could have been accommodated
    by an adjournment, if one was necessary. The decision not to raise the argument
    at trial supports the conclusion that the husband suffered no prejudice. In any
    event, there is no evidence that the husband suffered either surprise or
    prejudice from any technical deficiency in the wife's Answer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would also not give effect to the submission concerning the
    respondent’s motive for putting the property in the name of a corporation
    wholly owned by the appellant.  The respondent’s evidence was that on the
    advice of an accountant he and the appellant agreed that the Kerr Street
    property should be held in the corporation.  While the respondent had some
    concerns about tax liability, there was nothing to show that there was any
    claim by Revenue Canada or any other real creditors at the time of the purchase
    or later.  The evidence demonstrated that the parties hoped that the increase
    in value  of the property would someday be available for the children.  There
    was a legitimate reason in the minds of the parties for favouring a corporate
    structure for holding title to the property.  In our view, this case falls
    within this court’s decision in <i>Launchbury v. Launchbury</i> (2005), 12
    R.F.L. (6th) 393 (C.A.), where the court said the following at para. 3:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We note there was no suggestion that any creditor
    or potential creditor was prejudiced by the property being registered in the
    appellant’s name. There was also evidence that the decision to put the property
    in the appellant’s name was for a legitimate purpose, namely, because of the
    dangerous work that the respondent had done as a police officer in the
    anti-gang squad.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding
    that the respondent had a fifty percent beneficial interest in the Kerr Street
    property.  This argument is based on the theory that the respondent’s only
    contribution to the purchase of the property was the $90,000 inheritance that
    was used to pay down the mortgage on the matrimonial home so that a second
    mortgage could be taken out to finance the purchase of the Kerr Street
    property.  However, there was a great deal more evidence in the record
    concerning the respondent’s contribution to the payment of the mortgages as
    well as evidence concerning the maintenance and repair work performed by the
    respondent.  There was a foundation in the evidence for the trial judge’s
    conclusion and we have not been persuaded that he made any palpable or
    overriding error in his appreciation of the evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Child Support</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to order the
    respondent to pay child support for the period from July 1, 2002 (the date of
    separation) until December&nbsp;31, 2003 (the effective date of the order of
    Herold J. dated March 2, 2005).  The appellant points out that in his reasons,
    Herold J. left this issue open on the basis that the trial judge would “be in a
    better position to fix a more accurate date for the notional commencement of
    child support”.  The trial judge did not deal with this issue except to say
    that he had “considered and chosen not to revisit the temporary child support
    order of Herold J.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it would have been preferable had the trial judge provided reasons
    for that decision, the basis for the decision is apparent from the record.  The
    appellant and the respondent operated appliance stores.  The stores were held
    in the name of a corporation wholly owned by the appellant.  The appellant kept
    the company books while the respondent ran the stores.  After the separation,
    on September 10, 2002, the appellant locked the respondent out of the stores
    and summoned the police.  The respondent no longer had any source of income.  Despite
    the fact that orders were made to assist the respondent in resuming operation
    of the Etobicoke store, the respondent claimed he was unable to do so because
    of intimidation from the appellant’s boyfriend.  Admittedly, the respondent
    could have taken steps to enforce the orders of Kruzick J. and his evidence for
    failing to do so is far from compelling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the appellant brought two applications, prior to the 2005
    application heard by Herold J., to obtain child support.  These applications
    were heard on January 30, 2003 (Kruzick J.) and March 31, 2003 (Herold J.).  In
    both cases, the application judges refused to order child support because the
    respondent had no income.  In the meantime, the evidence shows that the
    appellant had more than sufficient income to care for the children and her own
    needs.  In fact, the evidence shows that her income increased following the
    separation.  Thus, there were circumstances from which the trial judge could
    conclude that he should not interfere with the original order made by Herold J.
    in 2005.  As the Supreme Court of Canada said in <i>D.B.S. v. S.R.G.</i>,
    [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231 at para.&nbsp;95:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It will not always be appropriate for a retroactive
    award to be ordered. Retroactive awards will not always resonate with the
    purposes behind the child support regime; this will be so where the child would
    get no discernible benefit from the award. Retroactive awards may also cause
    hardship to a payor parent in ways that a prospective award would not. In
    short, while a free-standing obligation to support one's children must be
    recognized, it will not always be appropriate for a court to enforce this
    obligation once the relevant time period has passed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CROSS-APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial of this matter was heard in October and December of 2008.  The
    trial judge provided lengthy reasons in September 2009.  His task in dealing
    with this case was a daunting one.  The parties had failed to make proper
    disclosure and the evidence at the trial was deficient in many respects.  At
    the conclusion of his reasons, the trial judge said the following concerning
    costs:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Rule 24 of the Family Law Rules creates a
    presumption that a successful party is entitled to the costs of the case. I
    have considered the factors identified in subsection 24(11).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, success has been mixed. Deficiencies
    in disclosure and, ultimately, deficiencies in the evidence in this case made
    the trial and adjudication of this matter needlessly complex and tedious. Both
    parties bear responsibility for this. The remedy for deficient disclosure,
    where such disclosure is necessary to a party’s case, is a motion for
    production. It is never appropriate to proceed to trial, to pursue such a
    claim, and expect the court to reason around the deficiencies. Such practice
    must be discouraged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No costs shall be awarded in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his cross-appeal, the respondent submits that the trial judge erred
    in principle by failing to inquire as to whether there had been offers to
    settle that would have influenced the costs decision.  Counsel has produced the
    offers to settle from the parties.  The respondent made several offers to
    settle including an offer in June 2003 and September 2008. The appellant made
    only one offer to settle in the course of the trial.  The respondent’s recovery
    at trial arguably exceeds the 2003 offer to settle.  Therefore, counsel submits
    that the respondent should at least be given costs on a partial indemnity
    basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No doubt it would have been preferable that the trial judge inquired
    about offers to settle.  However, we have now had the opportunity to review
    those offers and, in our view, they would not have affected the result.  The
    husband’s 2008 offer does not comply with Rule 18.  The 2003 offer was made
    before there had been financial disclosure and at a time when it would have
    been impossible for the appellant to determine whether the offer should be
    accepted.  Thereafter, as observed by the trial judge, there were continuing
    problems with disclosure of financial information.  We have not been persuaded
    that there is a basis for interfering with the order made by the trial judge.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed.  The appeal was
    by far the most significant aspect of the case and the respondent is therefore
    entitled to some costs, notwithstanding dismissal of his cross-appeal. 
    Accordingly, the appellant shall pay costs to the respondent fixed in the
    amount of $10,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
