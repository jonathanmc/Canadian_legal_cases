  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial by judge alone the appellant was convicted on thirteen
    of seventeen charges, one of which was stayed pursuant to the <i>Kienapple</i> principle.  Counts 1 through 8 related to various assaults on K.M., the
    complainant.  Counts 9 through 13 related to the possession of two handguns and
    ammunition.  Count 14 related to a breach of recognizance for possessing a
    weapon and counts 15 through 17 related to possession of cocaine for the
    purpose of trafficking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Sentence Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to sentence, the appellant submits that subsequent to his
    sentence in relation to the thirteen charges of which he was convicted he was
    sentenced to a further period of incarceration for an unrelated offence. The
    sentence he received for that unrelated matter when added to the sentence
    received for the matters before this court amount to a penitentiary sentence. 
    Accordingly, because the total sentence exceeds a reformatory sentence, the
    probationary part of the sentence before us has become unlawful.  The Crown
    concedes that the probation imposed by the trial judge, in light of the ensuing
    events, cannot stand.  That part of the sentence will accordingly be set aside.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  First, he argues that the
    trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the complainant’s prior
    inconsistent videotaped statement.  Second, he argues ineffective assistance of
    counsel.  This latter ground of appeal relates to an Agreed Statement of Facts
    which was entered into evidence following the appellant’s testimony at trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant’s grandmother contacted the police on April 4, 2003. 
    She was concerned for her granddaughter’s safety.  The grandmother advised the
    police that a threat by the appellant included a threat with a weapon.  Given
    the allegation of a weapon, police took the threat seriously and police were
    placed to observe the grandmother’s residence and to intervene if necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 3:00 p.m. on April 4, 2003, Detective MacDonald and his partner
    attended at the grandmother’s home.  They asked initial questions of the
    complainant.  Based on their observations both officers concluded she had been
    assaulted.  The police requested a videotaped statement from both K.M. and her
    grandmother. They were both willing to provide a statement and accompanied the
    police to the station.  In her videotaped statement, K.M. described six
    different assaults that the appellant allegedly committed on her, since 2002. 
    The final incident involved the appellant putting a gun on her and forcing her
    to strip naked, take a shower, and serve him drinks for an hour.  After the
    incident was over, the complainant said she wrapped the gun in her pyjama
    bottoms and hid the gun in a shoe box amongst her clothes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 4, 2003, shortly before midnight, the appellant was arrested in
    a high-risk take-down.  A digital scale was found in his jacket pocket and 9.97
    grams of cocaine in a series of four baggies, was located on the passenger seat
    floor by the door.  The police obtained a search warrant to search the
    residence of the appellant’s parents for a weapon as described by the
    complainant in her videotaped statement. The search warrant was executed
    shortly after midnight on April 5, 2003.  In the appellant’s bedroom the police
    located two handguns, ammunition and potential drug related items, including an
    electronic scale, a grinder, various cutting agents and baggies.  They also
    seized what appeared to be two debt lists dated 2001 and 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial the complainant recanted the allegations outlined in the
    videotaped statement.  She claimed that when she gave the statement she was
    angry at the appellant for his infidelity, high on ecstasy and had had little
    sleep in days. She had continued her relationship with the appellant and had,
    one month before his conviction, given birth to his child.  After a <i>voir
    dire</i>, the trial judge admitted the statement into evidence for the truth of
    its contents.  The complainant was also declared adverse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified and during his examination-in-chief alleged a
    complex police initiated conspiracy in defence of the possession charge. 
    Immediately thereafter, the Crown notified the court of its intention to
    investigate the appellant’s allegation and call reply evidence. Defence counsel
    did not re-examine the appellant after cross-examination.  Rather than calling
    reply evidence defence counsel and the Crown agreed to file an Agreed Statement
    of Facts (ASF) which touched on four narrow issues. The ASF clarified and
    corrected certain evidence which the appellant had given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge convicted the appellant on four of the eight assault
    charges, of pointing a firearm and five other gun-related charges and of breach
    of recognizance as the result of the gun convictions.  He was also convicted of
    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of the
    proceeds of crime.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The <i>KGB</i> Statement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    improperly admitted the complainant’s <i>KGB</i> statement.  His argument
    essentially is that the video recording does not meet the requirements
    established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. K.G.B</i>., [1993] 1
    S.C.R. 740.  The criticisms include that the camera was not close enough to the
    complainant, that there was no additional close-up photo within the frame
    showing the complainant at close range so that the trial judge could properly
    assess her demeanor, and that the faces of the interrogating officers were not
    shown.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, this argument is entirely without
    merit.  First and foremost, video recording has come a long way in the
    seventeen years since <i>KGB</i>.  The subject video, played during the
    argument of the appeal, is clear and focused.  The complainant’s face is
    clearly visible at all times.  While there was no second camera focused on the
    officers, their faces are clearly and adequately visible in profile.  No
    complaint is made of the quality of the audio recording.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is clear from her reasons that the trial
    judge had no difficulty with the quality of the recording.  Her reasons for
    judgment include the following observations in relation to the video recording:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[K.M.] recanted her videotaped
    statement.  Her evidence at trial recanting the videotaped statement appeared
    flat, stilted and scripted. She simply denied any abuse and provided no
    explanation for her previous statement that was credible.  There were moments
    during the trial, during her viva voce testimony where her evidence appeared to
    be true when she was not being asked directly about the allegations and she was
    “off script”. By way of contrast, her videotaped statement was credible,
    natural in its delivery and made sense.  It was understated.  She did not
    exaggerate.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the two officers
    conducted a professional, sensitive interview. They asked questions, but were
    not directive or leading in how they pursued the videotaped interview.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The videotape confirms that [K.M.]
    is angry and upset by Mr. Curnew’s conduct – not surprisingly. However, the
    thrust of her evidence was that the incident with the gun really, really
    frightened her.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There is no indication in the
    videotape of any exaggeration of events, there is no indication of any jealousy
    in her evidence.  If anything, she understates what happened. She is angry
    about him arranging for her to go into debt. However, she realizes that by
    coming forward to the police, she will probably not see the money again.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Defence also raises the issue of
    the allegation that she had taken a narcotic, ecstasy, before providing the
    statement.  I have previously ruled upon this issue. I concluded that she had
    not taken a narcotic or, if she had, it did not affect the quality and
    reliability of her evidence. I repeat that conclusion here.  I reject the
    suggestion that [K.M.] had taken anything that affected the reliability or
    truthfulness of her disclosure made to the police in her videotaped statement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is apparent from these comments as well as
    her ruling on the admissibility of the statement, that the trial judge had no
    difficulty with the quality of the video recording or with her ability to
    observe the complainant’s demeanor.  In my view, the appellant’s interpretation
    of <i>KGB</i> is too narrow.  That case does not require that, to be
    admissible, the video recording must be in the exact same format as the video
    recording was in that case.  As Lamer C.J. explained at p. 793-94: “a complete
    videotape record of the type described above, <i>or one which duplicates the
    experience of observing a witness in the courtroom to the same extent</i>, is
    another important indicium of reliability” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The quality of the video recording was not
    raised as an issue at trial.  The only issue raised at trial was voluntariness,
    where the defence argued that the complainant had had little sleep in the hours
    preceding the making of her video statement and was high on ecstasy at the
    time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In response to that argument, after reviewing
    the law relating to operating mind, the trial judge was satisfied that even if
    she accepted the complainant’s trial evidence in relation to the taking of the
    drug, any effects from her ingestion would have worn off in any event by the
    time she gave her statement and the quality and reliability of her evidence was
    not affected. It will be noted, however, that the trial judge did not accept
    the complainant’s evidence that she had taken drugs. Because it was not raised
    at trial, the quality of the video recording is not the subject of the trial
    judge’s ruling on the admissibility of the statement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, in dealing with the voluntariness issue
    that was raised, there are findings made by the trial judge from which it may
    reasonably be inferred that she had no difficulty with the quality of the video
    recording.  By way of example:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The most telling evidence, in my
    view, of an operating mind is the contents of the videotape, itself.  The
    answers given by [K.M.] to the questions asked were spontaneous and natural. 
    She included gestures by way of explanation.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The flow of her evidence was
    natural.  She also exhibited a good memory for detail.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Throughout her statement she was
    co-operative, quiet spoken and provided her evidence in a clear, comprehensive
    manner.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I note that [K.M.] had no physical
    signs of any sort of impairment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In conclusion, it is obvious from her ruling on
    the <i>voir dire</i> as well as her reasons for judgment that the trial judge
    had no difficulty with the quality of the video recording and she was able to
    observe the complainant’s demeanor in a meaningful way.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This ground of appeal concerns trial counsel’s
    agreement to file the Agreed Statement of Facts.  The effect of that document
    was to undermine some of the evidence which the appellant had given at trial. 
    He argues that the filing of that statement made him out to be a liar in the
    trial judge’s eyes. He argues that had his credibility not been impugned in
    this way, he might have been believed and the result would have been different.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant gave evidence at trial.  In the
    course of giving that evidence he alleged a complex police initiated conspiracy
    in defence of the possession charge which included the alleged recycling of
    exhibits by the police from an earlier trial at which the appellant had been
    acquitted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There can be no question that the appellant was
    a difficult client who had his own ideas about how the trial should be run.  In
    giving his evidence, the appellant’s answers implicated his trial counsel in
    the sense that he indicated that his allegations could be confirmed by his
    lawyer.  Defence counsel was put in a difficult position in attempting to
    balance his duty to represent his client to the best of his ability and his
    duty as an officer of the court to ensure that the court is not misled.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Defence counsel did not re-examine his client
    after cross-examination was complete.  In my view, he cannot be criticized for
    his decision.  Just to take one example, the appellant alleged that the debt
    sheet, which had been made an exhibit at trial and supported the charge of
    possession for the purpose, was the same document that had been made an exhibit
    at a trial before Matlow J. in 2003 where the appellant was acquitted for a
    similar charge.  His evidence was that the police merely recycled that exhibit
    to support the charges against him in 2005.  Trial counsel in 2003 and 2005 was
    the same lawyer.  In his evidence the appellant indicated that trial counsel
    could prove his allegation.  Trial counsel had compared the exhibits filed in
    2003 and 2005 and knew they were not the same.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown indicated it would call reply evidence
    which would demonstrate the falsity of this allegation.  Trial counsel
    determined that the filing of the Agreed Statement of Fact would be better than
    a string of witnesses who would prove the falsity of the appellant’s evidence
    with devastating effect.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the Agreed Statement
    was filed without his consent and that trial counsel did not inform him nor
    give him the opportunity to participate in it.  This was a tactical decision
    and one properly available to him as an officer of the court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 34: “Where, in the course of a trial, counsel makes a
    decision in good faith and in the best interest of his client, a court should
    not look behind it save only to prevent a miscarriage of justice.”</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[27]     Incompetence is
    determined by a reasonableness standard.  The analysis proceeds upon a strong
    presumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable
    professional assistance. The onus is on the appellant to establish the acts or
    omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable
    professional judgment.  The wisdom of hindsight has no place in this analysis.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[28]  Miscarriages of justice may
    take many forms in this context.  In some instances, counsel’s performance may
    have resulted in procedural unfairness. In others, the reliability of the trial’s
    result may have been compromised.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[29]  In those cases where it is
    apparent that no prejudice has occurred, it will usually be undesirable for
    appellate courts to consider the performance component of the analysis. The
    object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel’s performance or
    professional conduct. The latter is left to the profession’s self-governing
    body.  If it is appropriate to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the
    ground of no prejudice having occurred, that is the course to follow (<i>Strickland</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 697).</span></p>

    Her reasons for judgment make it clear that she rejected the appellant’s evidence
    for many reasons and not just on the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts.</span></p>

    the appellant as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>He was an arrogant, nonresponsive
    witness.  He blamed the system for the false accusations and the conspiracy
    against him.  He was always the victim.  He was volatile and angry in giving
    his answers, although he tried very hard to contain his reactions.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>His story and version of events
    often bordered on the fantastical.  It appeared that he just made things up as
    he went along.  If there ever was a plan, with his counsel being aware of the
    theory of the defence, it appears that Mr. Curnew did not follow the plan.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Andrew Curnew aggressively
    asserted facts and events which were proved conclusively beyond a reasonable
    doubt in reply evidence not to bear any resemblance to the truth.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>When giving answers, Andrew Curnew
    was cagey.  He tried to figure out what the question was and what its relevance
    was before providing an answer.  He had his own agenda.  I do not accept his
    evidence. His manner and attitude in testifying speak volumes, however, with
    respect to the nature of the relationship and the dynamic of control exerted by
    Andrew Curnew in his relationship with [K.M.]</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Andrew Curnew was always right,
    and others are always to blame. This quality was obvious from his testimony
    before the court as he spun an incredible web to try to explain away
    significantly incriminating evidence.  According to him, he was the victim of
    an elaborate police conspiracy.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Andrew Curnew acknowledged that he
    broke [Ms M.’s] nose. He was faced with the awkward observation of two police
    officers who confirmed that on April 4th, 2003, that each of them observed the
    cut on [Ms. M.’s] nose and swelling around her eye.  Andrew Curnew then
    fabricated some story that he accidentally broke [Ms. M.’s] nose when she hit a
    snowbank while driving a car.  At one point he says he was asleep and his arm
    accidentally flung out and hit her nose.  Later, he said it was a protective
    reaction towards her in the context of an accident.  I do not accept either
    explanation.  It is part of the elaborate web to cover the truth.  I note, as
    well, that [Ms. M.] simply denied that he broke her nose.  She did not outline
    any accident theory in her evidence.</span></p>
