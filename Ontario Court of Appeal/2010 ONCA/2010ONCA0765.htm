  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on this appeal is whether the motion judge
    exercised her discretion unreasonably when she dismissed the plaintiffs’ action
    because they were two days late in paying the costs component of an earlier
    court order.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>A.        FACTS</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Background<u></u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs owned four commercial properties in the
    Niagara region.  Each was mortgaged.  The mortgages went into default, and the
    mortgagee issued notices of sale.  Eventually the properties were sold.  The plaintiffs allege that the notices of sale were defective and that
    the sale itself was improvident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs delivered a statement of claim in June
    2007.  Numerous interlocutory proceedings
    then ensued.  The plaintiffs sought to
    maintain a certificate of pending litigation that they had registered against
    the properties, and to obtain interim possession.  They were unsuccessful, though two motion
    judges who heard the interim possession motion each concluded that the
    plaintiffs had raised a serious issue to be tried. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2009 the defendants moved to dismiss the
    action for delay on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to note pleadings
    closed.  The motion was returnable
    December 3, 2009.  The plaintiffs asked
    for and were granted an adjournment of the defendants’ motion to February 16,
    2010.  They were required to file their
    responding material by January 5, 2010.  By February 16, however, they had filed no responding material.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(b)     The February 16, 2010 Order<u></u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion on February 16, 2010 was heard by <span
class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.  At the outset,
    he granted an order removing the plaintiffs’ lawyer as solicitor of
    record.  The plaintiffs then asked for a
    further adjournment to retain new counsel and deliver responding material.  <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J. granted
    the adjournment, but on terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He adjourned the defendants’ motion to April 26, 2010,
    and imposed on the plaintiffs filing deadlines and a costs sanction.  The costs sanction has led to this
    appeal.  <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Application
    adjourned to April 26, 2010 at 10 am, on the following terms:</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>1.</i><i>  The adjourned date and time is peremptory
    to the Plaintiffs, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Duffin</span> and Hectares Properties
    Inc.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>2.</i><i>  Ms <span class=SpellE>Duffin</span> and Hectares shall serve on the other defendants appearing today and file with
    this court notice of retainer of new counsel by Tuesday, February 23, 2010.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>3.</i><i>  Any responding material for
    this motion and any other motions to be heard on the return date shall be filed
    by Thursday February 25, 2010, failing which no responding material may be
    filed or will be considered by this court.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>4.</i><i>  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Duffin</span> and Hectares Properties Inc. shall pay costs thrown away to date for each of
    the four counsel appearing today for the four represented defendants, such
    costs fixed at $2,000.00 per counsel.  Such costs are payable by Monday, March 22, 2010.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>If any of the conditions above 1, 2 and 4<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></b></span></span></a> is not met by the indicated deadline, the main action by all three plaintiffs
    (Mr. <span class=SpellE>Duffin</span> not being represented or appearing today)
    shall be dismissed without further order of this court, with costs payable on a
    partial indemnity basis, to be fixed by me based on written submissions to be
    served and filed on a schedule to be determined by me if required.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs satisfied the second condition.  They filed a notice of change of solicitors
    by February 23, 2010.  They also
    satisfied the third condition.  They
    delivered responding material by February 25, 2010.  And the plaintiffs satisfied the fourth
    condition, albeit two days late.  They
    paid $2,000 to each of the four sets of defendants ($8,000 in total) on March
    24, 2010, over a month before the return date of the motion, but two days after
    the date stipulated in <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants accepted payment of the costs and then
    wrote to <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J. asking that the plaintiffs’ action
    be dismissed for failure to comply with his order.  He did not respond to the letter.  Before the return date of the motion, the
    defendants took no other formal step to obtain a dismissal of the action.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The April 26, 2010 order of the motion
    judge<u></u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>At the
    beginning of the motion on April 26, 2010, the defendants asked for an order
    that the action be dismissed because the plaintiffs had not complied with the
    fourth condition of <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order – in other
    words, they had not paid $8,000 in costs on time.  </span>The motion judge granted the order.  She gave these brief reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[4] The Plaintiffs agree that the costs ordered by
    Justice <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> to have been paid by March 22, 2010
    were in fact not paid until March 24, 2010.  There was no explanation provided as to why the costs were not paid in time.  The Plaintiffs ask me however to extend the
    time for payment of costs such that the action may proceed.  They submit that the costs were just two days
    late and that there has been no prejudice to the Defendants as a result of the
    delay in payment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[5] The Plaintiffs did not appeal Justice <span
class=SpellE>Lococo’s</span> Order nor did they bring a Motion requesting that
    the Order be set aside, varied or amended.  Justice <span class=SpellE>Lococo’s</span> Order is clear that
    non-compliance with the condition regarding payment of costs would result in
    the main action being dismissed.  There
    has been non-compliance.  The fact that
    the costs were paid late is sufficient for a finding of non-compliance,
    regardless of how late the payment was.  Furthermore, the existence or non-existence of any prejudice of the
    Defendants does not change the finding of non-compliance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[6] Justice <span class=SpellE>Lococo’s</span> Order speaks for itself.  I am not
    prepared to vary that Order.  As such,
    the main action by all three Plaintiffs is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is from the motion judge’s order that the plaintiffs
    now appeal.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>B.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge’s order dismissing the action is a discretionary order, and thus
    is entitled to deference from an appellate court.  However, where that discretion is exercised
    unreasonably, an appellate court may intervene.  That is the case here.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge undoubtedly had the authority to vary <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order to extend the time for compliance with the costs condition of that
    order.  Rule 3.02(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> gave her that
    authority.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  In deciding whether to vary <span
class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order, the motion judge ought to have put the plaintiffs’
    non-compliance in context, and considered the justice of the case.  Respectfully, in my view, she did not do so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    considering the justice of the case, it is fair, as the defendants point out,
    to take into account that the plaintiffs breached a peremptory court
    order.  But weighed against that breach are
    several other considerations, each of which <span class=SpellE>favours</span> granting the plaintiffs relief.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    a court should always be reluctant to dismiss a claim on grounds unrelated to
    its merits.  To do so is contrary to the
    general principle – found in rule 1.04(1) – that animates all of our <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>: “These rules
    shall be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least
    expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    on these kinds of motions, a court must consider the key issue of the prejudice
    to the parties that will result from its order.  Here, the defendants suffer no prejudice whatsoever if <span
class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order is varied to relieve against the
    plaintiffs’ non-compliance.  On the other
    hand, the plaintiffs will suffer great prejudice if the order is not varied:  their action will be dismissed without a
    hearing on the merits.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    the court should consider the underlying purpose of the order that was
    breached.  <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order was essentially a scheduling order, intended to ensure that there
    would be no further adjournments and to compensate the defendants for their
    costs thrown away because of the previous adjournments.  All of the conditions of <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order were met over a month before the return date of the motion.  Therefore, the motion could have proceeded
    without further delay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    the court should consider the seriousness of the breach.  Here, the breach was minor – a payment of
    costs made two days late but, as I have said, made a month before the motion
    was to be argued.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Taking
    all of these considerations into account, the justice of the case warrants
    relieving the plaintiffs from their untimely compliance with the costs
    condition of <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order.</span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>C.       CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would set aside the order of the motion judge.  In its place I would extend the time for compliance with the fourth
    condition of <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J.’s order from March 22 to March
    24, 2010, and I would dismiss the defendants’ motions.  The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of
    the appeal in the agreed upon amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and
    applicable taxes.</span></p>
