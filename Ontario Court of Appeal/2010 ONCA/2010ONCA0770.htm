style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no merit in the appeal from conviction.  The trial judge’s
    instructions on the approach the jury should take in assessing credibility
    disclosed no error.  They were in accordance with the principles enunciated by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. W. (R.)</i> (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d.)
    134.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to sentence, while we agree that the total sentence of
    fourteen and a half years, less 4 years for time spent in pre-trial custody,
    was severe, we are not persuaded that it was manifestly excessive.  The
    appellant subjected his entire family to degrading and controlling behaviour on
    a constant and persistent basis for many years.  In the course of this conduct,
    he sexually assaulted his two daughters and in doing so, he committed a gross
    breach of trust.  In the case of one daughter, who was cognitively impaired,
    the abuse occurred on almost a daily basis between the ages of 5 and 13 and
    included vaginal and anal intercourse, as well as the use of instruments such
    as candlesticks and beer bottles.  Both daughters have suffered greatly from
    the abuse and each has experienced severe psychological and emotional trauma. 
    In addition, the evidence establishes that the appellant is a pedophile who
    refuses to recognize his illness.  As such, he constitutes, at least
    potentially, a continuing risk to other young children.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On top of these aggravating factors, the appellant attempted to obstruct
    justice by threatening his wife to change her evidence and by breaching on two
    occasions his undertaking not to communicate with her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all of the circumstances, as indicated, a total sentence of 14 1/2
    years was not, in our view, manifestly excessive.  As the trial judge quite
    properly observed, there were no mitigating factors that might otherwise have
    alleviated the severity of the punishment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is
    dismissed, save as regards the sentence imposed on count 9 of the Indictment. 
    On that count, the trial judge imposed a concurrent sentence of 9 years.  That
    was an illegal sentence for the offence of assault and we would accordingly
    vary it to one year concurrent.  In all other respects, the sentence imposed
    shall remain the same.</p>
