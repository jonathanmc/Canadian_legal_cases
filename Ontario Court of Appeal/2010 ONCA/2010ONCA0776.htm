  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for the offence of
    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  He says a series of errors on the part of the
    trial judge have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  With his usual candour, Mr. Lockyer concedes that
    none of the errors of which complaint is made, standing alone, would be
    sufficient to permit this court to allow the appeal but, when taken together,
    the cumulative result is a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first issue relates to the evidence of the witness,
    Ms. Atiban.  The witness was originally
    charged along with the appellant and his co-accused.  She was the ex-girlfriend of the
    appellant.  In exchange for giving evidence
    against the appellant, her charges were stayed. Her animus toward the appellant
    was evident throughout her evidence.  Difficulties with her evidence were anticipated from the outset.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First when Ms. Atiban was asked whether the appellant
    was employed she responded to the effect that he earned his living by gambling,
    both legal and illegal, borrowing money from friends and pawning
    jewellery.  The trial judge permitted the
    Crown to lead evidence about the legal activities in which the appellant
    engaged that earned him income including gambling in the casino, borrowing
    money from friends and pawning jewellery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that these activities and in
    particular the gambling reflect badly on the appellant’s character and amount
    to what is in essence bad character evidence.  We do not accept this submission.  We do not agree this evidence can amount to bad character evidence.  The trial judge ruled that the witness could
    not, however, testify about any illegal gambling activities in which she claims
    the appellant was involved.  In our view,
    the ruling was correct and fair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next the appellant argues that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Atiban</span>,
    on several occasions mentioned that the appellant was in jail and once that
    he’d been on parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first occasion, the trial judge asked defence
    counsel if he wanted a mid-trial instruction to be given to the jury on that
    point and he declined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the subsequent occasions when jail was mentioned, no
    objection was made by defence counsel and again when asked, he declined the
    trial judge’s offer to give a mid-trial instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During cross-examination, the witness again mentioned
    jail when she was asked about a telephone conversation she’d had with the
    appellant.  Defence counsel tried to have
    Atiban agree with his suggestion that the appellant may have indicated a
    willingness to plead guilty out of devotion to her. When defence counsel pushed
    Ms. <span class=SpellE>Atiban</span> suggesting that in that telephone
    conversation the appellant had never confessed his guilt to her she responded
    that he was unlikely to do that when he was talking on a phone from the
    jail.  Once again, no objection by
    defence counsel and no request for a mid-trial instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the respondent states at para. 68 of its factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In short, not only did defence counsel oppose any
    instruction to the jury about the appellant’s detention, but he actively
    elicited additional evidence about the very subject.  This was a tactical decision aimed at
    neutralizing the very damning effect of the recorded conversation. This
    tactical decision should not be revisited on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole reference to the appellant being on parole was
    elicited by defence counsel when he asked Ms. Atiban why the appellant would
    use her cell phone instead of his own.  She responded that he did so because he had to provide his cell phones
    to a parole officer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again defence counsel did not request any mid-trial
    instruction.  The trial judge in her
    charge did, however, instruct the jury to disregard such evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Atiban, during cross-examination, also responded to
    a question about her own use of drugs by asking counsel if he wanted to discuss
    the appellant’s extensive use of drugs.  The appellant moved for a mis-trail which motion was dismissed by the
    trial judge.  She did <span class=GramE>however,</span> at that point direct the jury to disregard Ms. Atiban’s evidence about the
    appellant’s drug use.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel suggests that the language used by the trial
    judge in her mid-trial instruction on this point was unfortunate, prejudiced
    the defence and was incapable of remedy.  It ought to have provided a sufficient basis for a mis-trial.  We do not agree.  In our view, the instruction was appropriate
    at the time.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… At this point in the trial, the character of Mr.
    Erez is not in issue.  I am instructing
    you to disregard the evidence that Ms. Atiban just gave before the recess about
    Mr. Erez’s drug use.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant suggests that this language left the jury
    with the inference that he had a bad character but they were not going to hear
    about it NOW.  We do not agree. At that point
    in time, the trial judge had no way of knowing if at some future point in the
    trial the appellant’s character may be put in issue.  The instruction was appropriate in all the
    circumstances and she repeated it in her charge to the jury when she told them
    to disregard the evidence because Erez’s character was not in issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next complaint concerns the closing submissions of
    the co-accused Mr.&nbsp;Starchik who was not represented by counsel at trial.
    The appellant submits that Mr. Starchik, who did not testify, gave evidence in
    his submissions to the jury.  His
    “evidence” of which complaint is made may be grouped into three categories:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.         that he was a poor man, with no money
    and could not afford to pay the hotel bill or a lawyer;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.         he was “commanded” to do what he did and
    had to leave Montreal so quickly he did not have time to pack;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.         <span class=GramE>he</span> lied to the
    police, telling them Ms. Atiban was his girlfriend to protect someone else in
    the hotel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of this evidence it is argued, would have
    the jury conclude:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.         that Starchik would not have had the
    financial ability to acquire the drugs in question therefore the drugs had to
    belong to the appellant;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.         <span class=GramE>that</span> the
    appellant “commanded” him and was the ringleader.  Starchik was just following orders;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.         <span class=GramE>he</span> lied to
    police to protect the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately following Mr. Starchik’s address to the
    jury, the trial judge told the jury to disregard what he had said about coming
    from Montreal to Toronto in such a hurry he didn’t have time to pack and that
    he’d been commanded to go to Toronto.  She told the jury there was <span class=GramE>no evidence to support his
    statements nor</span> any evidence from which any such inference could be
    drawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, she told them there was no evidence he was
    protecting anyone and no evidence from which they could make such an
    inference.  She did not give any
    direction in relation to his comments about his <span class=SpellE>impecuniosity</span>.  In our view, no harm was done as the result
    of this omission.  It would have been
    apparent to the jury, that in all likelihood, Starchik would have been
    represented by counsel if he were able to afford it, particularly in view of
    the very serious charge he faced.  The
    comment regarding the payment of the hotel bill, viewed in context, was of
    little significance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next motion for mistrial followed the Crown’s
    closing remarks.  In his closing
    submissions the Crown referred to the appellant as an “overseer” in relation to
    the events in question.  In his opening
    remarks, the Crown took the position that the appellant and his co-accused were
    engaged in a joint venture.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to defence counsel’s motion for a mis-trial
    on the basis of Mr.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Starchik’s</span> closing
    submissions to the effect that he had been “commanded” and Crown’s “overseer”
    theory, the trial judge said she had already ruled on Starchik’s remarks and
    instructed the jury accordingly. In relation to the Crown’s closing submissions,
    she ruled that provided there was an independent basis in the evidence to
    support the theory – independent of Starchik’s assertions – then the theory
    could go to the jury.  We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a difficult trial, with two accused where only
    one of whom was represented by counsel.  Ms. Atiban was a difficult and volatile witness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge did an admirable job in
    all the circumstances.  Her mid-trial
    instructions to the jury were clear and to the point.  In addition to her mid-trial instructions,
    the trial judge cautioned the jury in relation to Ms. Atiban’s evidence and
    provided a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. She
    re-iterated her instruction to disregard any evidence of the appellant’s bad
    character.  She repeated her instruction
    in relation to Mr. Starchik’s closing comments that were without evidentiary
    foundation. They jury would not have been left in any doubt about how they were
    to go about their task.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, we are of the view that the
    complaints made by the appellant, whether considered alone or cumulatively,
    would not support a motion for a <span class=SpellE>mis</span>-trial or
    rendered the trial unfair.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Sentence Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals the sentence imposed on the appellant.  The Crown submits that the sentence was not
    within the range for this quantity of drugs and this offender.  The Crown submits that the range for this
    offender is 5 to 12 years and not 5 to 9 years as the trial judge found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the Crown argues that the trial judge ought
    to have ordered that the appellant be required to serve half of his sentence
    before being eligible for parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, it is argued that the trial judge erred in
    failing to order that the appellant provide a DNA sample.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We called on the appellant to respond only to the
    argument in relation to the DNA order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in her careful reasons on sentence
    considered all the factors and concluded that a proper sentence for this
    offender was 8 years.  While the sentence
    could have been higher, we see no error in principle that would permit this
    court to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the parole eligibility order, the trial judge
    concluded that the Crown had not persuaded her that this exceptional measure
    was required in this case.  In our view, even
    accepting the Crown’s submission that <i>R.
    v. Zinck </i>modified or refined the approach set out in <i>R. v. Goulet </i>applied by the trial judge, it is apparent that the
    result would have been the same. We would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as for the DNA order we note that in her
    written reasons the trial judge ordered that the appellant provide a DNA
    sample.  At the time of sentencing
    however, after objection by defence counsel she appears to have changed her
    mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, violence is not a necessary pre-condition
    for making a DNA order.  Possession for
    the purpose of trafficking is a secondary designated offence under
    s.&nbsp;487.04 of the <i>Code</i> and
    accordingly it was open to the trial judge to impose a DNA order and she ought
    to have done so.  As Rosenberg J.A. of
    this court noted in <i>R. v. Hendy</i> “in
    the vast majority of cases” it would be in the best interests of the
    administration of justice to make the order.  This was a serious offence and not the appellant’s first conviction for
