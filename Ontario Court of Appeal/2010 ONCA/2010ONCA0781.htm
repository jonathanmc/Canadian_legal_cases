    adequately consider the character of the offender as mandated by s. 745.4 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> and by imposing a
    sentence based on circumstances which could not properly be treated as
    aggravating factors. He submits that the length of period of parole
    ineligibility imposed is not a fit sentence. The respondent’s position is that
    the sentencing judge did not err in principle and that the sentence imposed was
    not outside the range of fit sentences.</span></p>

    volunteer DNA samples and the appellant agreed to do so. The DNA and
    fingerprint evidence collected from the appellant proved that he was the
    assailant. The appellant was a 63 year old hard-working family man with no
    criminal record. </span></p>

    appellant testified that he had no recollection of the events.  He said that when he heard about the brand of
    cigarette stubs found outside the victim’s apartment, he questioned whether
    they were his. Initially, the defence proposed to call evidence of automatism
    induced by the consumption of alcohol and the appellant’s diabetes. However,
    after the appellant testified in chief, the defence elected to call no further
    evidence. Both counsel invited the judge to find the appellant guilty of second
    degree murder. The Crown requested a period of parole ineligibility of 20 years
    and the defence requested a period of 15 years.</span></p>

    sentencing judge clearly recognized that s. 745.4 was the governing section
    with respect to parole ineligibility. Section 745.4 provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to
    section 745.5, at the time of the sentencing under section 745 of an offender
    who is convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at the trial
    of the offender or, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of the same
    court may, having regard to the character of the offender, the nature of the
    offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendation,
    if any, made pursuant to section 745.2, by order, substitute for ten years a
    number of years of imprisonment (being more than ten but not more than
    twenty-five) without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    sentencing judge turned his mind to the relevant factors set out in s. 745.4:
    the character of the accused, the nature of the offence and the circumstances
    surrounding its commission. He referred to the fact that the appellant was 63
    years of age, was married with three children, expressed some remorse, had
    worked for most of his life and had no criminal record. The judge noted that
    the appellant indicated he had virtually no recollection of the offence and could
    offer no explanation for it. Although the Crown invited the judge to disbelieve
    the evidence of amnesia and to reject the expression of remorse, he did not do
    so. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    sentencing judge stated that he did not take issue with the mitigating factors
    outlined by the defence, including the accused’s age, lack of criminal record
    and the fact that much of the Crown’s evidence went in unchallenged.  However, he made no reference to the
    appellant’s health issues or to the defence medical report indicating that the
    appellant will not present a danger in the future. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the reference to the mitigating personal circumstances of the appellant was
    very limited, I am unable to conclude that the sentencing judge failed to

    s. 745.4. </span></p>

    appellant also argues that the sentencing judge failed to take into account all
    of the principles of sentencing and that he put too much emphasis on
    denunciation and deterrence. I disagree. In considering the sentence, the judge
    looked to the principles of sentencing and to the sentencing objectives and
    determined that denunciation and general deterrence were paramount and of
    primary consideration in this case. He was entitled to do so. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Aggravating Factors</span></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>T</span>he
    sentencing judge quite properly considered the following aggravating factors in
    this case: the planned and brutal nature of the attack; the sexual assault; the
    age and vulnerability of the victim asleep in her own home; and the impact of
    the crime upon the victim’s family and their small community.<span lang=EN-US> However, while enumerating the aggravating
    circumstances of the case before him, the sentencing judge also included the
    following: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Brunet doesn’t suffer from any psychiatric disorder.  Mr. Brunet, despite his amnesia, admitted to
    questioning his possible involvement when cigarette butts of the brand that he
    smokes were found in the vicinity by the police and he never thought to come
    forward with any information, even upon determining that.  There remains no explanation of any kind for
    the crime, for what happened here.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After listing the various aggravating factors,
    including the circumstances quoted above, the sentencing judge concluded that
    the cumulative impact of the aggravating factors in this case demanded a parole
    ineligibility period at the higher end.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent properly concedes that the absence of a
    psychiatric disorder and the failure to assist police in their investigation
    are not aggravating factors in this case. At most, these circumstances reflect
    an absence of mitigating factors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the absence of an
    explanation – regardless of whether the appellant was unwilling or unable to
    provide one - means that there is no basis to say that the appellant is any
    less dangerous now than he was the day before the commission of the
    offence.  The respondent relies on <i>R. v. Shropshire</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227,
    where the Supreme Court held that in some circumstances, the lack of an
    explanation for the commission of the offence can be an aggravating factor in
    sentencing. The respondent criticizes the appellant’s purported rationale for
    not explaining his conduct as a dubious claim of memory loss. However, the
    sentencing judge did not reject the appellant’s evidence of his amnesia. Therefore,
    unlike the situation in <i>Shropshire</i>,
    the lack of explanation in this case was not attributable to a deliberate
    refusal on the part of the accused. Rather, the appellant was unable to offer
    any insight into the offence because he had no recollection of even being
    inside the apartment. This was not an aggravating factor in the circumstances
    of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s position is that the sentencing judge
    did not turn absent mitigating factors into aggravating factors. It submits
    that having looked at certain aggravating factors, the judge quite properly
    considered circumstances that, in other cases, have served to attenuate those
    aggravating factors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. Such an interpretation is inconsistent with
    both the preceding and subsequent language used by the sentencing judge that
    clearly characterizes these facts as aggravating factors. It is also
    inconsistent with the submissions of the Crown at the sentencing hearing. The
    Crown invited the sentencing judge to disbelieve the appellant’s amnesia and
    find the lack of an explanation to be an aggravating factor. The Crown also
    submitted that the accused’s decision to keep silent during the investigation
    resulted in a delay in bringing closure to the victim’s family. As well, the
    Crown tendered two medical reports as exhibits, over the objection of the
    defence, for the stated purpose of showing that the accused was not suffering
    from a psychiatric or physical condition at the time of the offence. In these
    circumstances and reading the reasons as a whole, I am satisfied that the
    sentencing judge erred in considering these factors to be aggravating.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><u>Fitness
    of the sentence</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the sentencing judge commits an error in principle,
    the sentence imposed is no longer entitled to deference and an appellate court
    may impose the sentence it thinks fit. <i>R.
    v. Rahaman</i>, 2008 ONCA 1; <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Rezaie</span></i> (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The range of periods for parole ineligibility for
    second degree murder is 10 to 25 years. Although elements of first degree
    murder may have been present in this case, the conviction is for second degree
    murder and s. 745.4 requires the judge to consider not just the nature of the
    offence, but also the character of the accused in determining the period of
    parole ineligibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where a particularly egregious offence is coupled with
    the most aggravating of offender characteristics such as a history of violence
    and a high risk of recidivism, the uppermost range of 20 to 25 years will be
    appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a brutal and violent attack upon an elderly
    woman in her own home, involving a break and enter and a sexual assault. There
    are significant aggravating factors in the circumstances of the offence.  The murder of this helpless, 81 year old
    woman left a devastating mark on both her family and on the small community
    where she lived, as evidenced by the Victim Impact Statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, there are significant mitigating factors in
    this case. The appellant’s age, health, remorse and lack of criminal record are
    important considerations in arriving at a fit sentence. He was a hard-working
    family man.  His wife considered him to
    be a good husband and a good provider. The defence medical report apparently indicated
    that he will not present a danger in the future. As the sentencing judge noted,
    this murder was completely out of character.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the offence and the circumstances
    surrounding its commission need to be balanced against the character of the
    accused. In doing so, and in light of the aggravating and mitigating factors,
    as well as the sentencing principles, a period of parole ineligibility of 16
    years is a fit sentence for this offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
    appeal is allowed and the sentence is varied to provide for a period of parole
    ineligibility of 16 years.  </p>
