style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Emilia von Anhalt, appeals from
    the orders of Spence J. refusing to set aside the noting in default and
    granting default judgment in the amount of $776,710.74.  For the following reasons the appeal is
    dismissed, except that the amount of prejudgment interest is reduced to 3.3
    percent.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was formerly an officer and
    director of Lydia Diamond Exploration of Canada Ltd.  In November 2002, the Ontario Securities
    Commission made an order against her and her late husband under s. 127 of the <i>Securities Act</i> <i>inter alia </i>limiting the circumstances in which they could trade in
    the securities of Lydia Diamond.  In
    October 2004, the OSC received information that the appellant and her husband
    were continuing to sell Lydia Diamond securities in breach of the 2002
    order.  As a result, the OSC commenced a quasi-criminal
    prosecution of the appellant and her husband in late 2005.  While the appellant’s husband attended the
    trial, the appellant left the jurisdiction and was therefore tried <i>in</i> <i>absentia.</i>  She was eventually convicted and sentenced in
    2007 to a term of imprisonment.  There is
    also a warrant for the appellant’s arrest for charges of forgery and fraud
    allegedly committed in Toronto in 2005.  The appellant has apparently not been in Canada since 2005. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In November 2007, Pepall J. heard an application
    by the OSC which led to the granting of a security interest in the von Anhalts’
    shares in Lydia Diamond to named victims from the quasi-criminal
    proceedings.  Days before the hearing the
    appellant’s husband sold his securities to certain investors.  As a condition of obtaining court approval of
    the sale, these investors paid the bulk of the approximately $1.4 million
    purchase price into court.  Ultimately,
    these funds were distributed to various persons, including five of the
    victims.  The appellant did not provide
    any restitution and she has retained her shareholdings in Lydia Diamond.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In July 2008, the respondents commenced an
    action against the appellant alleging breach of contract, fraud, and fraudulent
    misrepresentation as a result of agreements the appellant had entered into with
    them but failed to honour.  While the
    respondents did not know where the appellant lived, they had an e-mail address
    for her and served her with the statement of claim by e-mail on July 3,
    2008.  An order for substituted served by
    e-mail was subsequently made on September 3, 2008.  On that date, the respondents’ counsel served
    the appellant with a copy of the order for substituted served and advised her
    that the respondents would be seeking default judgment.  The appellant did not respond or take any
    other steps and was noted in default on January 26, 2009.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In an order of December 21, 2009, Pepall J.
    allowed the appellant to exercise her dissent rights under s. 185 of the <i>Business Corporations Act</i> and provided
    for a payment into court by the new owners of Lydia Diamond of funds for the
    purchase of the appellant’s Lydia Diamond securities.  $400,000 has now been paid into court.  The respondents then brought their motion for
    default judgment, which was returnable on January 26, 2010.  The respondents, having learned that the
    appellant had retained Ontario counsel, served him with a motion record in
    support of the motion for default judgment.  The motion for default judgment was adjourned to allow the appellant to
    move to set aside the noting in default.  The appellant filed an affidavit in an attempt to explain her default
    and some of the circumstances under which she took money from the
    respondents.  She was cross-examined on
    her affidavit.  She did not cross-examine
    any of the respondents on their affidavits. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In brief reasons, the motions judge referred to
    the correct test for setting aside default judgment.  He noted that she was a fugitive from justice
    and did not file a defence in the action for a year and half even though she
    was aware of the action from the time it was commenced.  He found that she had put forward no credible
    evidence for her failure to defend the action.  He also took the view that the appellant did not dispute that she owed
    money to the respondents, she only disputed the quantum.  Therefore, it was not necessary to set aside
    the noting in default to deal with the question of quantum. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether to set aside a noting in default is a
    discretionary decision.  The court will
    look at the non-exhaustive list of factors including the behaviour of the
    plaintiff and of the defendant, the length of the defendant’s delay, the
    reasons for the delay and the complexity and value of the claim.  See <i>Metropolitan
    Toronto Condominium Corporation No. 706 v. Bardmore Developments Ltd.</i> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 278 (C.A.).  We have
    not been persuaded that the motions judge erred in dismissing the appellant’s
    motion to set aside the noting in default.  The appellant claimed that she did not defend the action because of lack
    of funds.  It was open to the motions
    judge to reject this claim given the evidence that she had access to funds
    which she used for other purposes.  The
    more probable explanation for her failure to defend and the lengthy delay is
    that the appellant had no intention to defend the action until she saw there
    was a possibility her Lydia Diamond securities might have some value following Pepall
    J.’s December 2009 order.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>The Default Judgment</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that the default judgment
    should be set aside because there is an inconsistency between some of the facts
    pleaded in the statement of claim and the evidence provided in the respondents’
    affidavits.  She also submits that the
    evidence provided in the affidavits does not support the amounts claimed.  Finally, she submits that there may be a <i>Limitations Act</i> defence to the claim by
    Tari Rinder.  Given all of these concerns
    with the evidence, the appellant submits that the motions judge should have
    exercised his discretion under rule 19.05(3) and ordered that the action
    proceed to trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We would not give effect to any of these
    arguments.  While the respondents’
    affidavits claimed for various sums they gave to the appellant, the motions
    judge limited judgment to amounts related to the shares in Lydia Diamond that
    the appellant promised to give to the respondents and which she never
    delivered.  In cross-examination, she
    admitted that she received the funds and that those funds went into a bank
    account over which she had sole control.  For example, in relation to the Parkinsons’ claim, she admitted that she
    did not dispute that funds were advanced; she only disputed the quantum.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A review of the affidavit evidence indicates
    that the respondents, some of whom were elderly and had lost their life
    savings, attempted to gather as much documentary evidence as possible to
    support their claims.  They were not able
    to provide documents for all of the claims but the motions judge had their
    sworn testimony as to the amounts they provided to the appellant.  He was fully entitled to act upon that
    evidence.  In the case of Brian
    Parkinson, the motions judge, having reviewed the evidence, substantially
    reduced the amount originally claimed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant points out an apparent
    inconsistency between the promissory note attached to Mr. Parkinson’s affidavit
    and the amount claimed in the affidavit.  Admittedly, the affidavit is somewhat confusing.  However, the explanation for some of the
    confusion is due to the fact that, as explained by Mr. Parkinson, part of the
    promissory note is missing. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We are also not persuaded that there is a
    material inconsistency between the facts pleaded in the statement of claim and
    the affidavit evidence.  The facts in the
    statement of claim indicate that the appellant induced the respondents to enter
    into share subscription and option agreements pursuant to which she purported
    to sell shares in Lydia Diamond.  She did
    so at a time when she had no authority to engage in sales of Lydia Diamond and
    when there was no prospect that the shares would be traded on a recognized
    exchange.  She never delivered the shares
    nor did she pay back the amounts provided by the respondents.  The affidavit evidence is consistent with
    those facts.  The fact that some of the
    funds may have originally been provided as loans to the appellant is not
    material to the appellant’s liability for the amounts advanced by the
    respondents.  And, as we have noted above,
    the appellant does not dispute that she owed some amount to the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, assuming a <i>Limitations Act</i> defence was <span class=GramE>available,</span> there is evidence as to when the respondents discovered their claim which would
    defeat any such defence.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>Prejudgment interest</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents concede that the rate of
    prejudgment interest should be reduced from 5 percent to 3.3 percent.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>DISPOSITION</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, except for an amendment to
    paragraph 3 of the Judgment to reduce the rate of prejudgment interest to 3.3
    percent, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $12,500 inclusive of
    disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
