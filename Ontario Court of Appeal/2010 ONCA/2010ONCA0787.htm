  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>London Caulking and Installations Limited appeals from
    the January 2009 judgment of Quinn J. in the third party action requiring
    London Caulking to pay $916,452 to Essex Condominium Corporation No. 28 on
    account of damages and pre-judgment interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff in the main action is Loretta <span
class=SpellE>Corchis</span>. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> owned a unit
    on the top floor of the east tower of a condominium complex registered in the
    name of Essex. She claimed that she and her husband were unable to use her
    condominium unit during the five year period between June 1994 and June 1999
    because of continuous water leaks. She sought damages against Essex for breach
    of contract and for negligence for failing to keep the roof of the condominium
    complex in a proper state of repair. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main action was commenced in 1995 and tried before
    Quinn J. in 2005. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> obtained judgment
    against Essex for $719,058.30 on account of damages and pre-judgment interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the main action, the trial judge concluded that
    Essex acted unreasonably in hiring London Caulking to repair the roof of the
    condominium complex in October 1994 in the face of expert reports indicating
    more extensive repairs or replacement of the roof were necessary. The trial
    judge also found that Essex acted unreasonably between 1995 and 1998 in continuing
    to take advice from and enter into contracts with London Caulking during 1995 and
    in failing to take alternate action when the London Caulking’s roof repairs did
    not resolve the water leaks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1998, Essex issued a third party claim seeking
    contribution and indemnity from London Caulking for any amounts Essex was
    required to pay Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span>. London Caulking did not
    defend the main action. The third party action was tried before Quinn J. in
    2009. The trial judge held London Caulking largely responsible for the amounts
    Essex was required to pay Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> based on
    negligent misstatement, negligence and breach of contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issues on appeal are whether the trial judge
    erred in his findings of liability and damages in the third party action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although we accept that it was open to the trial judge
    to find London Caulking liable for breach of contract, we conclude that the
    trial judge erred in his award of damages against London Caulking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The Water
    Leaks and the Roof Repairs</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> began
    experiencing water leaks in her condominium unit in June 1994. In response to her
    complaint about these leaks, Essex obtained expert reports from an architect and
    an engineer recommending extensive repairs to the roof of the east tower or
    replacement of the roof of the east tower at a cost of about $130,000. After
    these reports were obtained, a majority of the Essex Roofing Committee
    recommended that the Board proceed with replacing the roof. However, William
    Docherty, the original developer of the condominium complex, and Constantine
    Bach, a unit owner and retired engineer, did not agree with this recommendation
    and suggested that minor repairs would be sufficient. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In mid-September 1994, representatives of London
    Caulking examined the roof and expressed a verbal opinion that the roof was in
    good condition and that London Caulking could stop all leaks. A representative
    of Essex wrote to London Caulking on September 16, 1994. In that correspondence
    Essex’s representative advised that time was of the essence in relation to the
    roof, asked for a detailed proposed and inquired how long it would take to stop
    all leaks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated September 19, 1994, London Caulking
    responded that it had “been involved with inverted rubberized asphalt roofing
    for over 20 years” and asserted that its “experience indicates that failures
    are usually isolated conditions caused by details, moving seams, or inflicted
    damages.” London Caulking stated that work on the east tower roof would take
    about two weeks and could be completed for less than $20,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a meeting held on October 15, 1994, Essex decided to
    repair the roof rather than replace it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 17, 1994, Essex requested that London
    Caulking prepare a bid for conducting repairs to the roofs of the east and west
    towers and a recreational centre of the condominium complex in accordance with
    specifications prepared by Mr. Bach. London Caulking submitted a proposal “to
    complete necessary leak repairs and preventative procedures to the roofs of the
    three buildings” at a cost of about $47,000. The proposal required Essex to
    provide the location of all leaks and stated, “[o]<span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>ur</span></span> labour and materials are guaranteed for two years
    in the areas of work completed.” Essex issued a purchase order for that work on
    October 21, 1994. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>London Caulking initially completed its work on
    November 18, 1994. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> reported further
    leaking on November 27, 1994. London Caulking completed additional repairs on
    February 9, 1995. Despite these repairs, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis’s</span> condominium unit continued to leak.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 1, 1995, London Caulking delivered a two-year
    guarantee to Essex in which it agreed “to correct and repair ... any deficiency
    in their work ... as a result of improper workmanship or incorrect materials
    for a period of two years from the date of substantial completion”. Although
    not referred to in London Caulking’s original proposal, the Guarantee stated
    there were no “representations, warranties or conditions express or implied”
    other than as set out the Guarantee, and required that Essex give written
    notice of any deficiencies within 20 days of discovery of the deficiency. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 23, 1995, Essex faxed a letter to London
    Caulking advising that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis’s</span> unit continued
    to experience leaks after repairs were completed on February 9, 1995 and that
    although the leaks had subsequently “been stopped ... freezing weather made it
    impossible to ascertain whether the repairs were successful.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 1995, Essex entered into further contracts
    with London Caulking to perform additional work to the exterior walls of the
    complex considered necessary to assist in stopping the leaks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in April 1998, Essex retained another
    engineering firm to investigate the roof. The engineering firm concluded that
    the repairs completed by London Caulking, which mainly involved replacement of
    the weatherproofing membrane in selected areas, would not have been 100%
    effective in addressing the previously reported leaks because there were other
    areas where water could penetrate if those areas were not repaired. Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Corchis’s</span> condominium unit stopped leaking after a new roof
    was installed in accordance with the engineering firm’s recommendation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The Main
    Action</b> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, London Caulking did not defend the
    main action, and accordingly, although apparently present throughout, did not
    participate in the trial of the main action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the trial of the main action,
    counsel for Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> and for Essex filed an Agreed
    Statement of Fact. Although the trial judge said, in his reasons, that he did
    not regard the Agreed Statement of Fact as binding on the court, he observed
    that most of the evidence led at trial was not in dispute and supported the
    facts agreed upon. Accordingly, the trial judge made 81 findings of fact
    mirroring the Agreed Statement of Fact submitted by counsel. However, the trial
    judge noted that the issue in the case “was not what had occurred, but what
    interpretation should be placed on what had occurred.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the analysis section of his reasons relating to the
    main action, the trial judge concluded that Essex did not act reasonably in
    1994 when it rejected the advice of the engineer and the architect it had
    retained and instead relied on the advice of London Caulking, William Docherty
    and Constantine Bach concerning the steps that should be taken to fix the roof
    of the east tower. The experts recommended extensive repairs or a new roof at a
    cost of $130,000. London Caulking, Mr. Docherty and Mr. Bach “reported that the
    [east] roof was in excellent condition and required only minor repairs at a
    cost of $20,000.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the trial judge concluded that Essex
    failed to act reasonably in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In 1995, Essex failed to
    act reasonably by continuing to accept advice from London Caulking. In 1996,
    1997 and 1998, Essex failed to act reasonably by doing nothing to resolve the
    ongoing roof leaks until April 1998, when it retained an engineering firm to
    investigate the roof. The engineering firm concluded that the life expectancy
    of the roof had expired. The roof leaks stopped after a new roof was installed
    in accordance with the engineering firm’s recommendation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on his findings that Essex failed to act
    reasonably, the trial judge awarded damages to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span>.
    In accordance with an agreement between Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> and Essex, the trial judge ordered Essex to pay Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> $719,058.30 on account of damages and pre-judgment interest plus $299,221.00 on
    account of costs for a total of $1,018,279.30.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The October
    2005 Motions</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2005, Essex moved for an order that the
    trial judge’s findings of fact and the quantum of damages in the main action
    were binding on London Caulking and “for directions as to those factual issues
    that arise between [Essex] and [London Caulking] that have been determined by
    operation of the Orders and determinations made in the main action.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, London Caulking moved for an order that the
    findings of fact made and the quantum of damages fixed in the main action would
    not be binding on it and for an order perpetually staying or dismissing the
    third party action because of a secret agreement reached between Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Corchis</span> and Essex concerning liability. As part of its
    argument, London Caulking relied on <span class=SpellE><i>Merrett</i></span><i> v. Lyons</i>,
    [1958] O.J. No. 316 (C.A.), claiming that that case stands for the proposition
    that an agreement as to damages between and plaintiff and a defendant is not
    binding on  a third party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions were heard on April 24, 2006; Quinn J. released
    his reasons on May 2, 2006. The motion judge dismissed London Caulking’s
    motion. He concluded that issues relating to the evidence adduced after the
    secret agreement concerning liability had been reached could be addressed at
    the trial of the third party action. Further, he found that evidence had been
    led to support Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis’s</span> damage claim during the
    trial of the main action and that the measure of damages in the third party
    action was the same as the measure of damages in the main action “i.e. what
    damage did plaintiff sustain from water leakage.” The motion judge concluded, “<span
class=GramE>the</span> judgment for damages in the main action is binding in
    the third party action subject to arguments with regard to liability.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>London Caulking’s motion for leave to appeal the May 2,
    2006 decision to the Divisional Court was dismissed on January 19, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The Third
    Party Action</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third party action was heard over seven days in
    November and December 2008 and the trial judge released his reasons on January
    20, 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge noted that, in addition
    to the Agreed Statement of Fact and the agreement concerning damages, Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Corchis</span> and Essex entered into an agreement near the end of
    the trial concerning liability that they did not disclose to the court. The
    trial judge said the witnesses called after the agreement was entered into “had
    no effect on the court’s finding of liability”. Rather, the finding of
    liability was based on the fact that Essex “obtained [two professional reports
    recommending roof replacement] and then ignored the reports in favour of pseudo
    roof experts who advocated a cheaper roof repair solution.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge once again noted that London
    Caulking failed to defend the main action and that it was therefore bound by
    relevant orders or determinations made in the main action. He repeated his 81
    findings of fact made in the main action “as they [were] binding where relevant
    in the Third Party proceeding and … chronicle[d] the facts in dispute.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning liability, the trial judge found London
    Caulking liable for negligent misstatement, negligence and breach of contract. London
    Caulking’s negligent misstatement consisted of representing that it could offer
    a permanent solution to the roof leaks without determining what was causing the
    leaks. Its negligence consisted of carrying out spot repairs over identified
    leaks without determining what portions of the roof membrane were bonded and
    whether water could flow along the deck. London Caulking breached its contract
    with Essex by failing to fulfill its commitment “to complete the necessary leak
    repairs and preventative procedures.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge rejected London Caulking’s
    argument that Essex’s claim was barred by London Caulking’s two-year Guarantee
    since the work was completed in 1995 and the third party claim was not issued
    until June 26, 1998. The trial judge said, “[t]here were continual complaints
    from [Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span>] about roof leaks and these
    complaints were known by London”. He found that London was on site from 1994 to
    1997 or 1998 and that “throughout, [it] attributed the leaks to causes other
    than their repairs.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons relating to damages consisted
    of a single paragraph. He noted the total damages agreed upon in the main
    action including costs ($1,018,279.30) and observed that they were based on a
    period of loss of Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> from June 1994 to June
    1999. As London Caulking “was not involved with the roof repairs until after
    October 15, 1994”, the trial judge reduced Essex’s entitlement to contribution
    and indemnity “by one-tenth or six months.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Discussion  </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge’s finding of liability
    based on negligent misstatement cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> To make out a
    cause of action for negligent misstatement, among other requirements, a
    claimant must show that it relied, in a reasonable manner, on the negligent
    misrepresentation of the defendant: see <i>Queen
    v. <span class=SpellE>Cognos</span> Inc. </i>[1993] 1 S.C.R. 87, at p. 110. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge’s findings in the main
    action preclude a finding of reasonable reliance. In his reasons for judgment in
    the main action, the trial judge made an explicit finding that Essex did not
    act reasonably in 1994 when it “rejected the advice of its two professional
    experts and accepted the advice of London Caulking” and others. In addition,
    the trial judge said, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whatever standard is imposed, this issue should
    have been within the Board members’ abilities … The difficulty was that the
    Board members were so influenced by costs that they neglected to ask questions.
    The Board members had before them two detailed written reports by an architect
    and an engineer. The Board rejected the detailed opinions contained in the two
    reports by acknowledged experts and accepted an oral opinion from dubious
    experts that the roof was in excellent condition and required only minor repairs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Even assuming
    that Essex could show it had a “special relationship” with London Caulking (another
    essential element of a cause of action for negligent misstatement), the trial
    judge’s findings in the main action preclude a finding of reasonable reliance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, we are satisfied that it was open to the
    trial judge to find London Caulking liable to Essex for breach of contract. The
    negotiations that preceded London Caulking’s October 19, 1994 letter to Essex
    provide background context for interpreting the language of London’s proposal.
    Particularly in the light of that context, it was open to the trial judge to
    conclude that the proposal “to complete the necessary leak repairs and
    preventative procedures” amounted to a promise to provide a “permanent solution
    to the roof leaks and not repairs to selected roof locations.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis’s</span> unit leaked from 1994 until 1998, when a new roof was installed. Based on the
    evidence of the engineer hired by Essex in 1998, he also found that the work
    carried out by London Caulking was not sufficient to resolve the leaking
    problem. In our view, on the basis of these findings, it was open to the trial
    judge to find, as he did, that London Caulking breached its contract with Essex
    because it failed to take necessary preventative measures to stop the leaks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, we agree with the trial judge’s conclusion
    that London Caulking could not rely on the terms of its Guarantee to exclude
    its liability in the circumstances. The original terms of the agreement between
    the parties did not specify any terms apart from a two-year warranty. Moreover,
    Essex provided London Caulking with written notice of ongoing leaks in March
    1995 and London Caulking was well aware of the ongoing problem with leaks. In
    all the circumstances, London Caulking is not entitled to rely on the terms of
    the warranty to absolve itself from liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, we conclude that the trial judge erred in
    assessing damages because he failed to turn his mind to the issue of causation.
    Particularly in the light of the trial judge’s strong findings in the main
    action concerning the negligence of Essex, it was necessary that the trial
    judge address the issue of causation before holding London Caulking liable to
    Essex for the damages suffered by Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s core findings against Essex were
    that, in the face of two expert reports Essex had obtained, Essex was negligent
    in hiring London Caulking in the first place and then in continuing to take
    advice from London Caulking and in failing to take alternate steps more quickly
    when the solutions offered by London Caulking did not work. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The leaking problem started and Essex obtained the two
    expert reports the trial judge found Essex should have relied on before London
    Caulking was ever on the scene. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> did not have
    a contract with London Caulking; nor did she sue London Caulking. London
    Caulking’s liability to Essex for damages suffered by Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span> therefore turns on the extent to which London Caulking’s wrongful conduct
    caused Essex to incur liability to Ms. <span class=SpellE>Corchis</span>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is demonstrated by the chronology set out above,
    this matter has had a long and tortured history. In these circumstances, rather
    than ordering a new trial to address the issue of causation, we consider it
    appropriate that we exercise our power under s. 134 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>c</span>. C. 43
    to make an appropriate award of damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, given the trial judge’s findings of fact,
    it is reasonable to conclude that London Caulking’s conduct in negotiating and
    performing its contract caused some part of Essex’s delay in taking proper
    steps to fix the roof on the east tower. While we conclude that Essex must bear
    primary responsible for this delay because of its own negligence, we consider
    it reasonable to fix London Caulking with responsibility for about three months
    out of the total 60 months of delay, resulting in an award of $50,913.97 on
    account of damages. Having regard to the fact that London Caulking was paid a
    total of $58,920.86 including tax for its work under the contract for roof
    repairs this amount seems to us to be eminently reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we consider it unnecessary to
    determine whether this was a proper case for findings of concurrent liability
    for breach of contract and negligence. We see no realistic possibility that we
    would have arrived at a different result had we analyzed the issue based on a
    finding of negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the trial judge’s award of damages is set
    aside, and an award of $50,913.97 is substituted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the limited success of Essex against
    London Caulking, we set aside the trial judge’s order requiring London Caulking
    to indemnify Essex for the costs it was required to pay the successful third
    party, Constantine Bach. Further, we set aside the trial judge’s order
    requiring London Caulking to pay Essex costs of the main action and the third
    party proceeding in the amount of $173,476.00 and substitute an order requiring
    London Caulking to pay Essex trial costs totalling $12,500. Finally, we make no
    order as to the costs of this appeal. </p>
