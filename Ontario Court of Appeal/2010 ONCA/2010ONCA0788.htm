  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consulate Ventures Inc., the respondent on appeal,
    brings a motion for an order removing Mr. Alan Lenczner as counsel for the
    appellants on this appeal.  The respondent
    contends that Mr. Lenczner, who was retained by the respondent briefly in
    respect of the same matter some 11 years ago, cannot act for the appellants on
    this appeal.  Counsel for Mr. Lenczner
    submits that, in the circumstances, Mr. Lenczner can act on the appeal for the
    appellants without compromising either his duty of confidentiality to the
    respondent or his obligations to his present clients, the appellants.  </p>
  <h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h3>
  <h3>THE RELEVANT FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was involved in the development of an
    outlet mall in Windsor, Ontario between 1997 and 1999.  Shortly before the mall went into operation,
    the respondent’s services were terminated by the developers.  Mr. Sorokolit, the president of the
    respondent, sought legal advice from Mr. Lenczner.  He arranged to meet with Mr. Lenczner and forwarded
    to him material relevant to the matter, including a chronology and summary
    prepared by Mr. Sorokolit.  Mr. Lenczner
    and an associate met with Mr. Sorokolit in Mr. Lenczner’s offices in August
    1999 for about two hours.  The firm
    billed the respondent for its services.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Sorokolit recalls meeting with Mr. Lenczner at his
    offices in August 1999.  Mr. Lenczner had
    reviewed the material and expressed his views about the strength of the
    respondent’s case.  There was also advice
    about a letter that should be written to the other parties to the dispute and
    some discussion about obtaining a certificate of pending litigation.  Mr. Sorokolit acknowledges that many of the
    documents provided to Mr. Lenczner are now part of the trial record and are no
    longer confidential.  He further
    indicates, however, that the chronology and commentary prepared by him and
    given to Mr. Lenczner are still confidential documents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not surprisingly, Mr. Lenczner has no present recollection
    of the meeting in August 1999.  He had no
    further connection to the dispute and the ensuing litigation until September of
    this year when he was approached by the appellants to act on the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequent to the meeting with Mr. Lenczner, the
    respondent retained other counsel, including Mr. Cotter.  The dispute ultimately proceeded to trial in
    November and December 2003.  In November 2004,
    the trial judge dismissed the respondent’s claims.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent appealed the dismissal.  This court allowed the appeal in part and
    directed a new trial on the respondent’s <i>quantum
    meruit</i> claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new trial proceeded in March and April of
    2010.  The respondent was successful on
    the new trial.  The appellants have
    appealed from the judgment on the new trial by Notice of Appeal dated June 11,
    2010.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Lenczner, after being retained by the appellants in
    September 2010, wrote to Mr. Cotter requesting a short extension of time to
    perfect the appeal.  The respondent objected
    to Mr. Lenczner’s involvement based on his prior involvement in the matter in
    1999 and this motion ensued.</p>
  
  
  <h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h3>
 
  <h3>THE DISPUTE</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to begin with what is not in
    dispute.  No one questions Mr. Lenczner’s
    integrity, honesty or professionalism.  All
    are of the highest order.  It is also
    accepted that Mr. Lenczner has no recollection of anything that was discussed
    with Mr. Sorokolit in August 1999.  Indeed,
    until Mr. Cotter brought the matter to Mr. Lenczner’s attention, he had no
    recollection of ever meeting Mr. Sorokolit or acting for the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on this motion comes down to this – Mr.
    Lenczner genuinely believes that he can act for the appellants on the appeal
    without in any way compromising any ongoing duty of confidentiality he owes to
    the respondent and without compromising his duty of undivided loyalty owed to
    his present clients, the appellants.  Mr.
    Underwood, counsel for Mr. Lenczner, submits that absent any realistic
    possibility that a conflict could emerge in the course of the appeal, no
    positive purpose is served by removing Mr. Lenczner from the record and denying
    the appellants their counsel of choice on the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cotter, for the respondent, does not question Mr.
    Lenczner’s <i>bona fides</i>.  He submits, however, that where a lawyer
    purports to act against a former client in the very same matter, there is an
    irrebuttable presumption of a sufficient risk of the misuse of confidential
    information to require that the lawyer be disqualified.  Mr. Cotter further submits that entirely apart
    from confidentiality concerns, a lawyer owes a duty of loyalty to a former
    client which forecloses acting against that former client in the same
    matter.      </p>
  <h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>IV</h3>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel disagree on the proper characterization of the
    circumstance in which Mr. Lenczner proposes to act for the appellants on
    appeal.  For Mr. Cotter, the advice given
    by Mr. Lenczner in 1999 to the respondent and his proposed representation of
    the appellants on the appeal in 2010-2011 involve exactly the same matter – the
    dispute between the respondent and the appellants arising out of the
    development of the mall.  Mr. Cotter
    submits that the question is a straightforward <span class=GramE>one,</span> can Mr. Lenczner act in the same matter at different times for the opposing
    parties?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Underwood submits that for the purposes of this
    motion, the “matter” cannot be characterized generically as the dispute arising
    out of the outlet mall development.  Mr.
    Underwood characterizes the “matter” presently between the respondent and the
    appellants by reference to the issues that the appellants propose to raise on
    appeal.  Mr. Lenczner will advance
    relatively narrow grounds of appeal relating to the treatment of the
    respondent’s expert’s evidence of valuation and the trial judge’s refusal to
    admit evidence of valuation from the appellants’ expert.  Mr. Underwood contends that the merits of the
    motion must be determined having regard to the very different contexts in which
    Mr. Lenczner’s legal advice was sought by the respondent in 1999, in respect of
    pre-litigation matters and now some 11 years later, in respect of the specific
    issues to be argued on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are practical problems with the approach articulated
    by Mr. Underwood.  The scope of any
    appeal is not defined exclusively by the appellant much less by the appellant’s
    grounds of appeal.  The respondent and
    the court have something to say about the scope of an appeal.  An approach to claims of conflict which
    presumes that the ambit of an appeal can be accurately and exhaustively
    predetermined is not suited to the prophylactic purpose of the conflict rule.  Motions like this one are intended to avoid
    potential conflicts before they actually arise in the course of the proceeding.  That purpose is not served if one assumes
    that the proceedings will be limited to a specific narrow issue when there is a
    real possibility that the issues will expand beyond that narrow range: see <i>R. v. Widdifield</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d)
    161 (C.A.), at pp. 175-76.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the practical difficulties with defining the
    “matter” on which a lawyer has been retained strictly by reference to the
    grounds of appeal, that approach is unduly orientated towards the lawyer rather
    than the former client.  I prefer a
    functional approach which asks the question, from a reasonable client’s
    perspective, what was the matter on which that client retained the lawyer and what
    is the matter on which that same lawyer now proposes to act against his former
    client?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed from the perspective of the reasonable former client,
    I think Mr. Lenczner was retained in 1999 to advise the respondent as to its
    rights and remedies in respect of the dispute between the respondent and one or
    more of the appellants relating to the development of the mall in Windsor.  Viewed from the same perspective, Mr.
    Lenczner is now retained by the appellants to challenge on appeal the trial
    judge’s determination of the respondent’s legal rights and remedies in respect
    of the dispute over the development of the mall that initially arose in 1999.  Both Mr. Lenczner’s advice to the respondent
    in 1999 and his services for the appellants in 2010 relate to the same subject
    matter, albeit viewed from the perspective of two very different stages of the
    legal process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that the two retainers relate to the
    same subject matter, I turn now to Mr. Cotter’s arguments in support of his
    claim that Mr. Lenczner cannot act.  There are two submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Mr. Cotter submits that Mr. Lenczner received
    confidential information from the respondent in 1999.  The evidence to that effect is
    unchallenged.  Mr. Cotter goes on to
    contend that as the appeal relates to the same subject matter, there is an
    irrebuttable presumption that if Mr. Lenczner acts for the appellant, there is
    a risk that the confidential information will be used against the interests of
    the respondent.  Mr. Cotter further
    submits that if he overstates the effect of the presumption when he describes
    it as irrebuttable, the presumption can only be rebutted by cogent evidence negating
    the risk of the misuse of the confidential information.  A solicitor’s honest assertion that he has no
    recollection of the content of the confidential information will not suffice.  Memories can come and go, especially when
    refreshed by reference to events that one believes to have been long
    forgotten.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel relies heavily on the analysis in <i>MacDonald Estate v. Martin</i>, [1990] 3
    S.C.R. 1235.  <i>MacDonald Estate</i> goes at least as far as to place the onus on the
    solicitor who is acting against a former client to demonstrate that there is no
    risk of the misuse of confidential information.  I am not sure that <i>MacDonald
    Estate</i> goes so far as to declare an irrebuttable presumption that there is
    a risk of the misuse of confidential information whenever a lawyer purports to
    act against a former client in the same matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I hesitate to support a rule drawn so broadly as to always
    require disqualification based on the assumption that there is always a risk of
    the disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases where a lawyer purports to act against a former client in
    the same matter, there is virtually no risk of any disclosure of confidential
    information.  Indeed, this may be one of
    those cases.  I see little value in anchoring
    a rule disqualifying the lawyer on what in some cases would be a pure legal
    fiction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The resolution of this motion does not, however,
    require me to decide whether the presumption relied on by the respondent is
    irrebuttable and, if not, whether Mr. Lenczner has successfully rebutted
    it.  I am satisfied that the respondent
    succeeds on the second argument made by Mr. Cotter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel submits that lawyers owe a duty of loyalty to
    their former clients.  That duty is not
    premised on or confined to confidentiality obligations, but flows from a
    broader concept of fidelity that is essential to the proper functioning of the
    client/solicitor relationship.  Clients
    must be able to speak frankly and without fear of exposure to their lawyers
    about their legal problems.  To do so,
    clients must be confident that their lawyers will not become their adversaries’
    lawyers at some subsequent point in the course of the same dispute.  The prospect of one’s lawyer switching sides
    must undermine the confidence essential to the operation of the
    client/solicitor relationship.  There is
    also concern that if lawyers act against former clients in the same manner, the
    public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession will suffer.  That confidence is crucial to the effective
    and just administration of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Rules of
    Professional Conduct</i> <i>of the Law
    Society of Upper Canada</i> (“<i>Rules</i>”)
    offer cogent support for the duty of loyalty relied on by the respondent.  Rule 2.04(4)(a) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       A
    lawyer who has acted for a client in a matter shall not thereafter act against
    the client or against persons who were involved in or associated with the
    client in that matter</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>in</span> the
    same matter[.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No doubt, the <i>Rules</i> are not binding on the courts:  <i>MacDonald Estate </i>at p. 1245.  The <i>Rules</i> are, however, a clear expression of the profession’s concept of the duties owed
    to former clients.  That expression must
    be given considerable weight by the courts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court long ago recognized a broad obligation not
    to act against former clients in the same dispute.  In <i>Re R.
    and Speid</i> (1983), 43 O.R. (2d) 596, a very strong panel of this court dealt
    with a Crown motion to disqualify the accused’s lawyer.  That lawyer’s partner had acted for the
    accused’s wife in the same investigation.  She was now a principal Crown witness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dubin J.A., speaking for himself, Martin J.A. and
    Robins J.A. (both former Treasurers of the Law Society), said this at p. 600:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A client has a right to professional services.  Ms. Nugent [the witness] had that right as
    well as Mr. Speid [the accused].  It was
    fundamental to her rights that her <span class=GramE>solicitor respect</span> her confidences and exhibit loyalty to her.  A client has every right to be confident that the <u>solicitor retained
    will not subsequently take an adversarial position against the client with
    respect to the same subject matter that he was retained on.  That fiduciary duty, as I have noted, is not
    terminated when the services rendered have been completed.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Speid</i> and
    similar cases have been aptly described by P. Perell (now Perell J.) in <i>Conflicts of Interest in the Legal
    Profession</i> (Toronto:  Butterworths,
    1995) at pp. 38-42 as the “turncoat cases”.  In these cases, disqualification is not based on confidentiality
    concerns but rather “the need to foster and maintain public confidence in the
    integrity of the legal profession and in the administration of justice.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Underwood, in his effective submissions, tries to
    distinguish <i>Speid</i> by pointing out
    that there was a very real and obvious conflict between the witness and her
    former lawyer.  Her former lawyer was
    testifying at the accused’s trial and revealing statements made to him by the
    witness for the purpose of discrediting her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that <i>Speid</i> involved an actual breach of confidentiality and a blatant conflict of
    interest.  I do not think, however, those
    aggravating factors detract from the general application of the principle set
    out in the passage quoted above.  Dubin
    J.A. clearly does not tie the duty of loyalty exclusively to the duty of
    confidentiality.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law governing the disqualification of lawyers who
    purport to act against former clients was considered in some detail in <i>Brookville Carriers Flat Bed GP Inc. v.
    Blackjack Transport Ltd.</i> (2008), 263 N.S.R. (2d) 272 (C.A.).  In that case, a lawyer purported to act
    against a former client in a different but related lawsuit.  There was no risk that the lawyer could
    compromise his former client’s confidences by acting against him in the second
    lawsuit.  Cromwell J.A., for the court,
    held that the lawyer was properly disqualified.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cromwell J.A. reviewed the case law, including <i>Speid</i> and the authoritative texts at
    length.  He concluded that lawyers had a
    duty of loyalty to former clients that was rooted both in confidentiality
    concerns and the need to foster and maintain public confidence in the
    client/solicitor relationship and the due administration of justice.  He said at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This broader continuing duty of loyalty to <u>former
    clients is based on the need to protect and promote public confidence in the
    legal profession and the administration of justice.</u>  What is of concern is the spectre of a lawyer
    attacking or undermining in a subsequent retainer the legal work which the
    lawyer did for the former client or of a lawyer effectively changing sides by
    taking an adversarial position against a former client with respect to a matter
    that was central to the previous retainer.    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cromwell J.A. went on to consider whether the two
    lawsuits in issue in <i>Brockville Carriers</i> were sufficiently “related” to justify disqualifying counsel.  As I have already explained, I do not regard
    the two retainers in issue here as merely “related”.  Mr. Lenczner’s retainers involve the same
    matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Underwood submits that there is no duty of loyalty
    owed to former clients.  He relies on <i>Bolkiah v. KPMG</i>, [1999] 2 A.C. 222 (H.L.).  He submits that the Law Lords held that the
    only duty owed by a lawyer to a former client is the duty to preserve the
    confidentiality of information imparted to the lawyer by the former
    client.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The passage relied on from <i>Bolkiah</i> is directed at a comparison between the obligations to a
    present client and those owing to a former client.  The case was about confidential
    information.  In my view, it cannot be
    taken as holding that a lawyer’s professional obligations to a former client
    extend only to maintaining confidences.  Nor, in my view, does the case address the power of the courts to
    restrain a lawyer from acting in a manner which undermines public confidence in
    the due administration of justice.  Those
    issues did not arise in <i>Bolkiah</i>.  In any event, if Mr. Underwood’s
    interpretation of <i>Bolkiah</i> is correct,
    it is inconsistent with both <i>Speid</i> and <i>Brookville Carriers</i>.  I agree with the analysis in those
    cases.  </p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his concurring judgment in <i>MacDonald Estate</i>, Cory J., at p. 1265, recognized that applications
    to disqualify lawyers require the court to balance the maintenance and
    integrity of the justice system, the rights of the litigants to counsel of
    choice, and the desirability of preserving mobility within the legal profession.  He went on to say, at p. 1265: “Of these
    factors the most important and compelling is the preservation of the integrity
    of our system of justice.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the priority given to the preservation of
    the integrity of the process.  In my
    view, that goal finds expression in the <i>Rules
    of Professional Conduct</i> cited above and in the controlling
    jurisprudence.  A lawyer’s obligation,
    whether described as a duty of loyalty owed to a former client, or as a
    professional obligation to promote public confidence in the legal profession
    and the administration of justice dictates that Mr. Lenczner cannot act on this
    appeal against the respondent, his former client.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion is granted and an order shall go removing
    Alan Lenczner and the firm of Lenczner Slaght Royce Smith Griffin LLP as
    counsel of record for the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:avoid'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think this motion was necessary to resolve the issue.  Given the nature of the issue, each party
    should bear its own costs.  </p>
