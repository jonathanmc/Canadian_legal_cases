  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the duty of an insured to disclose
    a material change in risk to an insurer.  Allstate appeals the judgment of Spiegel J., based on a jury verdict,
    granting the respondent’s<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> claim for coverage under an Allstate policy for automobile insurance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first question posed by the trial judge to the jury
    was “Has the defendant satisfied you that the use of the motor vehicle by
    Matthew Sponagle, the respondent’s son, constituted a material change of risk”?  The trial judge instructed the jury that a
    material change of risk was a change that a reasonable insurance company would
    consider to be material.  The jury
    answered question number one in the affirmative.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second question put to the jury was as
    follows:  “If your answer to Question No.
    1 is YES, did Ana Algarvio satisfy the obligation of promptly notifying
    Allstate or its agent of the material change in the risk?”  The trial judge told the jury there were two
    parts to question two.  Reading his
    charge as a whole, we are satisfied that the jury would have understood
    question two to involve both parts referred to by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the first part of question two, the trial judge
    told the jury that the law only imposes an obligation to notify an insurer of a
    material change in risk if a reasonable person would have known that the
    insurance company would regard as a material change the use of a motor vehicle
    by a driver under 25 holding a G2 licence.  He told the jury that if they were not satisfied that a reasonable
    person in the respondent’s circumstances would have understood the need to
    notify to maintain coverage, then there was no duty to notify and the answer to
    question two was “yes”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge told the jury that the second part of
    question two only came into play if they concluded that there was a duty to notify.  If the jury found a duty to notify, then they
    should decide whether the respondent had satisfied the jury that she complied
    with that duty.  There was no objection
    to the charge and, according to the trial judge, counsel asked him to put the
    questions in the manner we have described above.  The jury answered question two in the
    affirmative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allstate argues that there was no evidence on which the
    jury could have answered question two in the affirmative.  In particular, Allstate contends that the
    respondent had an obligation to notify it or its agent that she allowed her 16-year-old
    son to drive the vehicle after his motor vehicle licence changed from G1 to
    G2.  Allstate submits there was no
    evidence that the respondent did so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these arguments.  In our view, there was evidence to support
    the jury’s answer to question two.  The
    respondent testified that in December 2002, she informed an Allstate agent that
    her son had received a G1 driver’s licence.  She faxed the licence information to the agent.  The agent told her to call when her son
    received his G2 licence.  There was no
    evidence, however, that the agent told the respondent that her son would not be
    covered as a G2 driver until she notified them of the change.  Sometime after her discussion with the
    Allstate agent, the respondent received a notice of increased premium for the
    year April 2003 to April 2004.  She
    testified that she assumed this increase occurred because her son had been
    added to the policy.  In fact, the
    increase occurred because of speeding tickets.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent testified that when her son received his
    G2 licence in the fall of 2003, she attempted to call the Allstate agent three
    or four times without success.  She often
    got a busy signal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Allstate disputed much of the respondent’s
    evidence.  However, the jury was entitled
    to accept her evidence in its entirety and the jury’s findings are entitled to
    deference in this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, on the basis of the respondent’s evidence,
    it was open to the jury to answer question two in the affirmative.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was open to the jury to conclude that a reasonable
    person in the circumstances described by the respondent would not have known
    that Allstate would regard the change in Matthew’s licence status from G1 to G2
    as a material change in the risk requiring notification to maintain
    coverage.  If the jury reached that
    conclusion, then, as the trial judge instructed, they were to answer question
    two in the affirmative.  As the trial
    judge put it, “[i]f you find a reasonable person wouldn’t know, then you are
    going to answer that question [question two], “yes”, she satisfied the
    obligation because there was no obligation”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allstate also complains that the trial judge unduly
    intervened in the examination-in-chief of an Allstate witness.  We would not give effect to this
    argument.  Allstate <span class=GramE>was
    represented</span> by very experienced counsel who did not object to the
    questioning, nor did he ask that the jury be excused in order to raise the
    matter.  Indeed, at one point during the
    examination-in-chief, the jury was out of the courtroom and counsel did not
    raise the matter in the jury’s absence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Allstate has not demonstrated any prejudice
    arising from the trial judge’s intervention either generally or on the basis that
    Allstate did not have an opportunity to put its case fully before the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allstate did not pursue its other grounds of appeal in
    oral argument.  We would not give effect
    to them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.  Costs are awarded on a partial indemnity
    scale in favour of the respondent, fixed in the amount of $18,442.93, inclusive
    of disbursements and applicable taxes.  </p>
