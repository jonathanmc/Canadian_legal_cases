  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue at trial and on this appeal is
    whether the appellants’ ss. 8 and 9 <i>Charter</i> rights were breached and, if there were <i>Charter</i> breaches, whether the evidence that the appellants were carrying handguns
    should be excluded under s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the very skilful argument advanced by Ms.
    Presser, acting as duty counsel on behalf of both appellants, we are not
    persuaded that the evidence at issue was obtained in breach of ss. 8 and/or 9,
    and even if it was, that it should be excluded under s. 24(2). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants challenge the trial judge’s finding that
    the police had reasonable and probable grounds for arrest and that the police
    therefore were entitled to conduct the personal searches at issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming, without deciding, that the police did not
    have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants, there was still
    ample evidence to support a valid investigative detention of both
    appellants.  Their behaviour in the taxi
    was suspicious and evasive.  Their posture
    and body movements indicated that they could be carrying concealed weapons or
    drugs.  Finally, and most significantly,
    their flight from the police when the taxi stopped, combined with their earlier
    behaviour, provided the police with grounds for an investigative detention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the police conducted a “pat
    down” search of Telfer and a “cursory” search of Dene.  These findings bring both searches within the
    category of “a protective pat-down search of the detained individual” to ensure
    officer safety that is permitted in the context of an investigative detention: <i>R. v. Mann</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59 at para.
    45</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, even if, as the appellants submit, the
    searches exceeded what would be permitted in the context of an investigative detention,
    we would not interfere with the trial judge's conclusion that the evidence
    should not be excluded under s. 24(2).  Putting
    the appellants’ case at its highest, the searches barely exceeded the
    permissible limits.  The <i>Charter</i>-infringing state conduct was not
    serious; the impact of the breach on the <i>Charter</i>-protected
    interests of the appellants was minor; and the state’s interest in adjudication
    of the case on the merits is high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no merit in Telfer’s submission that the trial
    judge should have recused himself on grounds of reasonable apprehension of
    bias.  The trial judge indicated his
    tentative views only to prompt debate on the <i>Charter </i>issue and a reasonable observer would conclude that his
    mind remained open to argument and persuasion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no basis upon which we can interfere with the
    sentences of 8 years for Telfer and 5½ years for Dean before credit for
    pre-trial custody.  While these sentences
    appear to us to be at the high end for these offenders and these offences, we
    see no error of principle that would justify appellate interference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge took into account the youth of both
    appellants.  This is a situation where
    Parliament has prescribed a minimum term and a penitentiary sentence was
    inevitable. Both appellants had prior criminal records.  Telfer’s record includes a prior weapons
    conviction which triggered a minimum five-year sentence.  While Dene’s record was considerably less
    serious, it did include a prior conviction for drug trafficking and the
    offences were committed in an area plagued by drug dealing and handguns.  We are unable to accept the submission that
    the sentences imposed amounted to an unjustified “jump” from the previous
    sentences imposed upon these offenders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the sentence
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
