    jury’s answers to the questions put to them.  Before turning to those, it is useful to
    consider the appellants’ version and the security guards’ version of what happened.
     The trial judge summarized the appellants’
    version at para. 4 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiffs’
    evidence was that they were going to Mr. Gentles’ home, an apartment in 200 <span
class=SpellE>Sherbourne</span>, which he shared with his mother. They parked
    Mr. Gentles’ truck behind 39 Pembroke, walked to that street and south to the
    entrance to the courtyard. On turning into the courtyard, they were immediately
    and aggressively confronted by the guards as to what they had been doing behind
    39 Pembroke, and Mr. Gentles explained that they had permission to park there
    and were returning home and that he was a tenant of apartment 301. The
    plaintiffs said that Mr. Collins pressed them on what they were doing behind 39
    Pembroke and became enraged when Mr. Gentles queried what business it was of
    his, so much so that he called on his radio for backup. Mr. Gentles, himself a
    security guard at the time, understood the significance of the call: more guards
    and the police would be coming. He then stated that he would move to the
    sidewalk and await the arrival of the other guards. When he attempted to do so,
    Mr. Collins jumped him from behind, got him down and banged his face into the
    pavement several times. Other guards arrived and handcuffed the plaintiffs and
    they sat on the ground in custody until the police arrived and took charge. The
    police ascertained that Mr. Gentles was a tenant and released the plaintiffs.
    No charges were laid against anyone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=X-NONE>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge summarized the
    security guards’ version at para. 5:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendants’ evidence was that they observed the
    plaintiffs emerging from the laneway and heading towards the courtyard. Because
    of the reputation of the lot behind 39 Pembroke, they were interested in the
    plaintiffs, whom they did not recognize as tenants. Mr. Collins spoke to them
    and Mr. Gentles responded, using vulgar language and refusing to give any
    information. The request and the response were repeated a couple of times and
    Mr. Collins said that if they did not live on the property, they would have to
    leave. Mr. Collins described Mr. Gentles as taking up a fighting stance with
    fists clenched and raised. He said he called for backup and told Mr. Gentles
    that if they did not leave they would be arrested for trespass. They did not
    move to leave and so Mr. Collins reached out and touched Mr. Gentles on the
    shoulder to arrest him. Mr. Gentles’ response was to punch or shove Mr. Collins
    hard on the shoulder, so that he was driven back a couple of steps. He then
    went at Mr. Gentles and got him in a headlock, which he maintained, albeit with
    much difficulty, until the backup arrived and handcuffed Mr. Gentles. In the
    meantime, Mr. Barnes told Mr. Francis to stay out of it and went to help Mr. Collins.
    When he saw Mr. Gentles in the headlock, Mr. Francis went to help his cousin by
    pulling Messrs. Collins and Barnes off him. Mr. Barnes then turned back to Mr.
    Francis and held him until the backup arrived. When he saw the new officers
    arrive, Mr. Francis lay down on the ground.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Messrs. Collins and
    Barnes denied that the plaintiffs had ever said that they were tenants in the
    whole course of this episode.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>As can be seen, in both
    versions the security guards took the initiative to approach Gentles and Francis
    and question them.  In Gentles and
    Francis’ version, Gentles identified himself as a resident at the outset, but
    he told the security guards they had no right to ask questions about what they
    were doing in the laneway from which they were emerging after parking there.  Collins and Barnes testified that Gentles
    never identified himself in the whole course of the episode.  Both sides agree the security guards called
    for backup.  After the call for backup
    was made, the appellants say that Gentles offered to wait on the sidewalk.  The security guards deny this happened.  The security guards testified that they warned
    Gentles and Francis “that if they did not live on the property, they would have
    to leave”.  They add that when Gentles
    and Francis made no move to leave, Collins arrested Gentles by touching him on
    the shoulder.  Gentles agrees he was
    arrested, but says that Collins jumped on him.  Both sides agree there was a physical struggle
    but blame the other side for initiating it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge put 39
    questions to the jury.  The first
    section, “Factual Issues Re Arrest”, contained 19 questions.  The second section had three questions about “Issues
    Re Excessive Use of Force”.  The third
    section addressed any “Negligence” of Intelligarde and Toronto Housing and the
    final section dealt with “Damages”.  </span></p>

    respondents and dismissed the appellants’ action entirely.  This appeal is taken only from the trial judge’s
    dismissal of the appellants’ action for false arrest, assault and imprisonment
    against the Intelligarde respondents.  T</span><span

lang=X-NONE>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>Because of the narrowness of
    the appeal, only the first 22 questions, which dealt with the events of June
    14, 2001, and questions 31 to 35 that deal with general and aggravated damages
    need be reviewed.  The remaining
    questions are not directly relevant to the appeal.</span></p>

    inconsistent.  As well, in answering
    several questions, the jury could not seem to choose between the competing
    versions of the events and so purported to apply the burden of proof.  The trial judge, however, did not seek
    clarification of the jury’s answers and no party requested that he do so.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>A. Factual Issues re Arrest</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.&nbsp;
    Upon encountering the plaintiffs in the courtyard, did Collins take steps to
    determine if they were trespassing?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes
    based on the “Burden of Proof”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 1 was “yes”, specify the steps taken by Collins to
    determine if the plaintiffs were trespassing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. According
    to Collins and Barnes’ testimony they did try to ask if they “live here” and testified
    that the response was “we don’t have to tell you anything”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.&nbsp;
    Was Gentles belligerent and/or vulgar in his answers to Collins’ questions?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.&nbsp; Did
    Gentles act in a physically intimidating manner towards Collins or Barnes prior
    to his arrest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.
    Collins COULD have interpreted Gentles’ actions as physically intimidating. <span
class=GramE>No to Barnes.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.&nbsp; Did
    Gentles advise Collins or Barnes that he would wait on the sidewalk after the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.&nbsp;
    Did Gentles punch or strike Collins prior to Collins jumping on Gentles?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.
    The “punch or strike” may not have been intentional but rather a reflex
    reaction of invasion of personal space.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>13.&nbsp;
    If the answer to question 12 was yes, did Collins act in self-defence in
    grappling with Gentles?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes
    with possible misinterpretation of Gentles’ reaction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>14.&nbsp;
    Was the arrest of Gentles a reasonable course of action in all of the
    circumstances?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. No</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 14 was “no”, then please provide particulars of your
    reasons for so finding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. We feel
    that Gentles did identify himself as a resident but some other circumstances
    justified this as a reasonable course of action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>16.&nbsp;
    Did Francis hit or strike Barnes or Collins or attempt to pull Collins off
    Gentles before Barnes advised Francis that he was under arrest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes. We
    feel that Francis attempted to pull Collins off of Gentles and in the process
    Barnes interpreted this as a hit or strike.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17.&nbsp;
    Did Barnes hold an honest belief that Francis was guilty of assault prior to
    arresting him?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>18.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 17 was “yes”, on what was this belief based?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. See Q.

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Trial
    Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=X-NONE>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge noted at para.
    13 of his reasons that “once the plaintiffs have proved the arrest, the onus
    shifts to the defendant to establish, to the civil standard, that he had
    reasonable and probable cause to believe, and did believe, that an offence was
    being committed.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>In understanding the jury’s
    findings of fact, the trial judge started with the jury’s response to question
    8, that Collins had an honest belief that Gentles was trespassing prior to
    arresting him.  The trial judge
    recognized that, in answering question 6, the jury had found that Gentles
    identified himself to the security guards as a resident of 200 <span
class=SpellE>Sherbourne</span> prior to the arrest.  The trial judge resolved this apparent
    inconsistency by referring to the jury’s answer to question 9, that “Collins
    may have been pre-occupied enough to ‘miss’ the statement from Gentles stating
    that he ‘lived here’”.  While the trial
    judge describes this part of the jury’s answer as speculation on their part, he
    did not dismiss it as such but went on to treat it as a finding of fact in his
    analysis.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge took the view
    of the evidence that the only possible “preoccupation” that could have
    distracted Collins was Gentles’ “attack” on him.  The trial judge referred to Collins’
    testimony at para. 16 saying, “Mr. Collins’ testimony was clear: he learned
    that Mr. Gentles was a tenant only much later.”  Thus, the trial judge reconciled the jury’s
    answers to questions 6 and 8 by surmising that Gentles must have identified himself
    as a resident during the physical struggle when Collins would have been
    understandably “preoccupied” with subduing Gentles.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge recognized the
    obvious problem with this reconciliation of questions 6 and 8.  The physical struggle that took place after
    the arrest could not have been the preoccupation that caused Collins to miss a
    statement that was made before the arrest.  The problem arises because the jury found as a
    fact that Gentles had </span><span lang=X-NONE>identified himself as a resident of 200 <span class=SpellE>Sherbourne</span> <u>prior to the arrest</u> and it was undisputed that the physical struggle took
    place after the arrest.</span><span lang=X-NONE> </span></p>

    this inconsistency by proceeding to reason that the jury must have “viewed the
    arrest as occurring when Mr. Gentles was subdued, rather than when he was f</span><span

    as I think is the logical way to reconcile these answers, Mr. Gentles only said
    [he was a tenant] in the co</span><span lang=X-NONE>urse of the struggle, it
    was then too late to affect the lawfulness of the original arrest”. </span></p>

    appellants’ counsel’s argument that there could never be a lawful arrest of a
    tenant under the TPA.  He then turned his
    attention to whether the security guards had reasonable and probable grounds to
    arrest Gentles and Francis.  He stated
    that there were subjective and objective aspects to this question.  The security guards had to subjectively
    believe Gentles and Francis were trespassing, and the objective circumstances had
    to be “such that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would
    believe that the plaintiffs had committed the offence”. </span></p>

    subjective element of “reasonable and probable grounds” to arrest Gentles was established.  The jury had found in answering question 8

lang=X-NONE>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>As for the objective element,
    the trial judge explained that the jury had largely accepted the guards’
    version of what had happened.  He
    concluded that the security guards’ version “clearly” established the objective
    element required.  In one paragraph he
    summed up the circumstances that, in his view, established reasonable and
    probable grounds:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>19. If matters transpired as
    the guards described them, there was clearly reasonable and probable cause for
    believing that the plaintiffs were trespassing. The jury’s answers largely
    accepted the guards’ evidence as to these events. The answers establish that
    the guards approached two persons, unknown to them, whose reaction to being
    questioned was a vulgar and totally uninformative refusal to answer. On being
    pressed to respond there was more vulgarity and one, the plaintiff <span
class=GramE>Gentles</span>, adopted an aggressive stance. Upon being warned
    that if they did not live there, they would have to leave or be arrested for
    trespass, they did not leave.</p>

lang=X-NONE>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge continued on to
    set out his understanding of some of the jury’s answers and how they
    demonstrated that the jury preferred the guards’ testimony over the appellants’.
     However, in the rest of his decision, he
    does not set out any additional circumstances that support the existence of an
    objectively reasonable belief that Gentles and Francis were trespassers. </span></p>

    jury’s finding that Gentles had identified himself as a resident and reiterated
    why that statement was not a circumstance that Collins could or should have
    considered.  At para. 20, the trial judge
    repeated his analysis of questions 6, 8, and 9 and went on to assert that the
    jury “rejected the evidence that Mr. Gentles stated at the beginning that he
    lived there”.  He repeated his conclusion
    that Gentles identified himself as a resident only after the physical struggle
    started.  According to the trial judge, after
    the physical struggle had started, Collins could reasonably dismiss Gentles’ statement
    that he was a resident as a mere stratagem.  The trial judge added that Collins did not
    hear Gentles’ statement that he was a resident, and in any event, the statement
    was made too late to affect the lawfulness of the earlier arrest.</span></p>

    to the jury, he explained, because of the Supreme Court’s reasons in <i>R. v. Asante-Mensah</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 3.  In<i> Asante-Mensah</i>, Binnie J. speaking for the unanimous court indicated at
    para. 74 that, in the context of the TPA, the question whether the force used
    to arrest was reasonable “may have to have regard not only to what force is
    necessary to accomplish the arrest, but also to whether a forcible arrest was
    in all the circumstances a reasonable course of action in the first place.”  Thus, question 14 was relevant only if
    reasonable and probable grounds to arrest existed. </span></p>

lang=X-NONE>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>In question 14 the jury found that </span><span lang=X-NONE>the arrest of
    Gentles was “not a reasonable course of action in all of the circumstances”.</span><span
lang=X-NONE>  However, in apparent
    contradiction, the jury’s answer to question 15 was, “</span><span lang=X-NONE>We feel that Gentles did identify himself as
    a resident but some other circumstances justified this as a reasonable course
    of action.”  </span><span lang=X-NONE>The
    trial judge took the view that the jury’s answer to question 14 modified their
    answer to question 15.  While the jury
    had not indicated what circumstances they had in mind in their answer to question
    15, the trial judge went on to find that “[t]he justifying circumstances, as
    found by the jury in other answers, include that Mr. Collins did not hear any
    such statement, the aggressive and non-responsive attitude of Mr. Gentles, the
    punch/strike in response and that Mr. Collins acted in self-defence in
    grappling with Gentles.”  </span></p>

lang=X-NONE>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>On this reasoning, the trial
    judge concluded that the Intelligarde respondents had “established the
    existence of reasonable and probable cause to initiate the arrest and to
    continue it by subduing the resistance of Mr. Gentles with no more force than
    was reasonably necessary.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>As for the arrest of Francis,
    the trial judge found that “Mr. Barnes warned Mr. Francis to stay out of the fight”
    but Francis intervened and assaulted Barnes.  The trial judge referred to Francis’ own testimony
    that when “he went to aid Mr. Gentles, his first physical contact was with Mr.
    Barnes, whose arm he grabbed in the effort to pull him off Mr. Gentles.”  This, the trial judge said, was “certainly” an
    assault and provided Barnes with reasonable and probable grounds to arrest
    Francis. </span></p>

    concluded that, since there were reasonable grounds for the arrest and since no
    excessive force was used, there was no basis for allowing any damages to
    Gentles.  The jury’s finding in answering
    question 31 — that there had been interference with Gentles’ reasonable
    enjoyment of his right to occupy his mother’s rental unit — did not matter
    because the respondents had not committed any tort “which could give rise to a
    duty on the landlord to take any active step to remedy the position in which
    the tenant found himself.  What is
    alleged is not an active interference with the tenancy, such as an illegal
    entry, but a failure to act in a situation which gave rise to no legal duty to
    act.”</span></p>

    additional or clarifying questions to the jury.  There is no appeal from the trial judge’s
    failure to seek clarification of the jury’s answers on his motion. Nor is there
    any appeal from the trial judge’s original formulation of the questions.  This appeal must be decided on the same basis
    as the motions of the parties before the trial judge had to be decided.  That is on the basis of the jury’s answers to

    residents.  The excepting words of the

    again:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If matters transpired as the guards described them,
    there was clearly reasonable and probable cause for believing that the
    plaintiffs were trespassing. The jury’s answers largely accepted the guards’
    evidence as to these events. The answers establish that the guards approached
    two persons, unknown to them, whose reaction to being questioned was a vulgar
    and totally uninformative refusal to answer. On being pressed to respond there
    was more vulgarity and one, the plaintiff <span class=GramE>Gentles</span>,
    adopted an aggressive stance. Upon being warned that if they did not live
    there, they would have to leave or be arrested for trespass, they did not
    leave.</p>

    11 p.m., were unknown to the security guards.  While the guards knew many of the residents, the
    housing complex was so large that — as their counsel on appeal recognized — the
    guards did not know all of the tenants, nor were they expected to.  The fact that Collins and Barnes did not
    recognize Gentles and Francis has no logical connection to whether or not they
    were residents.  Collins and Barnes
    needed some reason to believe that Gentles and Francis were trespassers rather
    than residents they did not recognize. </span></p>

    security guards were in the courtyard and spoke to the [appellants] as they
    passed.”  It is uncontested that Gentles
    and Francis were merely walking towards Gentles’ apartment building, a building
    with a locked front door.  As the trial
    judge puts it in the passage above, the appellants were “questioned”.  The jury’s answer to question 2 indicates that
    Collins and Barnes asked Gentles and Francis if they “live here”.  Gentles and Francis’ response to being
    questioned was, as the trial judge put it, “a vulgar and totally uninformative
    refusal to answer.”</span><span lang=X-NONE>  </span><span lang=EN-US>Collins testified that Gentles responded by saying “FU, we do not have

    aside, the statement that Collins attributed to Gentles is an accurate
    statement of the law.  Gentles and
    Francis were not required by the TPA or any other legal principle to respond to
    the question whether they lived there.  The
    Intelligarde respondents’ counsel concedes, as he must, that while security
    guards have the right to ask questions, tenants have the right to refuse to
    answer them.  Since that is so, the
    refusal of an individual not recognized by security guards to identify himself as
    a resident provides no reason to think that he is on the premises in
    contravention of s. 2 of the TPA. </span></p>

    that a person’s refusal to answer is expressed in a belligerent and vulgar manner
    does not provide a basis for reasonably believing he is not a resident.  The use of vulgarity adds nothing to the

    reasonable basis to believe that a trespasser was more likely to use vulgar

    next circumstance is that, rather than respecting the young men’s right to
    refuse to answer their questions, the security guards, as the trial judge put

    residents who stand on their rights and refuse to answer will eventually relent
    when “pressed” to do so.  Such an
    assumption is not grounded in reason.  Additional
    rounds of questions and refusals add nothing to the legal principle that

    they did not live there. </i> Their
    failure to leave after being given this direction could logically be taken to
    be an indication that they did live there.  In fact, the form of the direction could be
    taken to show that Collins did not know whether Gentles and Francis were
    residents.  In my view, this “direction” to
    leave the premises amounts to nothing more than another request that Gentles
    and Francis enlighten the security guards as to whether they were residents.</span></p>

    residents do not commit an offence by refusing to leave the premises if

    crack pipes smoking crack.  Given the
    security guards’ concerns and the fact that they did not recognize the young
    men emerging from the laneway, it is perhaps understandable that the guards would
    want to watch them.  The guards went
    further and questioned them, as they could.  Nothing prevents security guards from asking anyone

    for the Intelligarde respondents’ submission that Gentles failed to disengage

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    no legal principle was cited for the proposition that Gentles was required to
    disengage.  He was going home when
    stopped, “questioned” and “pressed” to respond by the security guards.  It seems to me that this submission signals a
    failure to grasp that Gentles and Francis did not have to respond to questions
    by security guards.  Absent reasonable
    grounds to believe Gentles and Francis were trespassers, it was the security
    guards who had to disengage from the confrontation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    there is no reason to think that a resident is more likely than a trespasser to
    disengage from a confrontation that security guards have initiated by
    submitting the person to “questioning” and have continued by “pressing” them to
    respond.  Gentles’ failure to disengage
    has no logical bearing on the question of whether he was a resident or a
    trespasser. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    third point relates to the findings of the jury and not the trial judge’s
    version of the facts.  I discuss, in the
    next section of these reasons, why the trial judge was wrong to explain away
    the jury’s unequivocal finding that Gentles identified himself as a resident
    prior to the arrest.  As Gentles
    identified himself prior to the arrest, it cannot be said that he refused to
    disengage from the confrontation. </span></p>

    turn then to the oral submission that the fact that Collins and Barnes were
    acting as they were trained to was a factor supporting the existence of
    reasonable and probable grounds.  This
    submission lacks a factual foundation since there was no specific jury finding
    on the point.  However, I deal with it at
    some length to fully address the Intelligarde respondents’ arguments.</span></p>

    security guards’ training could conceivably be relevant to assessing their
    subjective belief that they have grounds to arrest.  Subjective belief in the existence of grounds

    objective grounds. </span></p>

    advancing the argument, counsel referred the court to Barnes’ testimony.  Barnes was cross-examined extensively as to
    why, upon seeing two young men they did not recognize, the security guards did
    not simply continue to watch them for a moment or two to see if they had a key
    to enter the locked building they were walking towards.  The suggestion put to Barnes in cross-examination
    was that, if Gentles and Francis used a key to enter the building, the guards
    could be satisfied that they were not trespassers.  Barnes responded by indicating that continuing
    to watch individuals to see if they could gain access to the property was not
    what they were trained to do.  That
    response led to the following exchange:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.
    Okay. So your training wasn’t to watch and see what would unfold but to act
    immediately more or less?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;<span lang=EN-US>A. Yes.</span>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.
    Now, you’ll agree with me that that might tend to provoke or contribute to

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;<span lang=EN-US>Q. That instead of -- if your training is not to watch and see what

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;<span lang=EN-US>A. I see it as a preventive measure.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;<span lang=EN-US>Q. But you can see how it could easily lead to a confrontation or an

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;<span lang=EN-US>A. I’m still -- I’m not exactly sure how to answer your question. I mean
    if we approach somebody politely and address them in a professional manner, I
    don’t see how that could provoke a fight.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.
    All right. Seems to me that one of three things -- maybe there’s more -- but
    one of three things could have happened if you just watched for a moment
    instead of acting on that night. <span class=GramE>One, they might have
    continued through to <span class=SpellE>Sherbourne</span> and left the

    Yes.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.

    applies where the evidence is “absolutely even in your mind”.  Finally, he told the jury that the burden of
    proof lay generally upon the appellants, except on the issue of self-defence.  Significantly, the trial judge did not tell
    the jury that once the appellants established they had been arrested without
    warrant, the burden of proof shifted to the respondents to prove that the
    warrantless arrest was lawful.</span></p>

    jury showed diffidence in responding to a number of questions.  In some of their responses the jury recounted
    testimony without indicating they accepted it.  In other responses they speculated what “could”
    or “may” have been the case.  Here, too,
    the jury stopped short of making findings of fact.  As will be seen, the trial judge treated some

    findings of facts elicited by those questions.  Nevertheless, the parties moved for judgment
    instead of asking the trial judge to put additional questions to the jury to
    clarify its responses.  The result is
    that the parties had to advance their positions on those facts the jury did
    find.  Where the jury was unable to
    answer a question, the parties could not rely on a matter in evidence as a fact
    in meeting their respective burdens of proof.  If the claimed matter was crucial to the

    no dispute that the arrest of the appellants was warrantless.  The appellants did not need to rely on the
    findings of the jury to meet their burden of proof.  The main issue at the trial was whether the
    respondents met the burden of proof on them to establish they had reasonable
    and probable grounds to arrest the appellants.  The inability of the jury to find facts has a
    greater impact on the respondents because, in order to meet their burden of

    security guards approached them and said, “You guys are trespassing.  What were you guys doing back there?”  According to Gentles, he explained that he was
    a resident of 200 <span class=SpellE>Sherbourne</span>, but the guards
    continued to press them on what they had been doing in the laneway.  Collins testified in chief that he first said “something
    to the regards of, Hey, were you guys hanging out back there?”  After being reminded by his counsel that he
    could not recall his exact words he testified that he had said “something to
    the effect of why were they hanging out back there or were they hanging out
    back there.”  He went on to explain that
    he spoke to them “—because it’s a bit of an odd area.  I wanted them—to let them know that it’s part
    of our patrol route, and another reason would be to let them know it’s a high
    crime area, and another reason was just to ask them—you know, let them know we
    patrol this area and try and get them to identify themselves as being residents
    or not.”  Under cross-examination,
    Collins said he gave the appellants the opportunity to identify themselves
    several times.  Barnes testified that
    Collins repeatedly asked the appellants if they lived there and what they were
    doing on the property, and that the appellants refused to answer.  Barnes made no mention about asking the
    appellants what they were doing in the laneway.</span></p>

    lay generally upon the appellants, except on the issue of self-defence.  They apparently understood the trial judge’s

    in understanding what happened that was especially important to the trial judge’s
    analysis.  The jury’s findings of fact do
    not explain how Collins could honestly believe Gentles was a trespasser
    (question 8) when Gentles identified himself as a resident before the arrest
    (question 6).  To fill this gap, the

    preoccupied enough to miss Gentles’ statement that he was a resident, was
    speculation.  He explicitly identified
    this comment as speculation. Speculation falls short of a finding of fact.  The trial judge should have disregarded the
    comment as speculation and given full effect to the jury’s unequivocal finding
    that Gentles identified himself as a resident prior to the arrest.  Instead, the trial judge treated the jury’s

    understanding of the legal framework for the answers, it was his duty to
    provide further instructions and to seek clarifying answers.  Once the trial judge was satisfied that he
    could proceed to entertain the motions for judgment on the jury’s answers, he
    was bound to decide those motions on the basis of those answers.  He was wrong to embark on his own process of

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    times he stated as a fact that Collins did not hear Gentles’ statement.  There was no jury finding to that effect.  The jury’s finding that Collins honestly believed
    Gentles was a trespasser is equally compatible with Collins hearing the
    statement but not believing it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>What’s more, the trial judge’s
    finding of fact that Gentles did not identify himself as a resident until the
    physical struggle was unsupported by the record.  Both Collins and Barnes testified that the
    statement was not made at any time during the incident.  They testified that they learned Gentles was a
    resident only after the police arrived.  On
    the other hand, both Gentles and Francis testified that Gentles made the
    statement at the outset of the encounter.  These were the only two versions between which
    the jury had to choose.  Counsel
    suggested that Collins’ testimony allowed for the possibility that he did not
    catch everything Gentles said during the physical struggle. Still, some
    evidence was necessary that Gentles made the statement during the struggle.
    There was none.  The only evidence about
    the timing of the statement was that it was made earlier.  The trial judge’s finding that it was made
    later had no basis in the evidence. </span></p>

lang=X-NONE>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge went on to
    attribute his finding of fact to the jury.  He stated that the jury “rejected the evidence
    that Mr. Gentles stated at the beginning that he lived there”.  The question put to the jury, on a record in
    which the only evidence was the Gentles made the statement at the beginning,
    was whether Gentles made his statement “prior to the arrest”.  The jury gave a clear answer to the question
    put to them.  The basis on which the

    judgment, the trial judge should have accepted as facts that Gentles identified
    himself as a resident prior to the arrest and that Collins had an honest belief
    that Gentles was a trespasser.  The first
    of these facts was pertinent to the objective component of reasonable grounds
    for the arrest.  The second was relevant

lang=X-NONE>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge also erred in
    his attempt to resolve the inconsistency between the jury’s answers to
    questions 14 and 15.  In answering
    question 14, the jury said that “no”, the arrest of Gentles was not a
    reasonable course of action.  Then, in
    answering question 15 the jury said “We feel that Gentles did identify himself
    as a resident but some other circumstances justified this as a reasonable
    course of action.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The trial judge resolved the
    obvious inconsistency between these two answers by reasoning that the jury had “modified”
    their answer to question 14, effectively from “no” to “yes”.  The jury’s answers to these two questions are
    simply inconsistent.  The trial judge
    should have recognized this instead of preferring one answer over the other.
    Fortunately, the jury’s inconsistent answers to these two questions do not
    affect this appeal.  As noted earlier,
    these questions were included to determine whether, assuming there were
    reasonable and probable grounds to arrest, the arrest was a reasonable course
    of action in the first place.  Since
    there were no reasonable and probable grounds, the answers to these two
    questions are irrelevant and it is not necessary to resolve the inconsistency
    between them. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=X-NONE>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>Another example of the trial
    judge’s fact-finding is his finding that Francis committed an assault on
    Barnes.  If the question of whether
    Francis assaulted Barnes was important to the Intelligarde respondents’ case,
    they should have ensured that the question was put to the jury.  I will have more to say about the trial judge’s
    error in making this finding later in discussing the lawfulness of the arrest

    elicited by the questions worked to the appellants’ disadvantage in the trial
    judge’s assessment of their credibility.  For example, the trial judge made much of the
    fact that the jury did not believe Gentles’ testimony that he was not
    belligerent or vulgar.  In fact both
    sides had accused the other of being vulgar and belligerent and both sides
    denied being vulgar, but the jury was only asked if the appellants had been.  The jury’s rejection of Gentles’ testimony on
    this matter cannot be taken to indicate the jury preferred the credibility of
    the security guards, when the jury’s view of the security guards’ denial they
    had been vulgar was not even sought. </span></p>

    the trial judge did not follow a consistent approach to the questions in which
    the jury refrained from answering and instead speculated about what “could” be
    the case.  He treated as a fact the jury’s
    speculation that Collins may have been preoccupied and so missed Gentles’
    statement that he was a resident.  On the
    other hand, he did not take into account the jury’s speculation that Gentles’ “punch
    or strike” may not have been intentional but a reflex reaction to the invasion
    of personal space.  Despite this comment,
    he stated that the jury found that Gentles reacted </span><span lang=X-NONE

    about Gentles’ reaction to the unlawful arrest fall short of establishing, on a
    balance of probabilities, that Gentles committed an assault.  Placing the words in quotes, the jury said
    that “[t]he ‘punch or strike’ may not have been intentional but rather a reflex
    reaction of invasion of personal space.”  Consequently, subduing Gentles for resisting
    the unlawful arrest could not be a valid exercise of the power of arrest under
    s. 494(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i>.  Rather, the use of force to attempt to
    implement an unlawful arrest will generally constitute a further assault on the
    person arrested: <i>Plummer</i> at para. 49. </span></p>

    Intelligarde respondents’ statement of defence does not expressly plead the

     However, read extremely generously, it
    may be taken to allege that Francis was arrested for assault.  The jury, though, was not asked whether
    Francis committed an assault.  It was
    asked only whether Barnes honestly believed that Francis was guilty of assault
    prior to arresting him.  </span><span

    been a live one, it would have been necessary to instruct the jury about the
    possible application of s. 27 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  Section 27 justifies the use
    of force reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence likely to
    cause immediate and serious injury to a person.  In taking on the role of fact-finder, the
    trial judge did not consider the evidence that Gentles testified that he could
    not breathe and that he lost consciousness while being held in a headlock by
    Collins.  On the record, it would have
    been open to the jury to find that Francis did not commit an assault on
    Collins, but rather was seeking to prevent what could reasonably be perceived
    as an assault on Gentles that was likely to cause him serious injury.  The findings of fact that the jury did make
    are not sufficient to establish that Barnes could have arrested Francis using
    the <i>Code</i> power of arrest.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.&nbsp;
    Upon encountering the plaintiffs in the courtyard, did Collins take steps to
    determine if they were trespassing?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes
    based on the “Burden of Proof”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 1 was “yes”, specify the steps taken by Collins to
    determine if the plaintiffs were trespassing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. According
    to Collins and Barnes’ testimony they did try to ask if they “live here” and testified
    that the response was “we don’t have to tell you anything”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.&nbsp;
    Was Gentles belligerent and/or vulgar in his answers to Collins’ questions?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.&nbsp; Did
    Gentles act in a physically intimidating manner towards Collins or Barnes prior
    to his arrest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.
    Collins COULD have interpreted Gentles’ actions as physically intimidating. <span
class=GramE>No to Barnes.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.&nbsp; Did
    Gentles advise Collins or Barnes that he would wait on the sidewalk after the
    call for back-up was made? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. No,
    based on “Burden of Proof”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.&nbsp;
    Did Gentles identify himself to Collins and Barnes as a resident of 200 <span
class=SpellE>Sherbourne</span> at any time prior to the arrest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.&nbsp;
    Prior to Collins arresting Gentles, did Collins advise Gentles and Francis that
    they would have to leave the property or be arrested for trespass if they did
    not live there?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8.&nbsp;
    Did Collins have an honest belief that Gentles was guilty of trespass prior to
    arresting him?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>9.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 8 was “yes”, then please state the basis for Collins’
    belief.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Collins
    may have been pre-occupied enough to “miss” the statement from Gentles stating
    that he “lived here”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 8 was “no”, then please provide particulars of your
    reasons for so finding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. N/A</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>11.&nbsp;
    Did Collins touch Gentles on the shoulder while advising him that he was under
    arrest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.&nbsp;
    Did Gentles punch or strike Collins prior to Collins jumping on Gentles?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.
    The “punch or strike” may not have been intentional but rather a reflex
    reaction of invasion of personal space.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>13.&nbsp;
    If the answer to question 12 was yes, did Collins act in self-defence in
    grappling with Gentles?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes
    with possible misinterpretation of Gentles’ reaction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>14.&nbsp;
    Was the arrest of Gentles a reasonable course of action in all of the
    circumstances?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. No</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 14 was “no”, then please provide particulars of your
    reasons for so finding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. We feel
    that Gentles did identify himself as a resident but some other circumstances
    justified this as a reasonable course of action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>16.&nbsp;
    Did Francis hit or strike Barnes or Collins or attempt to pull Collins off
    Gentles before Barnes advised Francis that he was under arrest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes. We
    feel that Francis attempted to pull Collins off of Gentles and in the process
    Barnes interpreted this as a hit or strike.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17.&nbsp;
    Did Barnes hold an honest belief that Francis was guilty of assault prior to
    arresting him?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>18.&nbsp;
    If your answer to question 17 was “yes”, on what was this belief based?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. See Q.
