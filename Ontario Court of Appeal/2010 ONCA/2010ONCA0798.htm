  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for the offence of
    having care and control of a motor vehicle while having more that 80 mg of
    alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  This was
    the appellant’s fourth drinking and driving conviction and he was sentenced to 16
    months in custody and a lifetime driving prohibition.  His appeal from that sentence was abandoned in
    oral argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary ground of appeal is that the trial judge
    erred by failing to put the appellant to his election as required by s. 536(2)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The secondary ground of appeal is that the
    trial judge erred in several respects, essentially by misapprehending the
    evidence or failing to provide adequate reasons for the conviction.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will briefly set out the essential facts relating to
    the appellant’s conviction here and below and will deal with the facts relating
    to the issue of the s. 536(2) election in my analysis of that issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of his arrest, the appellant, showing
    obvious signs of intoxication, was in the driver’s seat of his vehicle, parked
    at the side of a busy highway.  A
    tow-truck driver testified that a few minutes earlier, he had seen the
    appellant get out of the driver’s seat of the vehicle at another point along
    the highway.  The appellant testified and
    denied that he had been driving the vehicle.  He testified that his wife had been driving,
    that when observed by the tow-truck driver he had exited from the rear seat of
    the car on the driver’s <span class=GramE>side,</span> and that shortly before
    he was arrested he had got into the driver’s seat to check a problem with the
    car’s heating.  The appellant’s wife also
    testified that she had been driving the car on the night in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave some seven pages of oral reasons
    explaining why he accepted the Crown’s evidence, disbelieved the defence
    evidence, and found that on all the evidence, including the defence evidence,
    he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had care and
    control of the vehicle.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>1. Did the trial judge
    misapprehend the evidence or otherwise err in his reasons for conviction?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did not call upon the Crown to respond to the
    secondary ground of appeal.  In my view
    the trial judge provided adequate reasons to explain why he was convinced
    beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt, and I see no error of law
    or fact in those reasons that would justify intervention by this court.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:
normal'>2. Did the trial judge err in law by failing to put the appellant to
    his election pursuant to the Criminal Code, s. 536(2)?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the primary ground of appeal relating to
    the failure to put the appellant to his election as required by the <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 536(2):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If an
    accused is before a justice charged with an indictable offence, other than an
    offence listed in section 469, and the offence is not one over which a
    provincial court judge has absolute jurisdiction under section 553, the justice
    shall, after the information has been read to the accused, put the accused to
    an election in the following words:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>You have the
    option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and
    without having had a preliminary inquiry; or you may elect to be tried by a
    judge without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a
    judge and jury. If you do not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be
    tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you elect to be tried by a
    judge without a jury or by a court composed of a judge and jury or if you are
    deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, you
    will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How
    do you elect to be tried?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the record that the prescribed words
    of the formal election were never put to the appellant.  The issue is whether the appellant, through
    his counsel, waived the formal election.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To answer that question, it is necessary to set out in
    some detail the manner in which the case proceeded from initial appearance
    until trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 30, 2009 the matter was spoken to before a
    justice of the peace.  Mr. Nguyen, the
    appellant’s counsel at the time, attended to pick up the disclosure.  The appellant was charged with a dual
    procedure offence and his counsel asked the Crown to make its election as to
    mode of trial.  The Crown elected at that
    time to proceed by way of indictment and the presiding justice noted the Crown’s
    election on the information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Nguyen again appeared on April 24, 2009 and
    indicated that he was filing a counsel designation.  The Crown again indicated that it was
    proceeding by indictment and the matter was adjourned to review disclosure and for
    a pre-trial.  On May 22, 2009, Mr. Nguyen
    again appeared, this time to adjourn the matter for a “Crown resolution meeting”.
    The matter was again spoken to on June 19, 2009, when the appellant’s counsel
    indicated that he had had a pre-trial and asked for an adjournment to allow the
    appellant to consider whether to enter a guilty plea or set a trial date. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The matter was next spoken to </span><span lang=EN-US>on July 17, 2009, when the parties were before
    a justice of the peace to set a date for either a preliminary hearing or a
    trial in the provincial court.  The
    following exchange took place:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>TRIAL COORDINATOR:           This matter has been noted by
    indictment, Your Worship.  I need to know
    the defence position.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>MR. NGUYEN:                           Yes.  I’m appearing today by way of designation.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>THE COURT:                              Yes, and are you
    going to be electing a preliminary hearing or a trial?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a
name="OLE_LINK5"></a><a name="OLE_LINK4"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>MR. NGUYEN</span></a><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>:                           No, a trial.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>TRIAL COORDINATOR:           Estimate of time?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>MR. NGUYEN:                           Probably half a
    day.  I have been discussing with the Crown,
    probably half a day.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    some discussion as to the number of witnesses the parties intended to call, the
    presiding justice decided that a judicial pre-trial was required.  The matter was adjourned for that purpose to
    September 4, 2009.  On that day,
    presumably after the judicial pre-trial had been conducted, it was determined
    that a full day would be needed for the trial.  The matter was spoken to before a justice of
    the peace to set the trial date.  The justice
    of the peace asked “Have elections been made, Madam Clerk?” and the clerk
    responded “By indictment.”  Nothing was
    said as to the appellant’s election under s. 536(2).  The justice of the peace set the matter down
    for a one-day trial on June 2, 2010.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case came on for trial on the appointed day.  The appellant was now represented by a
    different counsel.  After some discussion
    about the arrangements that had been made for an interpreter, the appellant was
    arraigned and pleaded not guilty.  The
    trial commenced with no reference to an election pursuant to s. 536(2). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the failure to put him to
    his election as required by s.&nbsp;536(2) is fatal, as without the election
    the trial judge had no jurisdiction to try the appellant.  The respondent submits that the appellant
    waived the election.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point for analysis is the judgment of
    Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. Mitchell</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 643 (C.A.).  That
    case holds that allegations of procedural error can be analyzed in three parts:</p>
  <p>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was there a failure to comply with a statutory
    procedural requirement?</p>
  <p>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If there was a non-compliance, is it rendered harmless
    by s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>?</p>
  <p>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If there was non-compliance and s. 686(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv) cannot be applied, did the appellant waive
    compliance with the procedural requirement?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common ground that there was a failure to comply
    with the statutory procedural requirement.  Section 536(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> directs that “the justice shall” put the accused to his election in
    the words as set out in that <span class=GramE>subsection,</span> and the
    election was never put.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Mitchell</i> holds that as failure to comply with s. 536(2) goes to the jurisdiction of the
    trial court, and that as the curative proviso in s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv)
    only applies to errors committed by a court having “jurisdiction over the class
    of offence”, the proviso is not available to cure an error with respect to the
    accused’s s. 536(2) election.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This takes us to the third step of the <i>Mitchell</i> analysis and the issue of
    whether the provincial court had jurisdiction to try the appellant because he
    had waived compliance with the procedural requirement laid down by s. 536(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the language of s. 536(2) is mandatory, it is
    well-established that the requirement it lays down for a formal election as to
    mode of trial can be waived by the accused: <i>Mitchell</i>; <i>R. v. Pulles</i>, 2007 ONCA 519.  A leading case on waiver, cited in <i>Mitchell,</i> is <i>Korponay v. A.G. (Canada</i>), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41. <i>Korponay</i> dealt with the related issue of a re-election for a judge-alone
    trial after the accused had elected trial by judge and jury.  The accused, following local practice, informed
    a court clerk that he wished to re-elect and appeared on the trial date ready
    to proceed with a judge-alone trial.  The
    accused was not put to his re-election as required by s. 492(1). (<span
class=GramE>see</span> now s. 561(7).)  When
    asked for his plea, counsel for the accused said “judge alone”.  The trial proceeded and the accused was
    convicted.  He appealed his conviction, <i>inter alia</i>, on the ground that he had
    not been put to his re-election as required by s. 492(1).  Writing for the Court, Lamer J. stated at p. 49
    that the validity of a waiver depended upon it being  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>clear</span></i></span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> and
    unequivocal that the person is waiving the procedural safeguard and is doing so
    with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and of
    the effect the waiver will have on those rights in the process.</span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lamer J. held at p. 52 that what had occurred satisfied
    that requirement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The judge had before
    him an attorney whose knowledge of the law and of the practice of the criminal
    law does not appear to be in issue. He was, in my view, amply justified in
    assuming, since everyone was there to proceed with the trial, that the attorney
    had discussed the matter with Korponay and that Korponay made an informed
    decision, on the advice of his attorney, to proceed to trial, not before a
    jury, but before that judge sitting without a jury, and that the attorney was
    fully authorized to do anything necessary to that end. The judge was therefore
    in my view amply justified in considering that the attorney’s saying “judge
    alone” was an informed waiver of the requirement of putting to his client the
    words of the section. The accused’s attorney knew what those words <span
class=GramE>were,</span> he knew what they meant and what effect his answer “judge
    alone” would have on his client’s rights.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent submits that, as in <i>Mitchell</i> and <i>Korponay</i>, the appellant waived the procedural right accorded by s.
    536(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    respondent </span>places heavy reliance on the exchange that occurred on July
    17, 2009 when the appellant’s counsel appeared to set a date and, when asked by

    with the appellant that, standing <span class=GramE>on its own</span>, that
    exchange did not amount to a waiver of</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>the procedural requirement laid down
    by s. 536(2).  The appellant’s counsel
    was asked how he was <i>going</i> to elect,
    not how he <i>did </i>elect, and it is
    telling that the presiding justice did not endorse an election on the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What occurred on July 17, 2009 may be contrasted with

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>In <i>Mitchell</i></span>, Crown
    counsel explicitly asked that the accused be put to his election and, after
    defence counsel stated “[t]rial”, Crown counsel asked that the election be
    endorsed on the information. In the case at bar, the appellant, through his
    counsel, clearly indicated that it was his present intention to elect trial in
    the provincial court, but there was no mention made of putting the appellant “to
    his election today” and no request to formalize matters by having an election
    endorsed on the information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that on July 17, the appellant did not waive
    his election under s. 536(2).  What
    occurred on that day left it open to the appellant to change his mind later and
    to elect to have a preliminary inquiry and trial in the superior <span
class=GramE>court.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, this does not end the inquiry. While I
    certainly do not condone the lack of attention given to the requirements of s.
    536(2) in this case, I conclude that when the July 17 indication of the
    appellant’s then-present intention to elect trial in the provincial court is
    considered together with his subsequent appearances and actions, it can
    properly be concluded that the appellant waived a formal s. 536(2) election. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At no time after telling the court on July 17 of the
    appellant’s present intention to elect trial in the provincial court, whether
    during in-court appearances or, so far as the record discloses, during out-of-court
    pre-trial discussions, did the appellant or his counsel give any indication of
    a change as to the appellant’s choice of mode of trial.  On the contrary, every action taken by the
    appellant, through his counsel, was consistent with an election to proceed with
    a provincial court trial and inconsistent with any equivocation as to that
    choice.  The appellant’s counsel
    participated in a judicial pre-trial on September 4 and on that same day
    appeared in court to set a date for trial.  This was explicitly done on the basis that the
    matter was to be tried in the provincial court.  When the question of elections was raised by
    the presiding justice, the appellant’s counsel remained silent.  Nine months later, on the appointed trial
    date, the appellant appeared with a different counsel fully prepared for the
    trial.  There is no suggestion that the
    counsel who represented the appellant throughout these proceedings were
    incompetent or that they provided him with inadequate assistance. There is no
    suggestion that the appellant did not understand his right to elect a
    preliminary inquiry and trial in the superior court and no suggestion that he
    was in any way prejudiced by the failure to put the formal election to him as
    required by s. 536(2). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, when the words spoken by the appellant’s
    counsel on July 17 are considered together with what transpired thereafter, it was,
    to paraphrase <i>Korponay</i>, <span
style='letter-spacing:.1pt'>clear and unequivocal that the appellant was
    waiving the procedural safeguard contained in s.&nbsp;536(2) and that he did so
    with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and of
    the effect the waiver would have on those rights in the process.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It may well be the case that in earlier days, what
    transpired in this case would be regarded as a fatal procedural defect, but
    rather than “revert to the extreme technicality of the old procedure<span
class=GramE>”(</span><i>R. v. Côté</i>,
    [1978] 1 S.C.R. 8 at p. 13), it is more in keeping with the modern approach
    that emphasizes substance over form to hold that the appellant did waive the
    right to the s. 536(2) election. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I repeat and adopt the observation of Doherty J.A. in <i>Mitchell</i> at pp. 655-656:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Some
    who read this judgment may suggest that it condones sloppy practice and
    undermines important procedural safeguards. I do not intend to convey any such
    message. The provisions in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> should be followed. Deviations from those procedures put the end
    product of the proceeding in doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What occurred in this case was sloppy. It is certainly
    not in the best interests of the orderly administration of justice to run the
    risk of having convictions set aside because of procedural defects that can
    arise from failure to follow the dictates of jurisdiction-conferring
    requirements of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    Efficient scheduling of court time is undermined as it is open to an accused who
    has only expressed an intention to elect a trial in provincial court to elect
    another mode of trial at the very last minute. This case suggests that in the
    rush of current day-to-day practice, involving numerous pre-trial appearances
    and extensive pre-trial discussions and proceedings, adequate heed is not
    always paid to the mandatory language of s. 536(2).  If that is so, steps should be taken to
    ensure that at some appropriate point in the proceedings, the demands of s. 536(2)
    are satisfied in a manner that is consistent with both the efficient scheduling
    of court time and the observance of the right of the accused to be apprised of
    the right to elect the mode of trial.</p>
