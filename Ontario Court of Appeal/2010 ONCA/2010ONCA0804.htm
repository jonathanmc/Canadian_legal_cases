  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of second degree murder and
    sentenced to life imprisonment with a parole ineligibility period of 15 years.  He raises two grounds of appeal against
    conviction and seeks leave to appeal the 15 year parole ineligibility period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim was fatally shot in a park following a
    dispute over a cigarette and a small quantity of marijuana.  The appellant asked the victim for a
    cigarette.  The victim refused and the
    appellant took some marijuana from a park table at which the victim was seated.
     The victim demanded the return of the
    marijuana.  A physical fight ensued
    during which the appellant took a gun from his waistband. At this point, a
    different version of events was put forth by both the Crown and the accused at
    trial.  The Crown’s theory, supported by
    the evidence of three of the victim’s friends, was that the appellant’s
    associate said “shoot him” and the appellant pointed the gun at the victim and
    fired it with the intent to kill him.  The defence position was that the appellant
    brandished his gun in self-<span class=GramE>defence, that</span> the victim
    had grabbed the gun and that during the struggle, the appellant stumbled and
    the gun went off accidentally. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown led a significant body of post-offence
    conduct evidence as to the appellant’s activities following the shooting,
    including disposing of the gun and items of clothing, shaving his head to
    conceal his identity, and sleeping in stairwells to avoid detection.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conviction
    appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><b><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>(1) Cross-examination of the
    appellant</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred
    in failing to instruct the jury that they could not rely on the Crown’s
    unproven suggestions in cross-examination that the accused’s father had given a
    statement to police that contradicted the appellant’s evidence.  The questions did not relate to the events at
    the park but rather to whether the appellant telephoned his father and whether
    his father drove him out of the city after the incident in the park. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that the Crown was not entitled to put the
    fact of the father’s statement to the accused in cross-examination without
    calling the father (or otherwise proving the statement) and that the exchange
    may have coloured the quite proper questions that followed.  However, we do not accept that it had the
    effect of adversely affecting the appearance of the fairness of the trial in
    the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the cross-examination and
    the Crown’s failure to call the father and, upon being advised that the Crown
    was going to “leave it alone”, determined that she would not give a specific
    instruction.  She noted that it would “draw
    it to the jury’s attention unnecessarily”.  The trial judge understood that the
    appellant’s credibility was <span class=GramE>key</span> to the defence.  She was in the best position to determine
    whether a specific instruction was necessary or appropriate and she exercised
    her discretion not to do so.  Furthermore,
    while the defence objected initially to the Crown’s line of questioning and
    re-iterated its concerns on two further occasions (to bolster its request for
    an instruction that is not the subject of this appeal), the defence did not
    consider it necessary to ask for a correcting instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, we are satisfied that the trial
    judge did not err in failing to give a correcting instruction. Accordingly, we would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><b><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>(2) Post-offence conduct</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in her
    instructions to the jury relating to post-offence conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge refused the defence’s request for a “no
    probative value” instruction.  No issue
    is taken with that ruling on this appeal.  However, the appellant submits that while the
    appellant’s post-offence conduct could be considered when deciding whether the
    homicide was culpable or non-culpable by reason of self-defence, the jury
    should have been instructed that if it rejected self-defence, the post-offence
    conduct evidence could not be used to determine whether the appellant should be
    convicted of manslaughter or murder.  Particular
    issue is taken with the following sentence from the jury instructions: “You
    should look at Palmer’s words and conduct before, at the time <i>and after</i> the unlawful act that caused
    Molina’s death” when deciding whether the appellant had intended to kill the
    victim. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this passage cannot be read in isolation.  Earlier in the charge, when she addressed the
    issue of post-offence conduct more fully, the trial judge did instruct the jury
    that there could be alternative explanations for the accused’s post-offence
    conduct unconnected with culpable homicide. She reminded the jury that the
    appellant had testified that he did the things he had done following the
    shooting because he knew the police were looking for him and he was afraid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficult issue of the treatment of post-offence
    conduct in cases where such evidence is relevant to one issue and not relevant
    to another arises with some frequency. It has been held that there is <span
lang=EN>“no prefabricated rule [that] stamps
    certain kinds of after-the-fact conduct as always or never relevant to a
    particular fact in issue” </span>and that in many cases, a nuanced instruction
    along the lines sought here may introduce a level of complexity that a trial
    judge may wish to avoid: <span lang=EN>see <i>R.
    v. Cudjoe </i>(2009), 251 O.A.C. 163 (C.A.), at paras. </span>78-79, 90. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, we agree that the trial judge should not
    have told the jury that they could look at the appellant’s conduct <i>after</i> the shooting when considering
    whether he should be convicted of murder or manslaughter.  It also would have been preferable had she specifically
    instructed the jury that the post-offence conduct evidence could have a bearing
    on:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the Crown had proved that
    the appellant had committed a culpable homicide and did not act in
    self-defence; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>     <span class=GramE>but</span> that it had
    no probative value as to: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    appellant’s consciousness of having committed second degree murder, as opposed
    to manslaughter.</span></p>
  <p class=headingnumber1 style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>See <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Peavoy</span> </i>(1997),
    34 O.R. (3d) 620 (C.A.) at pp. 631-32; <i>R.
    v. <span class=SpellE>Stiers</span></i> </span>2010 ONCA 382 at <span lang=EN>paras. <span class=GramE>59-61.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, we are not persuaded that any error that did
    occur was the cause of any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice within
    the meaning of s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The Crown presented an overwhelming case
    against the appellant.  Three witnesses testified
    that the shooting was deliberate and in the face of that evidence and in the
    light of all the circumstances of the shooting, the appellant’s evidence of
    self-defence or accident was not credible.  The theory of an accidental shooting that
    could lead to a manslaughter verdict was closely bound up and barely
    distinguishable from the theory of self-defence that the jury plainly rejected.
     In the end, we are persuaded that even
    if the trial judge had given the jury instruction now sought with respect to
    post-offence conduct, the jury’s verdict would have been the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.  Therefore, the appeal from
    conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Sentence
    Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the trial judge’s careful reasons for
    imposing a 15 year period of parole ineligibility.  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is
    granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
