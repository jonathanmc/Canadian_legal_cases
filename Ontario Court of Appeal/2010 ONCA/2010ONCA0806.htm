  <p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant was convicted of three counts of
    fraud-related offences and eight counts of sexual assault-related offences.  He was sentenced to fifteen years
    imprisonment less 44.5 months credit for pre-trial custody.  He appeals from conviction and seeks leave to
    appeal from sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant’s main ground on the conviction appeal
    relates to the failure of the trial judge to sever the sexual assault-related
    counts.  He argues that because of the reprehensible
    nature of those offences, the trial judge was required to sever and try those counts
    separately from the counts of fraud.  The
    trial judge’s failure to sever the counts, the appellant argues, prejudiced the
    jury and deprived him of a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For the reasons that follow, we do not accept this submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In <i>R. v. Last</i>,
    [2009] 3 S.C.R. 146, the Supreme Court of Canada recently considered the issue
    of severance.  While the decision in <i>Last </i>was delivered after the severance
    application in this matter was decided, in our view, the ruling fully complies
    with its dictates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In <i>Last</i> at
    para. 16, Deschamps J., writing for the Court, stated that the ultimate
    question faced by a trial judge in deciding whether to grant a severance
    application is whether severance is required in the interests of justice.  At para. 17, she states that this involves
    the weighing of factors to ensure that “a reasonable balance is struck between
    the risk of prejudice to the accused and the public interest in a single
    trial”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> A number of factors that the courts can properly
    consider are set out in para. 18 of <i>Last</i>.  They include: the general prejudice to the
    accused; the legal and factual nexus between the counts; the complexity of the
    evidence; the desire to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings; and, the use of similar
    fact evidence at trial.  In the present
    case, the trial judge properly considered each of these factors.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The trial judge was explicitly aware of the potential
    prejudice to the appellant in trying the two sets of counts together.  He recognized that the appalling nature of
    the evidence of the sexual assaults “might lead a jury to focus on unsavoury
    conduct and in so many words throw in the towel on the [appellant] for the fraud
    related charges.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> However, the trial judge ultimately concluded that the
    probative value of hearing the fraud and sexual assault charges together
    outweighed any potential prejudice to the appellant.  He committed no error in reaching this
    conclusion, given the substantial legal and factual nexus between the two sets
    of charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant would issue forms of threat indicating
    that he was associated with powerful people who could make people disappear or
    be hurt.  He introduced V.C. as his
    personal bodyguard to Merson.  He had
    previously beaten V.C. and showed her in an injured state to Merson to help
    prove his story that he was fending off a powerful secret society.  The appellant used similar methods in
    committing the other frauds and in his relationship with V.C. so that she would
    not leave him and report his assaults on her.  Further, some cheques obtained through the frauds were sent to V.C.’s
    residence and she filled them in, at the appellant’s direction.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The trial judge found that the information V.C. would
    give with respect to her involvement with the appellant on the fraud charges
    was direct evidence that would be properly presented to the jury.  In addition, he found that the evidence of
    the victims of the fraud would have a direct “interplay” with the sexual
    assault charges because the victims saw V.C. with the appellant and understood
    her to be a bodyguard with the organizations he claimed to be involved
    with.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The evidence relating to the two sets of charges was
    inextricably intertwined and, as the trial judge stated, there was no
    reasonable way to “sensitize” the evidence of the complainant V.C. and Merson
    without making their evidence useless.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We see no error in the fact that the trial judge admitted
    similar fact evidence regarding the controlling acts of the appellant.  Such evidence was admitted to explain the
    appellant’s modus operandi.  For example,
    he told Merson that he belonged to a powerful organization and V.C. that he
    belonged to a powerful family; he told both that he served in the military and
    that he had killed people; and he threatened death as a consequence for failing
    to do what he asked.  Crown counsel at
    trial identified 16 points of similarity between the acts committed against
    Merson and V.C.  We would simply add that
    there is no challenge to the trial judge’s instruction on similar fact evidence
    and that defence counsel never objected to the admissibility of such evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The trial judge properly balanced the prejudicial and
    probative factors in deciding whether to sever the charges.  He recognized that severance could impair not
    only the efficiency but also the truth-seeking function of the trial.  He acted judiciously in exercising his
    discretion to try the two sets of charges together and his decision is entitled
    to deference from this court: <i>Last</i>,
    at para. 14.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In relation to the sentence appeal, we see no basis on
    which to interfere with the global sentence of 15 years before credit for
    pre-trial custody.  The trial judge considered
    the appellant’s mitigating circumstances, including his short criminal record
    and his illness.  The trial judge properly
    held that the cruelty and torture of the offences against V.C. called for very
    strong denunciation by the court.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the
    sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
