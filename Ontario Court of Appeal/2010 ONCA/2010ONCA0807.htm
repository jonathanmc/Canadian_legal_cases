  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals against his conviction by a court
    composed of Howden J. and a jury on a charge of manslaughter.  The Crown alleged that the appellant
    unlawfully shot and killed his friend while the two of them were examining a
    handgun.  The Crown’s case turned almost
    entirely on expert evidence as to the manner in which the firearm was
    discharged.  The principal submission is
    that the verdict, necessarily based on this expert evidence, is
    unreasonable.  While the appellant raises
    other grounds of appeal, I agree that the verdict is unreasonable.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set
    aside the conviction and enter an acquittal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Shooting</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the deceased Tuan Dang were
    friends.  There was no evidence of any
    animosity between them.  On June 5, 2006,
    the appellant and his girlfriend were visiting Mr. Dang and Yvonne Chung, the
    mother of Mr. Dang’s child.  At some
    point, the appellant and the deceased went upstairs to one of the bedrooms.  A short time later, the women heard a loud
    noise.  Ms. Chung ran upstairs to find
    the appellant helping the deceased out of the bedroom.  When the deceased fell down, the appellant
    picked him up and carried him downstairs to his car.  The appellant’s girlfriend drove the appellant,
    the deceased and Ms. Chung to the hospital.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Chung testified that on the way to the hospital the
    appellant said that they were looking at the gun and it accidentally went
    off.  The appellant made a circular
    motion with his finger, suggesting that someone had been twirling the gun
    around his finger like a cowboy.  The
    appellant made these comments in Vietnamese.  Ms. Chung did not speak Vietnamese fluently and she had some difficulty
    understanding the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hospital, the staff attempted to save the
    deceased.  In the course of those
    measures the deceased’s shirt was pulled and torn open.  The shirt was then placed in a plastic bag
    and thrown in the corner of the treatment room.  Sometime later the police retrieved the shirt, which at that point had
    been placed in a paper bag. The handling of the shirt became important for
    understanding the expert evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Police Investigation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police did not come to the deceased’s home until
    two days after the shooting.  In the
    bedroom, they found the handgun on top of a dresser near the door.  They also found a vest of body armour on the
    bed.  It seems to have been common ground
    that both the gun and the body armour belonged to the deceased.  There were no fingerprints recovered from the
    gun.  There is no evidence that the
    appellant returned to the deceased’s home before the police attended. A number
    of people, in addition to the deceased, lived at the residence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Expert Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Toby Rose performed the autopsy on the
    deceased.  The deceased died from a
    gunshot wound to the chest.  Dr. Rose
    initially concluded that the bullet wound was a “contact wound” meaning that
    the muzzle of the gun had been against the deceased’s body when it was
    discharged.  She based her opinion on a
    ring of black soot surrounding the wound and pink discolouration of the skin which
    she attributed as being caused by carbon monoxide emitted by the gun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Dr. Rose changed her opinion after meeting
    with Annalisa Lacalamita, the firearms examiner, and Ms. Lacalamita’s
    superior.  It was Ms. Lacalamita’s
    opinion that the gun had been held at a distance of at least 1.4 metres when it
    was discharged.  As a result, Dr. Rose
    changed her opinion and decided that the black ring was a “drying artefact”,
    and not evidence of a contact wound.  She
    could no longer explain the pink ring, since carbon monoxide could not be the
    cause of the pink ring if it was not a contact wound.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, as it turned out, Dr. Rose’s new opinion did
    not bear up under scrutiny.  In
    cross-examination, she conceded that the drying artefact opinion was very
    unusual and that she had never seen it before in similar circumstances.  She was unable to point to any literature to
    support this phenomenon.  She was also
    unable to offer an opinion as to how long the drying process would take.  Finally, she could not explain a photograph taken
    less than two hours after the time of death that showed the black ring when the
    wound was still clearly damp with blood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Lacalamita</span> testified that
    the gun, a revolver, had no tendency to discharge accidentally.  However, if the gun were cocked, relatively
    little force, 1.9 kilograms of pressure, was required to fire the gun.  If the gun were not cocked, about 5 kilograms
    of pressure were required.  The gun
    itself was relatively light, weighing only 0.68 kilograms when loaded.  Ms. Lacalamita testified that it was
    “possible” for the gun to discharge accidentally if someone were twirling it
    around their finger while it was in a cocked position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Lacalamita’s opinion concerning the distance from
    which the firearm was discharged turned on the conclusions she drew from the
    state of the deceased’s shirt.  She
    explained that she looked for gunshot residues on the shirt.  There are various types of residues.  There is soot, which <span class=GramE>is</span> partially burnt and unburnt gunpowder and a smoke cloud.  The closer the target surface is to the gun,
    the greater the concentration of soot.  The
    presence of soot is determined by a visual inspection.  Another gunshot residue is vaporous lead.  The presence of vaporous lead is determined
    using a chemical test.  Ms.&nbsp;<span
class=SpellE>Lacalamita</span> also referred to firmly held and loosely held
    particles of residue.  The presence of
    these particles is also determined by a visual inspection.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In examination-in-chief, Ms. Lacalamita testified that
    she found no firearm discharge residues around the apparent entrance hole.  She then performed some tests with the
    revolver by firing it from various distances at cloth-covered surfaces.  She found that at 1.4 metres (4.5 feet) there
    were loosely held particles on the cloth that could be shaken off.  There were no particles when the revolver was
    discharged at the slightly further distance of 5 feet.  Since she found no gunshot residues on the
    shirt, she concluded that the firearm had to have been discharged from a
    distance of more than 4.5 feet or 1.4 metres. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Lacalamita</span> did not do any testing at less than 3.5 feet. She testified that based on the
    literature and not her own testing she believed that there would be soot and
    other firmly held particles when the gun was fired from up to 12 inches away.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In examination-in-chief, Ms. Lacalamita was asked about
    the effect of the handling of the shirt in the treatment room: that it had been
    torn off, placed in a plastic bag and thrown on the floor, before being placed
    in a paper bag and given to police.  She
    testified that it was difficult to say what would happen but she would expect
    loosely held particles could fall off, especially from the static electricity inside
    the plastic bag.  She could not say how
    much of the loosely held particles would be lost.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, Ms. Lacalamita conceded that
    there were some problems with the manner in which she conducted the
    testing.  She used cotton to cover the
    target, although she did not know the composition of the shirt.  The result could also be affected by the fact
    that the test panels were hit square on; if the deceased were hit at an angle,
    the particles may not have lodged on the fabric in the same way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, her conclusion about the distance of the
    firing from the shirt was based on the assumption that the shirt had never had
    any loosely-held particles on it.  However, this assumption did not account for the rough handling of the
    shirt while the deceased was wearing it on the way to the hospital and after it
    was removed, which could easily have dislodged loosely held particles, and
    possibly embedded particles.  She did not
    believe that the rough handling could remove soot. She testified that
    “guidelines” for firearms examiners state that soot will be present at
    distances up to 8 inches and possibly 12 inches.  Finally, Ms. Lacalamita did not receive the
    plastic bag in which the shirt had originally been placed and so she was unable
    to determine if any particles had been lost in the bag due to static
    electricity.  By the end of Ms. Lacalamita’s
    testimony, she had conceded that the handling of the shirt could change her
    opinion that the gun was at least 1.4 metres from the shirt when it was
    discharged.  She maintained in re-examination,
    however, that the revolver must have been at least 12 inches from the shirt due
    to the absence of soot and embedded particles, which she opined would not have
    been dislodged by the rough handling.  However,
    she then seemed to agree that even embedded particles could be removed by rough
    handling:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In terms of embedded powder particles, again, it
    depends on the – how severe the handling is and what’s happened to it, so I can
    only say it would be possible, but I don’t know it if – if it actually would
    happen in the scenario described.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When she met with Dr. Rose, Ms. Lacalamita only told
    her that her tests showed that the distance was “going to be greater than four
    and a half feet”.  She did not tell Dr.
    Rose about the problem with the plastic bag because she was unaware of it at
    the time of the meeting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Bradley Joice is an expert in shooting
    reconstruction and bullet trajectory analysis.  In his opinion, based on the position of the bullet holes in the walls
    of the house and the entrance and exit wounds on the deceased, the deceased was
    crouching down or bending over somewhat at the time he was shot.  His opinion, however, was based on the theory
    that the bullet travelled in a straight line from the gun, through the body of
    the deceased and into the walls.  He had
    no particular expertise to say whether the bullet would have changed direction
    as it travelled through these various media.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Theory of the Crown</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The theory of Crown counsel at trial (not Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Klukach</span>) was that the appellant had shot the deceased.  He submitted that Ms. Lacalamita’s evidence
    still established that the gun was more than 12 inches from the shirt and that
    it had no tendency to discharge accidentally.  Further, the evidence of Detective Joice established that the deceased
    would have had to have been holding the gun at an awkward angle at the moment
    it discharged.  He also relied upon the
    place where the gun had been found, pointing out that it was unlikely the
    deceased could have placed it on the dresser given how he was being helped out
    of the room by the appellant, as observed by Ms. Chung.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Trial Judge’s Charge on the Opinions of Dr. Rose and
    Ms. Lacalamita</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge summarized the expert evidence at some
    length.  In particular, he dealt with the
    erosion of the opinions of Dr. Rose and Ms. Lacalamita.  Some of those instructions are of assistance
    in understanding the expert evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The
    conclusion of Ms. Lacalamita that the shot had to have been at a minimum
    distance of 4.5 feet or 1.4 metres from Tuan Dang has not survived this trial</i>.
    That conclusion rested on there being no gunpowder particles projected onto the
    deceased’s shirt by the shot on June 5.  Assuming
    that the shirt contained no gunpowder particles, Ms. Lacalamita believed she
    could simply test fire the gun at lengthening distances until gunpowder
    particles no longer appeared on the target surface, being not a loosely worn
    shirt but tighter woven cloth placed against a wood and foam frame. The problem
    with that assumption was that the shirt was not tested for gunpowder residue
    immediately after the event, nor was it contained in a protected environment
    from the time of the shot.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>It is the
    opinions of Ms. Lacalamita and Doctor Rose, though given the latter’s
    willingness to agree with Lacalamita without providing a scientific basis for
    it, ultimately it is on Ms. Lacalamita’s evidence of the shot being at least 12
    inches from the target based on lack of soot on the shirt that the Crown now
    rests its case, together with the trajectory analysis of Detective Joice. There
    is no longer any basis for the conclusion of Ms. Lacalamita, now that she has
    factored in the handling of the shirt and the potential for loss of gunpowder
    particles after the shooting, that the minimum distance of the shot on June 5
    was 4.5 feet</i>. As well, nothing she has said takes away from Doctor Rose’s
    physical observations of the wound which initially led her to the conclusion
    that it showed characteristics of a loose contact wound.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Please remember that
    you may not speculate beyond where the evidence takes you. You may draw
    reasonable inferences but they must be based on evidence. You should ask
    yourself in this case, each one of you and together, after considering all the
    evidence, and especially in view of the changes in position of the expert
    witnesses who were the only base for determining originally that the shot could
    not have come from Tuan Dang, and <i>now
    that that distance is down from 4.5 feet to 8 to 12 inches, with evidence of a
    small black soot-like rim around the entry wound, can you really say beyond any
    reasonable doubt what happened in that room, and specifically, which activated
    the trigger and how.</i> You must ponder that and all of what the counsel and I
    have said very carefully, but in the end, words like “unlikely” and “probably”
    cannot satisfy the Crown’s burden on the ultimate issues, who shot the gun and
    was it done unlawfully. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Jury’s Question</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some four hours into their deliberation, the jury asked
    this question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this morning’s charge, the judge stated
    Ms.&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Lacalamita’s</span> distance determination did not
    survive the court.  Also, distance of
    shot is now down to eight to 12 inches firing range.  Question:  Are we restricted to this distance as fact?</p>
  <p>After consulting with counsel, the trial judge answered
    the question as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’ve had a chance to
    hear from counsel, and what I suggest to you is this.  First of all, this is a factual
    question.  You are the judges of the
    facts so the answer to the question, “Are we restricted to this distance as
    fact”, is, no.  You should evaluate Ms.
    Lacalamita’s evidence and decide what weight or reliance you place on it,
    that’s for you.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have indicated, the principal ground of appeal is
    that the verdict is unreasonable.  The
    appellant further submits that the trial judge’s answer to the jury’s question
    was misleading; that the trial judge erred in leaving pointing a firearm as a
    basis for unlawful act manslaughter; and that the trial judge misdirected the
    jury on careless use of a firearm, which was the other unlawful act upon which
    the Crown relied for manslaughter.  Given
    my conclusion that the verdict is unreasonable I do not intend to deal with
    those grounds of appeal.  I will,
    however, refer to the jury question issue as it sheds light on the reasonableness
    of the verdict.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for whether a jury verdict is reasonable is
    well established:  whether the verdict is
    one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have
    rendered:  See <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at p. 185 and<i> R. v. <span class=SpellE>Biniaris</span></i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 at
    para. 36.  The reasons of Arbour J. in <i>Biniaris</i> are extremely helpful in
    understanding how that test is to be applied by an appellate court.  First, it is not enough that the appeal court
    has some vague unease or lurking doubt about the verdict.  The court must still articulate the basis
    upon which it finds the jury’s verdict to be unreasonable.  The basis for the finding of unreasonableness
    may be grounded in judicial experience.  As Arbour J. said at para. 40, the concept of acting judicially means “arriving
    at a conclusion that does not conflict with the bulk of judicial experience”.  She continued on this theme at para. 41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not particularly significant to describe this
    judicial oversight as either objective or subjective. It is exercised by an
    appeal court and <i>therefore it will
    invariably draw on a collection of judicial experiences</i>. Because of its
    judicial character, and because it purports to identify features of a case that
    will give experienced jurists cause for concern, <i>it is imperative that the reviewing court articulate as precisely as
    possible what features of the case suggest that the verdict reached by the jury
    was unreasonable</i>, despite the fact that it was not tainted by any erroneous
    instructions as to the applicable law. …  There are many illustrations
    from the case law of verdicts having been found unreasonable <i>essentially on the strength of accumulated
    judicial experience</i>. Concerns about various aspects of the frailty of
    identification evidence have been a recurrent basis, by itself or together with
    other considerations, for overturning verdicts as unreasonable. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the explanation for the flawed verdict in
    this case must lie in the jury’s understanding of the expert evidence.  Judicial experience, informed by cases such
    as <i>R. v. Mohan,</i> [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 and<i> R. v. Truscott</i> (2007), 225 C.C.C. (3d)
    321, and the recent report of Justice Goudge of this court stemming from the <i>Inquiry into Pediatric Forensic Pathology in
    Ontario</i> demonstrate the dangers inherent in failing to adequately and
    critically examine expert evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Truscott</i>,
    at para. 169, this court referred to the shift in forensic medicine from the
    authoritative experience model to an evidence-based approach as described by
    Dr. Pollanen, the Chief Forensic Pathologist for Ontario:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In his report and in his testimony before us, Dr.
    Pollanen described a shift in approach in forensic medicine and in other
    branches of medicine more generally. <i>Traditionally,
    expert opinions were largely based on authoritative experience and anecdotal
    case reports</i>. In the past few decades, and particularly in the last ten
    years, <i>an alternative model has developed
    called the &quot;evidence-based approach&quot;.</i> <i>This approach requires a critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature
    and attention to primary reviewable evidence from the postmortem examination</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elements of the opinions of Dr. Rose and Ms. Lacalamita
    have about them the resort to authoritative experience and, in key features,
    lack grounding in the evidence.  Most
    obviously, Dr. Rose changed her opinion that the bullet wound was a contact
    wound, but was unable to support that change in opinion either through the
    evidence or any peer-reviewed literature.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Lacalamita’s original opinion that the revolver was
    more than 1.4 metres from the shirt was undermined by her failure to consider
    the frailties in the evidence, most importantly, her failure to consider the
    impact of the rough handling of the shirt and its original storage in the
    plastic bag.  There were other frailties
    in her opinion, including her use of cotton to conduct her tests, her failure
    to consider the angle at which the gun was discharged, and her failure to
    conduct tests at less than 3.5 feet.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To her credit, Ms. Lacalamita did modify her opinion to
    take into account the problems that were drawn to her attention.  The concern is that the full impact of the
    frailties of the opinion may have been lost on the jury.  I say that, in part, because of the jury’s
    question set out above.  In hindsight, that
    question suggests that the jury did not fully appreciate the extent to which
    Ms. Lacalamita’s opinion had been undermined and was prepared to embark on
    speculation as to the distance the firearm was from the shirt. The question
    suggests that the jury was prepared to overlook the frailties in Ms.
    Lacalamita’s opinion so clearly elucidated by the trial judge in the main
    charge. In other words, the jury did not understand the importance of the
    evidence-based approach as a foundation for the reliability of expert opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mohan</i>, at
    p. 21, <span class=SpellE>Sopinka</span> J. spoke of the dangers of expert
    evidence: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is a danger that expert evidence will be
    misused and will distort the fact-finding process. Dressed up in scientific
    language which the jury does not easily understand and submitted through a
    witness of impressive antecedents, this evidence is apt to be accepted by the
    jury as being virtually infallible and as having more weight than it deserves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury’s verdict suggests that it did not subject the
    expert evidence, especially the evidence of Ms. Lacalamita and Detective Joice,
    to the critical analysis required with a full appreciation of the reservations
    inherent in their opinions.  The result
    may have been to distort the fact-finding process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s theory that the appellant shot the deceased
    appeared unassailable at the opening of the trial.  Dr. Rose had resiled from her opinion that
    the wound was a contact wound, Ms. Lacalamita had put the distance from which
    the firearm was discharged at over 1.4 metres, well beyond the reach of the
    deceased, and Detective Joice had testified to a trajectory that seemed an
    unlikely basis for a self-inflicted injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the end of the case, properly understood, the expert
    evidence had undermined the Crown’s case to such an extent that it could no
    longer confidently be said that the wound was not self-inflicted.  Aside from the obvious opinion that death was
    the result of a gunshot, Dr. Rose’s opinion that the wound was not a contact
    wound had been entirely discredited.  Ms. <span class=SpellE>Lacalamita’s</span> opinion that the gun was more than 1.4
    metres from the deceased had reduced to more than 12 inches, well within the
    range of a self-inflicted injury.  In
    fact, given her uncertainty about the possibility that even embedded particles
    had been removed by the rough handling before Ms. Lacalamita received the
    shirt, it may well be that the distance had been reduced to 8 to 12
    inches.  Detective Joice’s opinion about
    the trajectory was subject to assumptions that were not verified by the
    evidence. Further, the inference that the gun would have had to have been held
    at an awkward angle is no more than speculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remaining non-expert evidence did not point to the
    appellant as the person holding the gun at the fateful moment.  The fact that the gun was found on the
    dresser two days later did not yield any relevant inference.  The appellant may have placed the gun there
    after shooting the deceased, but the house held many other individuals and the
    Crown did not exclude the reasonable possibility that any of them placed the
    gun where it was found.  Even if the
    appellant did place the gun on the dresser, this fact is not inconsistent with the
    deceased being the shooter and the appellant having picked up the gun after it
    fell from the deceased’s hand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, counsel for the respondent sought to
    support the reasonableness of the verdict by reference to the fact that the
    appellant did not testify.  In <i>R. v. Noble</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874 at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 103, <span class=SpellE>Sopinka</span> J. speaking
    for the majority explained the limited use to which failure to testify can be
    put on review of the reasonableness of a jury verdict:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the appellate review cases do not
    contradict the conclusion that silence may not be placed on the evidentiary
    scales, either by the trier of fact or by appellate courts. Rather, the cases
    hold that appellate courts, like triers of fact, may refer to the silence of
    the accused as indicative of the absence of an exculpatory explanation; silence
    is not inculpatory, but nor is it exculpatory. Nowhere do the appellate review
    cases outlined above explicitly state that silence may be used as a
    &quot;make-weight&quot; by the trier of fact, but there is wording that
    suggests that silence may be used simply in the limited sense of not providing
    an innocent explanation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, silence cannot be used to strengthen a weak Crown
    case and that is the case here.  Given
    the frailties in the expert evidence and the lack of other evidence of any kind
    to support a conviction, the fact that the appellant did not testify is of no
    value.  This was not a case where the
    defence depended upon exculpatory explanations.  In its simplest form, this case was about the inferences to be drawn
    from the expert evidence and the fact that the appellant and the deceased were
    alone at the time the gun discharged.  There were two possibilities arising from the evidence: either the appellant
    was holding the gun at the fatal moment or the deceased was holding the
    gun.  The Crown’s case, based on Ms.&nbsp;Lacalamita’s
    original opinion, was that the injury could not have been self-inflicted.  By the end of the trial, the Crown could no
    longer eliminate the equally likely possibility that the deceased was indeed
    holding the gun when it discharged. Given the state of the evidence, it was not
    possible to know what happened and how this tragic death occurred. The verdict
    was unreasonable and the conviction must be set aside.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside
    the conviction for manslaughter and enter an acquittal.</p>
