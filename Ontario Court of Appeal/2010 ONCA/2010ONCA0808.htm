    had been involved in a relationship for about three years before the
    homicide.  On the Crown’s theory, Trish
    decided to end that relationship and told the appellant so.  The Crown contended that the appellant, an
    obsessively jealous person who had threatened the deceased and had been
    physically violent towards her in the past, would not accept that the
    relationship was over.  On the Crown’s
    theory, anger and jealousy led the appellant to murder the deceased.  There was evidence to support the Crown’s
    contention that the relationship between Trish and the appellant was volatile and
    that the appellant was very jealous and did not want the relationship to end.  </span></p>

    shortly after 2:00 p.m. on July 7, 2001.  There was evidence in the form of a statement made by Trish to a friend
    during a telephone call that she was still with the appellant about a half an
    hour later at 2:34 p.m.  The
    admissibility of the statement is a ground of appeal.  Trish’s body was found in the Little
    Etobicoke Creek at about 7:05 p.m. the next day (July 8).  She had been manually strangled and forcibly
    drowned.  Trish had not been seen since
    the previous day and had missed a scheduled hair appointment at 6:00 p.m. on
    July 7.  Her cell phone had become
    inoperative at 3:41 p.m. on July 7.  On
    the Crown’s theory, she was murdered at about that time.  </p>

    events.  There was considerable evidence
    as to the circumstances surrounding both the alleged statements by the
    appellant and the police interviews of his father and brothers.  The defence contended that the family members
    had been coerced and threatened by the authorities into giving statements that
    inculpated the appellant.<span style='line-height:

    confessed when Gurvinder went to India to meet with the appellant.  Gurvinder had given three statements to the
    police.  In the first two, he indicated
    that his brother had told him that he did not know anything about the
    homicide.  Gurvinder’s third statement,
    given under oath and videotaped and made after Gurvinder had been told that
    charges against him would be dropped if he told the truth, was consistent with

    after the murder.  He told the police
    that his brother had been with him all afternoon.  Ranjit gave a second statement in August 2002
    indicating that his brother had confessed that he murdered Trish.  Ranjit testified at the preliminary inquiry
    eight months later.  In his testimony, he
    described how the appellant had returned to the apartment with wet pants and
    shoes and had proceeded to destroy the deceased’s cell phone.  Ranjit testified that his brother confessed

    together all afternoon on July 7, 2001 at the apartment.  He explained that he had told the police that
    his brother confessed and testified to that effect at the preliminary inquiry
    because he had been threatened and assaulted by the police and the Crown.  The police had threatened him before he gave
    his August 2002 statement, and both the police and the Crown had threatened and
    assaulted him immediately before he testified at the preliminary inquiry
    indicating that he would go to jail if his testimony differed from his August

  <h2><u>Issue 1:  The Admissibility of the
    Telephone Conversation</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown sought to lead evidence from Dorota Bielawski
    that she spoke to her friend Trish at 2:34 p.m. on July 7, 2001.  According to Ms. Bielawski, she and Trish
    were very good friends and spoke on the telephone quite often.  She called Trish to see if she wanted to go
    to the mall that afternoon.  Trish told
    her that she could not go to the mall as she was with the appellant.  Trish also mentioned that she had a hair
    appointment later that afternoon.  The
    conversation lasted about five minutes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown tendered this evidence not only to
    show that Ms. Bielawski spoke to Trish at 2:34 p.m. on July 7, meaning Trish
    was still alive at that time, but also as evidence that the appellant was with
    Trish at that time.  This latter use was
    clearly a hearsay use of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The admissibility of Trish’s statement that she
    was with the appellant was considered in a pre-trial <i>voir dire</i> during which the admissibility of a number of pieces of
    evidence was considered by the trial judge.  The trial judge, applying the principled approach to the admission of hearsay
    evidence as described in <i>R. v. Starr</i>,
    [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, held that the evidence was admissible as evidence that the
    appellant was with Trish when she spoke to her friend at 2:34 p.m.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant makes two submissions
    in support of the contention that the trial judge erred in admitting the
    evidence as evidence that the appellant was with Trish at 2:34 p.m.  First, he argues that the hearsay statement
    should have been excluded because on the entirety of the <i>voir dire</i> record there was “a possibility that the deceased had
    reason to fabricate the statement or was at least capable of deceiving Bielawski”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel also submits that even if the trial
    judge’s ruling was correct on the law as it stood at the time of the ruling,
    the decision in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>,
    [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, decided after the trial, has changed the law and compels a
    different result.  Counsel submits that
    in light of <i>Khelawon</i>, the evidentiary
    inquiry into the reliability of Trish’s statement that the appellant was with
    her is expanded to include evidence other than evidence relating to the
    circumstances in which the statement was made.  Counsel submits that on this expanded review of reliability, the
    evidence of a telephone conversation between Trish and a man named Jeffrey Clarke
    a few minutes before the conversation with Ms. Bielawski casts doubt on the
    reliability of Trish’s statement that she was with the appellant when speaking
    to Ms. Bielawski.  The admissibility of
    the conversation between Mr. Clarke and Trish was contested at trial as part of
    the same omnibus pre-trial <i>voir dire </i>during
    which the admissibility of the conversation with Ms. Bielawski was argued.  The defence unsuccessfully resisted the
    admissibility of the Clarke conversation arguing that the evidence of the
    contents of the conversation was unreliable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is unclear from the trial record whether the
    evidence relating to the Clarke conversation is properly considered in deciding
    whether the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the conversation
    with Ms. Bielawski.  Understandably,
    given the state of the law, no connection was made at trial between the Clarke
    conversation and the admissibility of the conversation with Ms. Bielawski.  Attempts to reshape the record upon which
    admissibility was determined at trial to accommodate legal arguments based on changes
    in the law of evidence subsequent to the trial must adversely affect the
    integrity of the trial process:  <i>R. v. Polimac</i> (2010), 254 C.C.C. (3d)
    359 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to the S.C.C. requested, at paras. 59-60<span
class=GramE>.  However</span>, as the
    record is not entirely clear, and in fairness to the appellant, I will assume
    that the Clarke conversation is properly considered in determining whether the
    trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Trish’s statement to Ms. Bielawski.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In holding that the evidence of Trish’s
    statement that she was with the appellant was admissible hearsay, the trial
    judge emphasized that “the subject matter of the call was mundane and routine
    between two close friends.”  He further
    noted that the “conversation was spontaneous and the declarant [Trish] was
    speaking about contemporaneous events.”  The trial judge also held, after a careful analysis of this court’s
    decision in <i>R. v. Czibulka</i> (2004),
    189 C.C.C. (3d) 199 (Ont. C.A.), that he was satisfied that he could infer that
    Trish had no motive to lie to her friend about whom Trish was with at the time
    of the telephone call.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s factual findings, including
    the inferences drawn from primary facts, and his reliability assessment are
    entitled to deference absent any material misapprehension of the evidence or
    error in principle:  see <i>R. v. Blackman</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 298, at
    para. 36; <i>R. v. Moo</i> (2009), 247
    C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Ont. C.A.); and <i>Polimac</i> at para. 61.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Trish was, of course, unavailable for
    cross-examination at trial.  There were no
    substitutes for cross-examination, such as cross-examination of Trish on the
    statement at some earlier proceeding, which could mitigate the inability to
    cross-examine Trish at trial.  The trial
    judge correctly recognized that the admissibility of the statement turned entirely
    on whether the circumstances in which the statement was made provided
    sufficient indicators of the inherent trustworthiness of the statement to
    render cross-examination of the declarant at trial an unnecessary prerequisite
    to admissibility.  As Charron J. put it
    in <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 62, when
    discussing reliability in the context of the admissibility of hearsay evidence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>One way [to demonstrate reliability] is to show that
    there is no real concern about whether the statement is true or not because of
    the circumstances in which it came about.  Common sense dictates that if we can put sufficient trust in the truth
    and accuracy of the statement, it should be considered by the fact finder
    regardless of its hearsay form.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As identified in <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, at pp. 935-36, cross-examination
    of a declarant may target the accuracy of a statement or the honesty of the
    witness who made the statement or both.  Insofar as Trish’s statement that she was with the appellant is
    concerned, there could be no possible advantage in cross-examining her about
    the accuracy of that statement.  The
    appellant’s presence with Trish when she spoke to her friend was not something
    that Trish could possibly have been mistaken about.  If the statement was unreliable, it was
    because Trish may have been lying about the appellant’s presence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In determining the admissibility of hearsay
    statements, a trial judge begins with the presumption that the evidence is
    inadmissible:  <i>Blackman </i>at para. 37.  Where,
    as in a case like this, reliability turns on the circumstances in which the
    statement was made, and the challenge to the reliability is based on the
    possibility that Trish was lying and that cross-examination could disclose that
    possibility, I think the evidence can be admitted only if the trial judge is
    satisfied that there is no realistic possibility that Trish was lying when she
    told her friend that she was with the appellant.  I see this approach as reflecting the
    analysis in <i>Khelawon</i>.  Charron J., in the course of applying the
    general principles to the statements made in that case and holding the
    statements to be inadmissible hearsay, said at para. 107: “[T]he circumstances <i>raised a number of serious issues such that
    it would be impossible to say that the evidence was unlikely to change under
    cross-examination</i>” (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge identified circumstances that
    made out a cogent case for the reliability of Trish’s statement.  She and her friend were engaged in a routine
    social conversation about mundane matters.  The reference to the appellant’s presence came up as an aside in the
    course of that conversation.  The
    conversation was not an inquiry into <span class=GramE>whom</span> Trish was
    with at that time, but was rather a discussion between friends about a possible
    meeting later that day.  I also accept
    the trial judge’s finding that on the evidence there was no plausible motive for
    Trish to lie to her friend about being with the appellant.  This finding can be contrasted with the comments
    in<i> <span class=GramE>Smith<span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></span> </i>a case heavily relied on by the
    appellant, where Lamer C.J.C. notes, at p. 936, that there was evidence from
    which it could be inferred that the declarant had a reason to lie to her mother
    in the relevant telephone call.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant attempts to undermine
    the credibility of Trish’s statement that she was with the appellant by referring
    to evidence that could potentially impugn Trish’s credibility on other matters.  For example, there was evidence that Trish
    had lied to Ms. Bielawski about working at the massage parlour.  In my view, that evidence is irrelevant to
    the inherent trustworthiness of Trish’s statement to Ms. Bielawski that she was
    with the appellant.  Given the nature of
    the employment and Trish’s youth, there were obvious reasons for her to mislead
    people, including Ms. Bielawski, about where she worked.  I see no connection between the potential to
    mislead her friend on her place of employment and Trish’s potential to mislead
    her friend about the appellant’s presence during a casual telephone conversation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant also referred to
    evidence of other things that Trish had done, of which Ms. Bielawski was
    unaware, in support of his argument that the statement to Ms. Bielawski was unreliable.  Evidence that Trish did not tell Ms. Bielawski
    about certain things that were going on is irrelevant to Trish’s credibility on
    a general level, much less to the reliability of her statement that she was
    with the appellant when Ms. Bielawski spoke to her on the telephone.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the law as it stood when the ruling was made,
    there are no grounds to successfully challenge the trial judge’s ruling.  After <i>Khelawon</i>,
    the reliability inquiry can extend beyond the circumstances of the making of
    the statement.  Counsel submits that this
    court must reassess the admissibility of Trish’s statement to Ms. Bielawski
    using the wider reliability lens described in <i>Khelawon</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel submits that the wider lens crafted in <i>Khelawon</i> captures the evidence of a
    conversation between Jeffrey Clarke and Trish.  Trish had met Clarke about five days before her death.  They had one five minute conversation and
    exchanged phone numbers.  Mr. Clarke telephoned
    Trish at 2:30 p.m. on July 7, 2001, a few moments before Trish spoke to Ms. Bielawski.  According to Mr. Clarke, Trish was in a
    rush.  She told Mr. Clarke that she was
    with “another guy”.  Mr. Clarke thought that
    she said she was with “Matt” or “Mike”, but agreed that she may have said she
    was with “Monte”.  The appellant’s
    nickname is “Monte”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is somewhat speculative to attempt on appeal to
    assess the impact of Clarke’s evidence on the reliability of Trish’s statement
    to Ms. Bielawski when the two were not connected during the trial.  It is, however, necessary to make that
    assessment given the approach to hearsay pronounced in <i>Khelawon</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not think that Mr. Clarke’s evidence
    undermines the reliability of the statement Trish made to Ms. Bielawski.  Trish barely knew Mr. Clarke and by his
    admission seemed anxious to end the telephone conversation quickly.  Trish certainly did not have a relationship
    with Mr. Clarke that would suggest any trust or friendship between the two of
    them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Most importantly, however, Mr. Clarke was uncertain
    of the name used by the appellant.  Mr.
    Clarke, who had only spoken to Trish once, acknowledged that he found her
    difficult to understand because of her accent.  On balance, I do not think that Mr. Clarke’s evidence as to what Trish
    said to him is necessarily inconsistent with her statement to her friend Ms. Bielawski,
    a few minutes later, that she was with the appellant.  The evidence of the Clarke conversation does
    not give cause to question the correctness of the trial judge’s ruling on the
    admissibility of Trish’s statement to Ms. Bielawski.  </p>
  <h4>Issue 2: <span class=GramE>The</span> Crown’s Cross-Examination of Ranjit
    and Ms. Sanghera </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the
    Crown’s cross-examination of Ranjit and Ms. Sanghera was so improper as to
    result in a miscarriage of justice.  Counsel contends that the Crown’s conduct towards those witnesses would
    inevitably have had a negative impact on the jury’s assessment of their
    credibility.  Both witnesses offered
    evidence that, if not totally rejected, would have resulted in an
    acquittal.  Counsel further submits that apart
    from any effect the improper cross-examination had on the witness’s
    credibility, that cross-examination so departed from the standards demanded of Crown
    counsel that it destroyed the appearance of the fairness of the trial and resulted
    in a miscarriage of justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not propose to examine each of the many specific
    extracts from the cross-examinations relied on by the appellant in support of
    this ground of appeal.  Many of those
    extracts placed in their proper context do not reveal anything improper in
    Crown counsel’s cross-examination.  In
    any event, <span class=GramE>counsel agree</span> that the merit of this ground
    of appeal must be determined by reference to the cumulative effect of the improprieties
    during the cross-examinations considered in the context of the entirety of the
    trial.  Reference to isolated passages
    can be misleading both by overstating and understating the effect of
    improprieties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also see no need to listen to the audiotapes
    of the cross-examination to resolve this ground of appeal.  Counsel for the appellant did not refer to
    anything specific that, in his submission, would be assisted by listening to
    the audiotapes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There were instances, and more than a few, where
    Crown counsel’s cross-examination went beyond the appropriately vigorous to the
    improperly aggressive and demeaning.  Crown counsel on appeal properly concedes that the Crown at trial, an
    experienced and able counsel, engaged in sarcasm and editorializing during the
    cross-examination of these two witnesses.  Both tactics are inappropriate, especially for Crown counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also agree with counsel for the appellant that
    Crown counsel on more than one occasion presented himself in the cross-examination
    of these witnesses as the spokesperson for the jury.  This tactic unfairly implies that the Crown and
    its interests are aligned with the jury against the accused and his interest.  Whatever may be said about the effectiveness
    of this technique as an advocacy tool, it is unavailable to the Crown who must
    maintain an objectivity and impartiality consistent with his or her obligations
    to the administration of justice:  see <i>R. v. F.S.</i> (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 466 (Ont.
    C.A.), at pp. 473-74.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accepting that the Crown did engage in some
    improper cross-examination of both witnesses, the effect of those improprieties
    must be placed in the context of the entire trial.  This was a difficult, hard fought and, in
    many ways, nasty trial.  The Crown was
    faced with witnesses who were changing their stories and, by their own
    admission, had lied under oath.  The
    defence had advanced an attack not only on the competence and integrity of the
    police investigation but on the integrity of the Crown prosecutor.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ranjit and Ms. Sanghera, the two witnesses whose
    evidence is in issue on this ground of appeal, were difficult witnesses to
    cross-examine.  They were far from
    shrinking violets and were not in any way intimidated by the Crown’s aggressive
    and, at times, improper cross-examination.  Some of the Crown’s editorializing was a direct product of the manner in
    which the witnesses conducted themselves on the witness stand.  The Crown was obligated to forcefully probe
    and challenge the evidence of both Ranjit and Ms. Sanghera.  He did so, and in most respects, he did so in
    a proper and effective manner.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It must also be remembered that the impugned
    parts of the cross-examinations occurred during lengthy cross-examinations
    which took place in the course of a lengthy trial.  There is no complaint about Crown counsel’s
    conduct in the rest of the trial.  Nor
    are there any complaints about the manner in which the trial judge conducted
    the proceedings.  He gave the jury a
    fair, careful and effective jury instruction.  That instruction included a description of the jury’s role and an
    admonition that statements made by counsel in the course of the trial were
    irrelevant to the jury’s role.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am satisfied that the improper parts of Crown
    counsel’s cross-examinations of these two witnesses could not have had any effect
    on the jury’s assessment of their credibility.  Nothing done by the Crown prevented the witnesses from fully telling
    their story.  The exculpatory portions of
    their evidence were far from credible.  I
    think the jury would inevitably have made much more of the inherent and obvious
    frailties in the witnesses’ evidence than it would have made of the Crown’s
    unfortunate use of sarcasm and editorial comment from time to time during the
    cross-examinations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span

    during cross-examination to undermine the overall appearance of the fairness of
    the trial, weight must be given to the position taken by the participants in
    the trial.  There was no request for a
    mistrial.  Defence counsel did not ask
    the court to address any of the alleged improprieties in any way with the jury.  In my view, the improper parts of the cross-examinations
    are properly viewed as relatively isolated events that were clearly collateral to
    the focus of the evidence adduced at trial.  I have every confidence that the jury decided this case “on the evidence”
    as it was instructed to do by the trial judge.      </p>
  <h4>Issue 3:  The Absence of a Limiting

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sergeant Baron, the lead investigator, was cross-examined
    for three days.  Defence counsel
    attempted to demonstrate in that cross-examination that the police were aware
    of evidence pointing to several other suspects, but did not follow up on that
    evidence.  Defence counsel also cross-examined
    Sergeant Baron to show that the case against the appellant was based largely on
    the statements allegedly made to the police by his brothers and father.  Counsel’s purpose was clear.  She wanted to show that the police had
    focused their investigation on the appellant to the exclusion of other viable
    suspects and that when that investigation failed to uncover sufficient evidence
    against the <span class=GramE>appellant,</span> the police coerced statements
    from his relatives to make their case against the appellant.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the course of the lengthy cross-examination
    of Sergeant Baron, counsel elicited a great deal of hearsay evidence concerning
    other potential suspects, steps taken to investigate those suspects, and other
    facets of the police investigation.  Counsel also elicited from Sergeant Baron, not only his own opinion
    about the state of the investigation at various points and time, but also his
    understanding of the opinion of other officers concerning facets of the
    investigation.  This evidence appeared
    designed to show first, that Sergeant Baron had certain fixed opinions which
    were not subject to change regardless of the evidence, and second, that certain
    officers at certain points in the investigation regarded the circumstantial
    evidence tying the appellant to the homicide as far from strong.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not surprisingly, defence counsel’s line of
    questioning led Sergeant Baron to explain why the police took steps that they
    did and the manner in which they treated the evidence of other potential
    suspects.  In the course of defending the
    investigation against counsel’s attack, Sergeant Baron made it clear that in
    his opinion the investigation was thorough, proper, had eliminated other
    potential suspects, and that the appellant was the killer.  None of this evidence could possibly have
    come as a surprise to defence counsel.  </p>

    the relevant parts of Sergeant Baron’s evidence were elicited on
    cross-examination.  He also accepts that
    there was no request for any kind of a limiting instruction.  He submits, however, that the trial judge was
    obliged in law to instruct the jury, at a minimum, that the hearsay parts of the
    evidence could not be used by the Crown to support its case and that the jury
    should disregard Sergeant Baron’s personal opinions about the guilt of the
    appellant.  Counsel relies on <i>R. v. Van</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In oral argument, counsel acknowledged that this
    ground of appeal, standing alone, would not merit a new trial.  He submitted that it could, however, give
    added significance to the other errors alleged.  As I am satisfied the other two grounds of appeal fail, it is not
    necessary for me to decide this ground.  I will, however, address it briefly.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This case is not like <i>Van</i>.  In that case, the impugned
    opinion evidence was elicited by the Crown and in a manner that suggested that
    the officer was aware of other facts unknown to the jury.  Here, the impugned evidence was elicited entirely
    on cross-examination as part of a calculated defence strategy.  Nothing said by Sergeant Baron suggested that
    he was relying on information unavailable to the jury.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s failure to request a limiting
    instruction must be taken to have been a tactical decision.  Counsel had the trial judge’s charge in draft
    form days before it was delivered.  She
    did not request any limiting instruction.  In her closing address, counsel made wide use of the hearsay evidence
    elicited from Sergeant Baron to support the contention that there were other
    viable suspects and that the police investigation was inadequate.  A limiting instruction might have compromised
    defence counsel’s submission that the jury should take a broad view of Sergeant
    Baron’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Jury instructions are not an abstract
    dissertation on the fine points of criminal law or evidence.  They are plain language directions intended
    to assist the jury in arriving at a true verdict.  To fulfil that role, the instructions must be
    tailored to the issues raised and the positions taken at trial.  The trial judge put Sergeant Baron’s evidence
    to the jury as it was elicited by the defence.  Defence counsel had obviously decided that from the defence perspective,
    the less said about any limits on the jury’s use of Sergeant Baron’s evidence
    the better it would be for the defence.  Counsel
    for the appellant cannot undo those tactical decisions several years later and
    criticize the trial judge for not including a limiting instruction that is
    inconsistent with the manner in which the defence was conducted at trial.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>The Crown brought a fresh
    evidence application.  According to that
    application, Ranjit pled guilty in 2007 to a perjury charge arising out of his
    trial testimony.  The Crown argues on
    appeal that this court should take that guilty plea into consideration in
    assessing the significance of any purported alibi offered by Ranjit.  As I would dismiss the appeal without regard
    to the proposed fresh evidence, I need not determine whether Ranjit’s
    subsequent guilty plea would be admissible as fresh evidence on this appeal.</span></p>
