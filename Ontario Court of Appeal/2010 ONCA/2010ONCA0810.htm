  <h2 class=HeadingNumber><strong><span style="text-decoration:none">I:&nbsp; Introduction</span></strong></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of this case raise a difficult problem familiar to those who
    must make disposition orders in respect of persons found not criminally
    responsible (NCR) on account of a mental disorder.  The appellant is mentally
    ill.  That illness is exacerbated by the appellant’s consumption of marijuana
    and, to a lesser degree, his use of alcohol.  The appellant’s symptoms can be
    controlled by medication, but when left to his own devices, especially when
    under the influence of drugs, the appellant does not take his medication.  The
    appellant has made it clear, including in a statement to this court in oral
    submissions, that he regards the use of marijuana as a religious practice and
    that he fully intends to continue the use of marijuana.  It is almost
    inevitable that if the appellant is left on his own in the community, he will
    abuse the consumption of marijuana and stop taking his medication.  These two
    events combined will lead to a significant deterioration in the appellant’s
    mental state within a relatively short time.  With that deterioration will come
    conduct that is anti-social and probably criminal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has a long history (10 years) of psychiatric illness exacerbated
    by substance abuse.  He has engaged in conduct that is bizarre, disturbing to
    his family and those around him and, on occasion, criminal.  With the possible
    exception of one event involving his father, he has never engaged in physically
    assaultive behaviour.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is almost certain that the appellant will engage in anti-social
    and criminal conduct if left on his own in the community, the crucial question
    is whether that conduct will pose  “a significant threat to the safety of the
    public”.  Unless the Review Board could be satisfied that the appellant’s conduct
    would pose that threat, the Review Board was obliged to absolutely discharge
    the appellant regardless of the negative effect that order might have on both
    the appellant’s ability to function in society and health care professionals’
    ability to treat the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Review Board, after a hearing in April 2010, concluded that the
    appellant did pose a significant threat to the safety of the public.  The
    Review Board ordered the appellant detained in the Regional Mental Health Care
    St. Thomas (RMHC St. Thomas).  The Review Board had also made detention orders
    in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.  In all of those orders, the Review Board had
    allowed the appellant to live in the community at a place approved by the
    person in charge of RMHC St. Thomas.  The appellant had lived in the community
    for much of the time he was under the Review Board’s jurisdiction.  This
    condition was removed from the 2010 order. Instead, the appellant was allowed, at
    the discretion of the person in charge, to live in the community for up to one
    week, twice a year.  This variation from the earlier orders made the 2010 order
    the most restrictive order that had been imposed on the appellant by the Review
    Board.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the Review Board’s finding that he posed a
    significant threat to the safety of the public is unreasonable.  He submits
    that he is entitled to an absolute discharge.  <i>Amicus curiae</i>, Ms.
    Szigeti, who has provided her customary able assistance to the court, supports
    the appellant’s submission.  She further submits that if the Review Board’s
    finding that the appellant posed a significant threat to the public stands, the
    imposition of a detention order cannot reasonably be said to constitute the
    least onerous and least restrictive disposition.  She submits that a
    conditional discharge is the appropriate order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the Attorney General, joined by counsel for RMHC St. Thomas,
    submits that the Review Board’s determination that the appellant represented a
    significant threat to the safety of the public was reasonable and supported by
    the evidence.  Counsel further argues that the disposition, while admittedly
    more onerous than previous dispositions, was an appropriate one under the legislative
    scheme set out in Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. 
    Counsel for the Attorney General emphasizes that the appellant’s habitual use
    of marijuana and his refusal to follow his medication regime while in the
    community have repeatedly led to episodes in which the appellant’s mental
    stability rapidly deteriorates.  Counsel for the Attorney General submits that
    an order giving RMHC St. Thomas control over the appellant’s access to the community
    and the ability to remove him quickly from the community and stabilize his
    mental condition, balances the various interests described in s. 672.54 of the <i>Code</i>. 
      </p>
  <h2><span style='text-decoration:none'>II:  The Significant Risk Requirement in
    Section 672.54</span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An accused who is found NCR cannot be punished for his or her criminal
    act.  Any post-verdict limitation on the liberty of the person found NCR must
    be justified on the basis that he or she poses an ongoing danger to the
    community:  <i>R. v. Owen</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at para. 25.  That
    constitutionally mandated precondition to restriction on liberty finds its
    statutory expression in s. 672.54(a).  That section provides that if the Review
    Board concludes that the NCR accused does not pose “a significant threat to the
    safety of the public”, the Review Board must order an absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The meaning of the phrase “significant threat to the safety of the
    public” has been authoritatively set down in <i>Winko v. British Columbia
    (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at paras. 49-62, 69. 
    The phrase refers to a foreseeable and substantial risk of physical or
    psychological harm to members of the public that is serious and beyond the trivial
    or annoying.  A very small risk of even grave harm will not suffice.  A high
    risk of relatively trivial harm will also not meet the substantial harm
    standard.  While the conduct must be criminal in nature, not all criminal
    conduct will suffice to establish a substantial risk.  There must be a risk
    that the NCR accused will commit a “serious criminal offence”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no presumption that an NCR accused poses a significant threat
    to the safety of the public and there is no obligation on the NCR accused to
    prove lack of dangerousness.  If upon a review of the evidence, the Review
    Board is satisfied that the NCR accused poses a significant risk, then limits
    on the liberty of the NCR accused are justified and the Review Board must
    determine the appropriate order.  However, if the Review Board is satisfied
    that the NCR accused does not pose a significant risk, or if the Review Board
    is unable to come to a conclusion on the question of the risk posed by the NCR
    accused, the Review Board must order an absolute discharge: <i>Winko</i> at
    paras. 52, 57, 62.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The assessment of potential risk is often somewhat uncertain compared to
    fact finding in respect of prior events.  The Review Board has a wide power to
    receive and gather evidence.  Its composition also ensures a level of expertise
    in evaluating the medical and social factors associated with risk assessment: <i>Winko </i>at paras. 59-61.  </p>
  <h2><span style='text-decoration:none'>III:  The Reasonableness Standard of
    Review</span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court does not decide whether the appellant poses a significant threat
    to the safety of the public.  That is the Review Board’s function and one for
    which it has special expertise.  This court’s responsibility is to decide
    whether the Review Board’s determination that the appellant poses such a substantial
    risk to the safety of the public is a reasonable one:  <i>Owen</i> at paras.
    31-35.  In performing that function, the court must recognize the Review
    Board’s expertise and afford deference to its risk assessments.  The nature of
    the reasonableness review is explained in <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated by
    the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of
    reasonableness:  certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do
    not lend themselves to one specific, particular result.  Instead, they may give
    rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions.  Tribunals have a margin
    of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions.  A court
    conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a
    decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons
    and to outcomes.  In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with
    the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the
    decision-making process.  But it is also concerned with whether the decision
    falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in
    respect of the facts and law.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is 27 years old.  He has lived his entire life in the St.
    Thomas area.  His mother suffers from mental illness and his upbringing was far
    from ideal.  The appellant has been mentally ill since he was a teenager.  His regular
    use of marijuana began around the same time.  The appellant was admitted to RMHC
    St. Thomas on seven occasions between September 2001 and December 2005 because
    of his mental illness.  On the first occasion in September 2001, he presented
    at the hospital as delusional, disorganized and withdrawn.  He was diagnosed as
    schizophrenic with a drug induced mental disorder. That diagnosis has remained
    basically the same since then.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was released in February 2002, only to be returned to RMHC
    St. Thomas some seven days later.  He was irritable, angry and voicing delusional
    thoughts.  His behaviour was considered threatening.  He reluctantly agreed to
    start medication and responded well to that medication.  He was discharged on
    May 29, 2002.  When allowed to leave RMHC St. Thomas, he maintained only
    minimal contact with the workers at the hospital.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was admitted for a third time in early June 2002.  He was
    paranoid with grandiose delusions.  Medication was commenced and he responded
    well.  He was discharged to a group home on June 24, 2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was admitted to RMHC St. Thomas for a fourth time on
    January 1, 2004.  The police had been called when the appellant had threatened
    to kill himself.  He was very agitated and suspicious when admitted to the
    hospital.  He had apparently expressed some homicidal ideation.  The appellant
    initially refused any treatment, but subsequently agreed to begin taking
    medication.  Within a couple of days of taking the medication, his condition
    improved.  He was discharged on January 15, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s fifth admission to RMHC St. Thomas occurred on April 1,
    2004.  His mother called the police when the appellant damaged furniture in her
    apartment during an angry outburst.  The appellant was verbally abusive on
    admission, but settled quickly.  He admitted using marijuana while away from
    the hospital.  The appellant was delusional.  He was discharged in May 2004.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was admitted to RMHC St. Thomas for a sixth time in
    October 2004 and remained there until February 2005, although he did receive several
    weekend passes.  As on the other occasions, the appellant was paranoid and
    suffering from various specific delusions when admitted to the hospital.  He
    admitted that he had again stopped taking his medication when released from the
    hospital and began the consumption of marijuana and alcohol.  The appellant,
    again, was placed on medication and responded well before his discharge later in
    February 2005.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was admitted to RMHC St. Thomas for a seventh time on
    December 4, 2005.  He told the hospital staff that he had quit taking his
    medication and resumed using marijuana on a regular basis.  He told them that
    he used marijuana for religious reasons.  The appellant was agitated but not
    physically threatening.  He was released on December 7, 2005.  Five days later,
    his sister had to ask him to leave the house as his anger was getting out of
    control.  On December 15, his father reported that the appellant had become
    quite aggressive, punched the wall and yelled at his father.  The appellant’s father
    was concerned that the appellant would become physically aggressive.<a

    one charge of breach of recognizance.  The first mischief offence occurred on
    May 24, 2005.  The police were called by the appellant’s roommate who advised
    them that the appellant was smashing items in the apartment, including glasses
    and beer bottles.  The appellant told the police that he had not taken his
    medication that day.  He was released on a recognizance.</p>

    appellant was walking away from the police station after speaking with an
    officer in the parking lot.  The officer watched as the appellant kicked at and
    broke a window in a nearby business establishment.  He then casually walked
    away.  The appellant was arrested and charged with mischief and breach of his
    bail order.  The appellant offered various bizarre explanations for breaking
    the window.  He was released on an undertaking on the condition that he report
    to RMHC St. Thomas.    </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Review Board’s first disposition following the NCR finding was made in
    April 2006.  Following the hospital’s recommendation, the Review Board ordered
    the appellant detained at RMHC St. Thomas but provided a condition which
    allowed him to live in the community in an accommodation approved by the person
    in charge of RMHC St. Thomas.  The appellant was also ordered to abstain from
    the use of marijuana and provide urine samples for drug testing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant moved out of RMHC St. Thomas into the community in June
    2006.  He did quite well in the ensuing nine months.  Although he had little,
    if any, insight into his mental illness and he continued to be delusional, the
    appellant largely refrained from the use of marijuana.  He tested positive for
    marijuana only once between June 2006 and March 2007.  The appellant also continued
    to take his medication and seemed to appreciate that it had some value for him. 
    He did, however, unilaterally reduce the dosage.  His overall mental stability improved
    and he regained relationships with his family, sister, father and some friends.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first annual review of the appellant’s disposition order occurred in
    March 2007.  RMHC St. Thomas took the position that the appellant continued to
    pose a significant threat of physical or psychological harm to members of the
    public, and recommended that the same order be continued for another year.  RMHC
    St. Thomas stressed that the appellant was unlikely to continue his medication
    if released and that it needed the ability to return him to the hospital
    quickly, if needed, and to control where he lived in the community.  The Review
    Board accepted the hospital’s position and made the same order it had made a
    year earlier.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant reacted very badly to the Review Board’s detention order
    in March 2007.  He felt very strongly that the order was unjust and that he
    should not be required to spend more than a year under the control of the
    Review Board and the personnel at RMHC St. Thomas.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An unhappy pattern emerged after the Review Board’s detention order in
    March 2007.  That pattern continued under the detention orders of 2008 and
    2009.    While in the hospital, the appellant took his medication, did not use
    marijuana, was relatively stable and able to function.  He was then released
    into the community where he returned to the use of marijuana and did not take
    his medication as required, leading to a relatively quick deterioration in his
    mental state producing paranoid delusions and bizarre and sometimes aggressive
    conduct.  That conduct resulted in the appellant’s return to RMHC St. Thomas
    and the cycle began anew.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If anything, the appellant’s ability to live in the community seems to
    have diminished over the years.  For example, he was returned to RMHC St.
    Thomas from the community no less than four times between March 2009 and March
    2010.  The appellant has continued to use marijuana and continued to refuse to
    take his medication when in the community.  He has also become less cooperative
    and somewhat more confrontational with the mental health personnel who are
    trying to help him.  However, there have been some positive developments over
    the past three years.  For example, the appellant did manage to complete the
    course work needed to obtain his high school diploma and has also taken other
    computer related courses.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s pattern of conduct is typified by the events in the
    several months immediately prior to the Review Board hearing in April 2010. 
    The appellant was living in the community in the summer of 2009, but was
    returned to RMHC St. Thomas in August 2009 in consequence of non-compliance
    with the terms of his release.  He was using marijuana, was delusional and had made
    a series of “bizarre decisions”.  Upon his return to the hospital, the
    appellant was cooperative and quickly received further passes to live in the
    community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was returned to RMHC St. Thomas when he tested positive
    for cannabis in October 2009.  Once again, he settled quickly and was
    cooperative.  Hospital staff reported a significant improvement in his mental
    state.  He was again allowed to go back into the community only to return to
    the hospital in January 2010 after testing positive for marijuana use.  The
    appellant was living in the community on a pass at the time of the Review Board
    hearing in April 2010.  </p>

    <h2><span style='text-decoration:
none'>(d)  Opinion of the Attending Physician</span></h2>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to October 2009, the appellant’s attending physician, Dr. Ellis, had
    consistently taken the position that the appellant represented a significant threat
    to the safety of the public.  For example, in February 2008, he wrote:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is the opinion of the treatment team that Mr.
    Ferguson continues to pose a significant threat of physical or psychological
    harm to the safety of the public.  He continues to use cannabis and when he
    does, he becomes psychotic and disorganized.  <u>When regressed, he is at
    similar risk as at the time of the index offence and other activities that were
    dangerous and disturbing to others.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2009, Dr. Ellis and the treatment staff for the first time
    opined that the appellant was not a significant threat to the public and that
    he should be discharged absolutely.  The report prepared by the treatment team
    contained the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>The treatment team had extensive discussions in
    attempting to formulate a risk assessment and come to the conclusion that Mr.
    Ferguson likely does not meet the threshold of significant threat at this
    time.  </u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Currently, Mr. Ferguson remains very delusional
    which is more than likely due at least in part to his ongoing use of cannabis,
    but whether or not the threat he presents to members of the public constitutes
    a real and potentially serious risk is debatable, having regard to the nature
    of the index offence and the fact that he has not been physically assaultive
    notwithstanding ongoing use of cannabis and an increase in symptoms of his
    psychosis over the last number of years and the last year or two in
    particular.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Past assessments of significant threat have made
    clear the connection between exacerbations of Mr. Ferguson’s chronically
    delusional mental state, his use of cannabis and the likelihood of him acting
    out in an aggressive manner.  While most aspects of Mr. Ferguson’s presentation
    including his illness structure, lack of insight into his index offence, mental
    illness and need for medication, repeated violation of Disposition by ongoing
    use of cannabis, poor participation in treatment and lack of appropriate
    supports remain unchanged from previous years, he has not, despite risk
    predictions to the contrary, acted out in a way that puts others in the
    community at serious risk of harm thus putting the likelihood of him posing a
    threat to others more firmly within the realm of speculation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Mr. Ferguson can present as very symptomatic, and
    without treatment, support and follow up for his mental illness it seems very
    likely that he will become increasingly ill.  He will find it challenging to
    maintain safe and stable housing in the community and is at extreme risk for
    “the revolving door syndrome” in terms of repeat admissions to psychiatric
    facilities.  He may very well come to the attention of police in the future but
    it is difficult to predict with any confidence that such contact would more
    likely than not come about as a result of involvement in acts that post a real
    and serious harm or threat of harm to others.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Based on the recommendation of the treatment team
    that Mr. Ferguson no longer constitutes a significant threat of physical or
    psychological harm to the public, the person in charge is recommending that Mr.
    Ferguson be discharged absolutely.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Ellis testified before the Review Board in April 2010.  He advised
    the Review Board that he and the treatment staff no longer held the opinion set
    out in the October 2009 report.  Dr. Ellis and the treatment team had reverted
    to their earlier opinion that the appellant did pose a significant threat to
    the safety of the public.  When asked to explain why the position had changed between
    October 2009 and the hearing in April 2010, Dr. Ellis responded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.   No, on, on reviewing his course in therapy with
    us and prior, I came to appreciate that I -- <u>I think that absent a
    disposition order, we will recreate for him the same situation that existed
    prior to that being on the disposition order which was one of increasingly
    unwellness, non-compliance, use of drugs, and increasing aggressive behaviour,
    and, and that is a concern to me.</u>  I do grant that he hasn’t any sort of
    criminal record of, of note other than the one carrying a concealed weapon when
    he was -- I can’t remember how old, around 20 or 21, I think, and, and there
    have been no further criminal charges.  And I guess that is the, the -- is what
    the Board will have to struggle with, but I would be concerned.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Ellis also expressed concern that if the appellant’s condition
    deteriorated, he could “become more aggressive and hurt someone”.  Dr. Ellis
    acknowledged that the appellant had not previously acted in that way, although
    he did refer to an occasion prior to 2005 when the appellant threatened his
    father and frightened him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The chairperson put a series of questions to Dr. Ellis directed at the
    risk posed by the appellant to the public:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.  Now, in your opinion, if he were granted an
    absolute discharge, is there a foreseeable and substantial risk that he would
    commit a serious offence involving that he would be likelihood to commit a
    serious offence involving physical or psychological harm?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.  I, <u>I think that there is very foreseeable
    likelihood that he would become ill and commit an offence.</u>  My guess is
    whether or not you feel that -- and I think the pattern would, would become that
    which was developing prior to the index offence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.  Yes, and would that escalate -- <u>is, is there
    a substantial risk that that would escalate to physical violence?</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.  <u>I have concerns about that, yes.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.  <u>It, it would?</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.  <u>I have concern that it would.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.  <u>Substantial risk that it would?</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.  <u>I think so.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.  Even though in the past it perhaps fortunately
    did not escalate to actual physical violence here?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.  It has never actually done that ...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.  <u>But that doesn’t mean to say it won’t happen
    in the future, and you think there’s a, a foreseeable and substantial risk that
    it, that it would?</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.  <u>I think he was on track to accomplishing that
    before he was arrested and charged for a very minor offence, and, and then put
    into this system which has monitored.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h2>V:  Was the Review Board’s Decision that the Appellant Posed a Significant
    Risk to the Safety of the Public Unreasonable?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Review Board concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Ferguson continues to pose a significant and
    serious threat of physical harm to members of the public.  The Board accepts
    the opinion of Dr. Ellis that, if Mr. Ferguson was granted an Absolute Discharge,
    he would discontinue his medication, would resume the regular use of marijuana,
    become psychotic and aggressive, <u>and would likely cause physical injury to
    members of the public.</u>  Although he had not been physically assaultive, he
    had been physically threatening to the point of frightening others, and the
    level of his aggression raised the likelihood that it would have escalated to
    physical violence if it had been left untreated.  The test in <i>Winko</i> is
    clearly satisfied in this case.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching its conclusion, the Review Board appropriately relied
    heavily on Dr. Ellis’ opinion:  <i>Winko</i> at para. 61. Not only did Dr.
    Ellis have the expertise of a practising psychiatrist, he was intimately
    familiar with the appellant and his course of treatment and conduct over the
    last several years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, however, the Review Board overstated Dr. Ellis’ opinion.  In
    the extracts quoted above, Dr. Ellis opined that there was a foreseeable
    likelihood that the appellant would commit an offence.  He acknowledged
    “concerns” that the appellant’s conduct would pose a substantial risk that
    could escalate to physical violence.  Dr. Ellis offered the further opinion
    that the appellant seemed on his way some five years earlier to committing
    crimes involving physical violence before he was “put into the system”.  I do
    not read Dr. Ellis as offering the definitive opinion that it was likely that
    the appellant would engage in conduct that would cause physical injury to
    members of the public.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Review Board also failed to consider the effect of Dr. Ellis’
    opinion, expressed only some six months earlier, that the appellant did not
    constitute a significant risk to the safety of the public.  Dr. Ellis was, of
    course, at liberty to change his opinion.  No one criticizes him for doing so. 
    However, in assessing the weight to be given to the opinion he gave at the
    hearing, the Review Board was obliged to consider the different opinion provided
    only six months earlier and the reasons offered for the change in his opinion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The opinion advanced by Dr. Ellis and the treatment team in October 2009
    was based on the notion that past conduct over a sufficient period of time is
    the best prognosticator of future conduct.  In the eight years that the appellant
    had been involved with the treatment team at RMHC St. Thomas, he had not
    exhibited physically violent conduct towards others.  The index offences were
    minor and property related.  His psychiatric condition remained unchanged.  In
    effect, Dr. Ellis opined that the appellant would continue to behave as he had
    in the past.  That behaviour had not presented a significant risk to the safety
    of the public.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Ellis did not change his opinion based on anything that happened
    between October 2009 and April 2010, or on any new information that had not
    been available to Dr. Ellis in October 2009.  Quite simply, Dr. Ellis had
    second thoughts.  Having regard to the appellant’s condition and his
    psychiatric history, Dr. Ellis returned to the opinion he had expressed on
    various occasions before October 2009.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it was appropriate for Dr. Ellis to rethink his position, the Review
    Board was required to take into account the fact that Dr. Ellis had arrived at
    a different opinion based on the same information only six months earlier. 
    This was clearly a close call for Dr. Ellis.  Considering the change in his
    opinion and the guarded manner in which he expressed his opinion at the April 2010
    hearing, I think Dr. Ellis’ assessment of whether the appellant posed a
    significant risk to the public is best characterized as uncertain.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Review Board was required to grant an absolute discharge unless the
    evidence reasonably permitted a positive finding that the appellant posed a
    significant risk to the public.  Put differently, the Review Board was obliged
    to grant an absolute discharge if it was uncertain whether the appellant
    reached the significant threat threshold:  <i>Winko</i> at paras. 62, 70.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think that the uncertain opinion of Dr. Ellis could reasonably
    bear the burden of a finding that the appellant posed a significant risk to the
    public.  There was nothing else in the record to support that conclusion. 
    Neither the appellant’s psychiatric history, nor the nature of the index
    offences suggest a significant likelihood of physical violence.<a href="#_ftn3"

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the totality of this record does not reasonably

  <p class=HeadingNumber>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Review Board and
    direct an absolute discharge.  In doing so, I recognize that this may well not
    be in the appellant’s best interests.  The Review Board is, however, absent a reasonable
    finding of significant threat, not constitutionally permitted to impose
    limitations on the appellant’s liberty even though they may be in the
    appellant’s best interests.    </p>
