  <h3>I.         INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with arson and second degree murder.  He
    pleaded guilty to the arson charge and not guilty to the charge of second
    degree murder.  In a trial by jury, he advanced a defence of provocation to the
    murder charge.  The jury found him not guilty of second degree murder but
    guilty of the included offence of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was sentenced to a total of 10 years in the penitentiary
    for the manslaughter conviction with credit for 19 months of pre-sentence custody
    on a two for one basis.  He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment for the
    arson conviction to be served concurrently with the manslaughter sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his manslaughter sentence on the ground that the
    trial judge erred in imposing a sentence in excess of the lower end of the
    range for this kind of offence.  He also appeals the trial judge’s calculation
    of his credit for pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in the calculation of the
    pre-sentence custody credit.</p>
  <h3>II.        THE FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the victim, Deborah Devine, lived in a common-law
    relationship for 11 years.  At the time of the incident giving rise to this
    case, they were living in London, Ontario.  According to his statement to the
    police and his testimony at trial, the appellant said that on the evening of
    June 1, 2006 Ms. Devine and he were engaged in an argument in which she taunted
    him about his poor sexual performance and declared that she was going to bring
    home another man who could satisfy her sexual needs.  She suggested that the
    appellant could listen to them having sex.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant said that he became enraged and grabbed Ms. Devine around
    the neck and choked her for about five minutes until he realized that she was
    unconscious and dropped her on the bed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant panicked and poured cans of flammable fluid around the
    house from the basement to the main floor and set the house on fire.  He jumped
    out of a second storey window and fled the scene.  He walked towards nearby
    train tracks, with the thought of perhaps killing himself.  However, he changed
    his mind and made his way by foot to the Victoria Hospital about one mile
    away.  He was approached by a police officer near the hospital.  He told the
    police officer, “I think that I just killed my wife, then set fire to my
    house.”  The appellant was treated in the hospital for a broken foot and then
    taken to the police station.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The body of Ms. Devine was badly burned in the fire.  Her face was
    unrecognizable.  Her dental records were used to identify her.  The post-mortem
    examination suggested that she died before the start of the fire, as there was
    no soot in her lungs.</p>
  <h3>III.      THE REASONS FOR SENTENCE OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the jury accepted, as she did, that the
    appellant “was provoked during an altercation with Ms. Devine causing him to
    lose control; he strangled Ms. Devine with his hands.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering sentence, the trial judge observed that this was a
    difficult case because the appellant was a “gentle giant, and his actions that
    night were completely out of character.”  She also recognized that Ms. Devine’s
    taunting words to the appellant were devastating “and went beyond a repudiation
    of their relationship.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge began by considering the need for general and specific
    deterrence and the need for the appellant’s rehabilitation in fixing the
    appropriate sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then considered a number of aggravating factors in
    respect of the manslaughter conviction: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)     this
    was a domestic homicide;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)    the
    act was one of extreme violence over a period of approximately 5 minutes;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)   the
    victim was particularly vulnerable due to her small stature, particularly in
    contrast to the size of the appellant; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)   the
    appellant disregarded the lifeless body of Ms. Devine as he set fire to the
    house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also considered the following mitigating factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the appellant had been a devoted partner of Ms. Devine;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the appellant expressed remorse, although based on the report of a
    psychiatrist, the trial judge was left with the impression that the appellant
    was somewhat lacking in insight and may have perceived himself as a victim;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appellant is a “gentle giant”, as is indicated in the many letters attesting to
    his kind and gentle disposition;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appellant is an extremely hard-worker and a valued employee;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the appellant has a dated and irrelevant criminal record; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appellant pleaded guilty to arson and prior to trial offered to plead guilty to
    manslaughter, although the offer was rejected by the Crown.</p>
  <h3>IV.      THE APPEAL</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the argument before us, both the appellant and the respondent agreed
    that the range of sentence for manslaughter with aggravating circumstances,
    such as exist here, is 7 to 12 years.  The issue raised by the appellant is
    where on that scale the appellant stands.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the circumstances, which would
    have called for a sentence in the upper end of the range, were not present in
    this case: there was no history of abuse by the appellant; there was no
    significant or relevant criminal record; the appellant clearly expressed his
    remorse and accepted full responsibility for his conduct; and, a report from a
    psychiatrist indicated that the appellant was at low risk to re-offend. 
    Counsel further submits that the defence of provocation, which reduced the
    verdict from second degree murder to manslaughter is a significant mitigating
    factor in assessing the appellant’s moral blameworthiness and in determining an
    appropriate sentence.  See <i>R. v. Stone</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, at para.
    237.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant argues that, given the significant mitigating
    factors, the trial judge erred in imposing a sentence substantially in excess
    of the lower end of the 7 to 12 year range.  Counsel submits that the
    appropriate sentence for the manslaughter conviction is 8 or 9 years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the trial judge’s observation that this is a difficult case
    to determine the appropriate sentence for the appellant.  Obviously a delicate
    balancing of the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors is called for.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our task at the appellate level was succinctly described by Iacobucci J.
    in the often cited case of <i>R. v. Shropshire</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at
    para. 46:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An appellate court should not be given free reign
    to modify a sentencing order simply because it feels that a different order
    ought to have been made.  The formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly
    subjective process; the trial judge has the advantage of having seen and heard
    all of the witnesses whereas the appellate court can only base itself upon a
    written record.  A variation in the sentence should only be made if the court
    of appeal is convinced it is not fit.  That is to say, that it has found the
    sentence to be clearly unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the 10 year sentence, and in spite of Mr. Sheppard’s able
    argument, I am not able to conclude that the sentence is clearly unreasonable. 
    The trial judge considered all of the relevant factors, both for and against
    the appellant, as well as the need to pay heed to the principles of
    denunciation and deterrence in respect of crimes of domestic violence.  The
    aggravating considerations (referred to at paragraph 12) justified the trial
    judge’s decision to impose a sentence in the middle of the range.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the calculation of the pre-sentence custody credit. 
    Counsel for the Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in calculating the
    credit at 19 months.  The trial judge failed to account for time spent in
    custody post-conviction and before sentence, which is an additional 3 ½ months.  </p>
  <h3>V.        DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would grant leave to appeal.  I would allow the appeal only to the
    extent of granting a pre-sentence custody credit of 45 months (22 ½ months at 2
    for 1) and thereby reducing the net sentence to 6 years and 3 months.</p>
