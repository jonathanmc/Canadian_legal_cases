  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.           Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General of Canada supported by the
    Attorney General of Ontario moves for a stay of the judgment of Himel J. of
    September 28, 2010 concerning three provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that prohibit various types of conduct associated
    with prostitution.  The application judge
    found s. 210 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as
    it relates to prostitution to be unconstitutional.  She therefore struck the word “prostitution”
    from the definition of common bawdy-house in s. 197(1).  She also declared ss. 212(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>j)
    and 213(1)(c) to be unconstitutional and struck down those provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the judgment is to strike down the common
    bawdy-house provisions of the <i>Code</i> as
    they apply to prostitution, the living on the avails of adult prostitution offence,
    and the communicating for the purpose of prostitution offence.  The judgment leaves intact a large number of
    other provisions that touch on prostitution such as provisions prohibiting procuring,
    living on the avails of prostitution of a person under the age of 18 years and bawdy-house
    provisions relating to acts of indecency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge stayed her judgment until
    November 27, 2010.  On November 22, at
    the conclusion of argument of this motion I continued the stay until I released
    my decision on this motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fundamental submission of the moving party and the
    Attorney General of Ontario on this motion is that the judgment creates a
    legislative void that has profound implications for the public interest.  They argue that the judgment should be stayed
    until this court can conduct a full review of the decision.  The responding parties submit that the
    government evidence of harm to the public interest if a stay is not imposed is
    speculative.  Counsel submits that only
    after the judgment has been in place for some time will it be possible to
    measure the impact; in effect, the motion is premature and the court should
    wait and see what happen.  Further, the responding
    parties submit that there would be substantial harm if the judgment is stayed
    because to do so would perpetuate the law’s contribution to violence against a
    vulnerable population.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I am satisfied that it is in
    the public interest that the judgment be stayed for a relatively short period
    to permit appellate review of the decision. Accordingly, the judgment will be
    further stayed until April 29, 2011.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        Role of
    the Motion Judge and the <i>RJR-MacDonald</i> Test</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 135 of her reasons, the application judge made
    the important point that the evidence before her supported “the notion that
    prostitution is an intractable social problem” and that there is “disagreement
    about the proper legislative approach to prostitution”.  It is not the role of the courts to either
    solve that problem or fashion the appropriate legislation; that is the realm of
    Parliament, the legislatures, municipal governments and social agencies.  As the application judge said at para. 25, it
    was not her role to decide what policy model is better.  She recognized her duty was to determine
    whether the legislative scheme met minimum constitutional standards.  She found that it did not and it will be for
    this court to determine whether she was correct.  My role is more modest.  I must determine, by applying a test laid
    down by the Supreme Court of Canada, whether the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained pending the relatively short time
    it will take to review the decision in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It bears special emphasis that my perspective in
    deciding this motion is very different from that of the application judge.  This different perspective explains in part
    why despite the concerns expressed by the application judge, I have decided
    that a temporary stay of the judgment is required.  In particular, the Supreme Court of Canada
    has warned against a judge, hearing a stay motion, attempting to ascertain
    whether actual harm will result from the stay.  In <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada
    (AG),</i> [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at p. 346, the court pointed out that to do so </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>would</span> in effect require judicial
    inquiry into whether the government is governing well, since it implies the
    possibility that the government action does not have the effect of promoting
    the public interest and that the restraint of the action would therefore not
    harm the public interest. The <i>Charter</i> does not give the courts a licence to evaluate the effectiveness of government
    action, but only to restrain it where it encroaches upon fundamental rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One further point to note regarding this motion is that
    I am not sitting in appeal of the application judge’s decision not to suspend
    the declaration of invalidity.  She gave
    very careful consideration to this issue at paras. 508 to 535 of her
    reasons.  In making her determination she
    was bound by decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada and in particular <i>Schachter v. Canada</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R.
    679, to which she made extensive reference.  As she pointed out at para. 511, the Supreme Court has considered a
    suspension of invalidity to be a “serious matter” from the point of view of
    enforcement of the <i>Charter.  </i>The perspective of the application judge
    is driven by that context.  I am bound by
    a different body of law and by a different test, the test enunciated in <i>RJR-MacDonald, </i>where the context is the <i>prima facie</i> right of the government to a
    full review of the first-level decision and, as I will explain, the presumption
    of irreparable harm if the judgment is not stayed pending that review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for granting a stay pending appeal is set down
    in <i>RJR-MacDonald</i>.  The court must be satisfied that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        There
    is a serious issue to be tried;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       The party seeking the stay would suffer
    irreparable harm should the stay not be granted; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     The balance of convenience and public
    interest considerations favour a stay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The first part of the test has
    been satisfied; it is not disputed by the respondents that the issue before the
    court is a serious issue. The focus of the analysis will be on stages two and
    three of the <i>RJR-MacDonald</i> test.  </span>In cases involving the
    constitutionality of legislation, irreparable harm and balance of convenience
    tend to blend together and they are often considered together.  This blending of the two stages in cases
    involving the constitutionality of legislation is understandable because the
    public interest is engaged at both stages: <i>RJR-MacDonald,</i> at p. 349.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>RJR-MacDonald</i> instructs a motion judge that, in <i>Charter</i> cases, the onus of demonstrating irreparable harm to the public interest is
    less on a public authority than on a private applicant: p. 346.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'> At the balance of convenience stage, I must
    determine which of the two parties will suffer the greater harm from the
    granting or refusal of the stay:<i> RJR-MacDonald</i> at p.&nbsp;342.  In
    constitutional cases, the public interest is a “special factor” that must be
    considered in assessing where the balance of convenience lies: p. 343.  As I will explain more fully below, while the
    Attorney General does not have a monopoly on the public interest,  a private party relying on the public interest
    to justify continuing suspension of legislation must, at the balance of
    convenience stage, demonstrate that the “suspension of the legislation would
    itself provide a public benefit”: <i>RJR-MacDonald</i> at p. 349. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, unlike the application judge, I must
    determine whether a stay should be granted in a context where (1) there is a<i> prima facie</i> right of the government to
    a full review of the first-level decision; (2) the government has a presumption
    of irreparable harm if the judgment is not stayed pending that review; and (3)
    the responding parties must demonstrate that<span style='color:black'> suspension of the legislation would provide a public benefit to tip the public
    interest component of the balance of convenience in their favour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This application is particularly difficult because of
    the findings made by the application judge concerning the link between the
    impugned provisions and the violence suffered by prostitutes.  The application judge found that the
    applicants had established that there are ways in which the risk of violence
    towards prostitutes can be reduced but that the impugned provisions throw up
    barriers, enforced by criminal sanction, that prevent prostitutes from taking
    measures that could reduce the risk of violence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are obvious advantages to maintaining the <i>status quo</i> by staying the judgment.  A stay will minimize public confusion about
    the state of the law in Ontario; for the time being the law in Ontario will be
    the same as in the rest of Canada.  The
    police will be able to continue to use the tools associated with enforcement of
    the law that they say provides some safety to prostitutes, especially those
    working on the streets.  The various
    levels of government will have the opportunity, should they choose to do so, to
    consider a legislative response to the judgment, which might be better informed
    following a full review by this court of the application judge’s decision.  Further, if a legislative response is
    required, sufficient time is needed because a response may be difficult to
    design not only because of the complexity of the issues surrounding prostitution
    but because of the uncertainty of the role of the province and municipalities
    in light of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Westendorp v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 43.  In that case, the court struck down a
    municipal by-law directed at control of street prostitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, maintaining the <i>status quo</i> will leave in place a legislative framework that the application
    judge found seriously impacts on the physical security of a group of people,
    mostly women, who are pursuing an occupation that is not <i>per se</i> illegal.  While it is
    not my task to review the correctness of the application judge’s decision, I
    cannot simply ignore those findings as they may inform the test for granting a
    stay.  I am also conscious of the
    application judge’s concern about staying the judgment as expressed at para. 2 of
    her reasons on October 15, 2010, granting a further temporary stay:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I expressed to counsel that I was concerned about
    extending the period of stay in light of my findings that the impugned provisions
    were being rarely enforced or were ineffective and that the law as it stands is
    currently contributing to danger faced by prostitutes. However, because all the
    parties consented and the extension was only for an additional thirty days, I
    am exercising my discretion and granting a stay of my judgement that the
    provisions are unconstitutional and should be of no force and effect, for an
    additional thirty days. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.       Decision
    Below</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge based her decision on a
    voluminous record.  In careful and
    lengthy reasons she found that the impugned provisions deprived the applicants
    of security of the person under s. 7 of the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  I
    will refer to more of the application judge’s reasons below.  But, in short, she found that prostitutes,
    especially street prostitutes, are vulnerable to acts of violence and the
    impugned provisions prevent them from taking precautions that can decrease the
    risk of violence.  She went on to find
    that the provisions deprive the applicants of their security of the person in a
    manner that is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental
    justice.  Finally, she found that the s.
    7 violations could not be saved under s. 1 of the <i>Charter.</i>  Additionally, the
    application judge found that s. 213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) violates
    freedom of expression under s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and was not a reasonable limit under s. 1.<span style='color:red'>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge dealt at length with the harm
    faced by prostitutes in Canada.  As she
    pointed out, most of the evidence of harm was in relation to street
    prostitutes.  She also considered whether
    violence is intrinsic to prostitution or whether there are ways to reduce the
    risk of harm.  She found that the risk of
    harm could be reduced.  This was the key
    finding in her reasons; because she then went on to find that enforcement of
    the impugned provisions prevents prostitutes from reducing the risk of
    harm.  This finding established the
    crucial causal link between state action and the infringement of sex-trade workers’
    security of the person.  The government
    had argued before the application judge that it was the clients who put
    prostitutes at risk, not the legislation.  The government attacks this finding of causality in their appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge then found that the infringement
    of the prostitutes’ security of the person was not in accordance with the
    principles of fundamental justice.  She
    began with the principle of fundamental justice that laws should not be
    arbitrary and found that s. 212(1)(j), living on the avails, is inconsistent
    with its objective of protecting prostitutes from exploitation and is therefore
    arbitrary.  She found that on their own
    the bawdy-house and communicating provisions were each not arbitrary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the application judge found that the bawdy-house
    provision, when acting in conjunction with the other impugned provisions, is
    arbitrary. She made the same finding with respect to the communicating
    provision.  The clearest case was in
    relation to the bawdy-house provision.  While
    the application judge determined that in-call work is the safest form of
    prostitution, it is rendered illegal.  While out-call work is legal, it is not as safe and the living on the
    avails provision prevents prostitutes from taking measures such as hiring a
    driver or security guard that would make out-call work safer.  The other alternative is street prostitution
    which the application judge found to be the most dangerous, especially because
    the communication prohibition forces prostitutes into brief encounters where
    they are unable to adequately assess risk:  see reasons of the application judge at para.&nbsp;385.  The application judge similarly found that
    the communicating provision, in conjunction with the other impugned provisions,
    was arbitrary since moving prostitutes off the streets to combat social
    nuisance may exacerbate the harm that the bawdy-house provision seeks to
    prevent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also considered the overbreadth
    principle of fundamental justice.  She
    found that the bawdy-house provision was overbroad because none of the harms
    the provision is aimed at, such as threats to public health or safety or
    eliminating neighbourhood disorder, need to be proved to obtain a
    conviction.  Similarly, the living on the
    avails prohibition was overbroad because it caught non-exploitative
    arrangements.  The communicating offence
    was not overbroad.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the application judge found that all three
    provisions are grossly disproportionate to their objectives and therefore
    violate the proportionality principle of fundamental justice.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no dispute at the hearing of this motion that
    the Attorney General has met the first part of the test.  These are serious questions, some of which
    have already been reviewed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), </i>[1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123<i> </i>[the <i>Prostitution Reference</i>].  In
    the <i>Prostitution</i> <i>Reference</i>, a majority of the court upheld the validity of s. 193
    (now s. 210) and s. 195.1(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) (now 213(1)(c))
    against challenges that those provisions infringe s. 7, albeit on different
    grounds than argued before the application judge. The majority also held that
    while the communication provision infringes s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, the violation is justifiable under s. 1<i>.</i>  In his notice of appeal, the Attorney General of
    Canada submits, among other things, that the trial judge erred in failing to
    follow the <i>Prostitution Reference</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        Review of Evidence
    as it relates to Public Interest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The real issues on this motion concern the second and
    third parts of the <i>RJR-MacDonald </i>test
    and particularly the third part, the balance of convenience.  In cases involving the constitutionality of
    legislation, irreparable harm and balance of convenience tend to blend together
    and they are often considered together.  See for example, <i>Horsefield v.
    Ontario (Registrar of Motor Vehicles)</i> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 304 at p. 311.  This blending of the two stages in cases
    involving the constitutionality of legislation is understandable because, where
    the government is the <span class=GramE>applicant,</span> the public interest
    is engaged at both stages:  <i>RJR-MacDonald,</i> at p. 349.  As well, the irreparable harm is not easily
    quantified in a case such as this in which monetary issues are not engaged and
    any harm to one side or the other cannot be cured by an award of damages at the
    end of the litigation:  <i>RJR-MacDonald,</i> at p. 341.  In the result, the same considerations that
    concern a court at the irreparable harm stage resurface in the balance of
    convenience stage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The focus of the government evidence on this
    application is the impact of a legislative void if the police are deprived of
    the power to investigate the impugned offences.  Most of the evidence concerned the impact of the inability to enforce
    s.&nbsp;213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c), the communicating provision.  To their credit, the police affiants
    generally make relatively modest claims about the effectiveness of s. 213(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c).  The Attorneys
    General also filed material directed to the harm to the public interest resulting
    from failure to grant a stay in relation to the living on the avails and
    bawdy-house provisions, and the overall impact of the invalidity of all three
    of the impugned provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before dealing with these two stages, I will set out
    the objectives of the impugned legislation as identified by the application
    judge, as a means of setting the context for this motion.  I will then summarize the evidence that the
    parties adduced, evidence directed to the issues of irreparable harm and
    balance of convenience and particularly to the question of properly identifying
    and situating the public interest.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her reasons, the application judge considered the
    objectives of the impugned legislation at length.  Adopting the view of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in the <i>Prostitution Reference,</i> the application judge found at para. 274, that the objective of s.&nbsp;213(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c), communicating for the purpose of prostitution, is to
    “address solicitation in public places and, to that end, seeks to eradicate the
    various forms of social nuisance arising from the public display of the sale of
    sex” and to take “solicitation for the purposes of prostitution off the streets
    and out of public view”.  In the <i>Prostitution Reference,</i> pp.&nbsp;1134-35,
    a majority of the Supreme Court found that the eradication of nuisance-related
    problems caused by street solicitation was a pressing and substantial concern.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Staff Sergeant Randy Cowan is a member of the Peel
    Regional Police with 25 years experience as a police officer including 5 years
    as the Coordinator of the Vice Unit.  He
    concedes that street prostitution “continues to be widespread in Peel
    Region”.  The police respond to
    complaints by citizens through so-called “john sweeps” in which the police
    “rely heavily on the ability to lay charges under s. 213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>”.  After a sweep, there is a noticeable drop in
    street prostitution.  He does not say in
    his affidavit how long the drop in street prostitution lasts.  Further, while on the one hand he says that
    prostitutes and johns are deterred from returning to the area, he also concedes
    that “this activity continues in these areas despite this section being in
    force”.  Still, the police rely on s.
    213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) as a means of deterring the worst excesses
    of public solicitation.  He said the
    following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With this section of the <i>Criminal Code</i> intact, the john and the prostitute are forced to
    keep their activity as undetected as possible, yet as it stands we still
    receive complaints from residents regarding their activity.  Without this section there would be no
    deterrent.  This could lead to johns and
    prostitutes becoming more overt in their activity and thus becoming more of a
    community problem, with the police powerless to intervene because their
    activity is no longer unlawful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are several important points to observe from this
    key passage of Staff Sergeant Cowan’s affidavit.  First, the application judge found that the
    communicating provision forces prostitutes and their customers to conduct their
    negotiations in a manner that is least likely to be detected.  The evidence referred to by the application
    judge shows that it is this very fact that leads to the greater risk of harm to
    prostitutes, since they have less time to assess the potential dangerousness of
    the client.  As well, these sweeps may force
    prostitutes into more isolated and dangerous areas.  The application judge quotes at length from
    the government’s own reports to support this premise.  For example, according to the application
    judge, the 1998 <i>Report of the Federal,
    Provincial and Territorial Deputy Ministers Working Group on Prostitution</i> found that the legislation has not had a serious impact on controlling street
    prostitution: para. 161 of her reasons.  The 1998 <i>Working Group Report</i> also referred to research that “suggests that the illegal status of
    prostitution activities, especially those that occur in public or on the
    street, has contributed to a large amount of violence”: see para. 330.  To a similar effect is the 2006 <i>Report of the House of Commons Standing
    Committee on Justice and Human Rights Subcommittee on Solicitation Laws</i>.  The application judge quoted from this report
    at para. 331 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In many of the cities we visited, a number of
    witnesses indicated that the enforcement of section 213 forced street
    prostitution activities into isolated areas, where they asserted that the risk
    of abuse and violence is very high. <i>These
    witnesses told us that by forcing people to work in secrecy, far from
    protection services, and by allowing clients complete anonymity, section 213
    endangers those who are already very vulnerable selling sexual service on the
    street</i>. ...</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>...</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>During our hearings, a number of witnesses
    maintained that the introduction of the communicating law (section 213) also
    led to the scattering of prostitutes, making them more vulnerable to violence
    and exploitation. Whereas in the past street prostitutes frequently worked in
    teams in an effort to reduce the risk of violence (for example by helping take
    down information such as clients' licence plate numbers and descriptions), they
    now tend to work in isolation from one another. <i>While this practice has the advantage of attracting less attention from
    police, it also minimizes information-sharing, making prostitutes more
    vulnerable to meeting violent clients since they are not as well informed and
    are often less aware of the resources available to assist them.</i></p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>...</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>According to
    a number of witnesses, section 213 also places street prostitutes in danger by
    forcing them to conclude their negotiations with clients more quickly, often
    leading them to get into the client's car too quickly.</i> ...</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>...</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Working out the details of the transaction before
    getting into a vehicle or going to a private location was considered important
    by all the prostitutes who testified. They told us that public bargaining would
    give them an opportunity to assess the likelihood of a potential client having
    violent tendencies.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Staff Sergeant Cowan also stated that the police use s.
    213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) to help prostitutes, whom they view as
    victims.  He says that the possibility of
    laying charges allows the police to detain prostitutes for investigation and in
    this way “keep track of them, gain their trust, and sometimes help them get out
    of prostitution”.  He says that:  “[w]ithout a statutory authority or purpose
    to engage persons involved in this activity, police activity could and would be
    construed as harassment”.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Staff Sergeant Cowan also referred to the
    AVERT initiative to “monitor street prostitutes and guard against anonymous
    victimization and undetected foul play”.  The database associated with this initiative contains the profile of 24
    women.  The program allows the police to
    assist women in overcoming their drug addictions and in exiting
    prostitution.  Staff Sergeant Cowan asserts
    that without s. 213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) there would be no AVERT
    program and no ability to take proactive measures to assist prostitutes, or to
    search for them if they go missing resulting in a “reduced ability to protect
    prostitutes from violence”.  I did not
    find this statement particularly compelling.  In particular, I fail to see the link between s.&nbsp;213(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>c) and the ability to search for missing people.  And, counsel for the responding parties makes
    the point that this “compassionate enforcement” only benefits a small group of
    sex workers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More compelling is Staff Sergeant Cowan’s evidence
    concerning the use of s.&nbsp;213(1)(c) to reduce public solicitation in
    residential neighbourhoods and the associated problems identified by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in the <i>Prostitution
    Reference</i>.  Staff Sergeant Cowan’s
    evidence in this respect is supported by the evidence from members of the
    Parkdale Community in Toronto and the Hintonburg community near Ottawa.  These community members speak eloquently of
    the impact of street prostitution, which is often associated with drug use, on
    the quality of life in those communities.  Finally, Staff Sergeant Cowan speaks of the possible increase in street
    prostitution in Ontario and more frequent confrontations between prostitutes
    and members of the public, should the judgment not be stayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The possible impact on the Hintonburg community of the
    invalidity of s. 213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) is explained by the
    community member in her affidavit.  While
    she speaks of the impact of the invalidity of all of the impugned provisions, a
    close examination of her affidavit shows that it is the inability to enforce s.
    213(1)(c) that would have the greatest impact on the community:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>None of the alternatives to the prostitution laws
    would work.  Legalizing would not stop
    the illegal sex trade.  A lot of johns
    want anonymity and visiting a brothel is not anonymous; their car is parked
    there.  In contrast, street prostitution
    takes <span class=GramE>minutes,</span> it’s anonymous and only costs $10.  Also the drug-addicted women could not work
    in brothels; neither could the ones who have STDs. … In addition, the
    prostitutes in my neighbourhood were generally older (30-55 years of age) and
    most were drug-addicted.  These are not
    the kind of women would could get work in a brothel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence provided in the affidavit of Inspector
    Howard Page of the Toronto Police Service is similar to that of Staff Sergeant
    Cowan.  He also makes the somewhat
    broader statement that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 213(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) is also
    one of the most effective tools the police have to investigate pimps and the
    exploitation of women within the sex trade.  Information on pimps and related organized crime would often not come to
    light if arrests were not made for communicating for the purpose of
    prostitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>While Inspector
    Page referred to no empirical data to support this rather bold claim, since the
    responding parties chose not to cross-examine him on his affidavit, the
    statement stands unchallenged on this motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General of Ontario provided two affidavits
    from Derek Parenteau who is employed as a Street Youth Worker at Evergreen
    Centre for Street Youth in Toronto.  Through a drop-in centre operated by the Evergreen Centre, Mr. Parenteau
    has had contact with many pimps and prostitutes.  While I found his information interesting it
    was difficult to draw any helpful inferences from it.  If nothing else, Mr. Parenteau’s affidavits
    demonstrate the complexity of the treatment of prostitution by the law.  His first affidavit is a summary of brief
    conversations he has had with pimps and prostitutes since the application judge
    rendered her decision.  They have told
    him that there will be an increase in street prostitution, including
    prostitution by underage girls.  He also
    provided the opinion that the average age of entry into prostitution for girls
    is 13 to 14 years and for boys is 12 to 13 years.  It is difficult to know <span class=GramE>what
    conclusions to draw from this kind of information; the criminal prohibitions
    relating to living on the avails of prostitutes under the age of 18 years have
    not been not struck down,</span> and the alleged involvement of underage youth
    in prostitution was obviously the state of affairs well before the application
    judge’s decision.  Finally, the pimps
    have also told Mr. Parenteau that they fear organized crime will become more
    involved in street prostitution.  This
    statement is pure speculation from unnamed sources whose qualifications to make
    the observations are unknown.  I give it
    no weight. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General of Canada also filed an affidavit
    from John Fenn who runs a diversion program in Toronto for persons charged with
    the communicating offence and being found in a bawdy-house.  He attests to the success of this program,
    so-called “John Schools” in Toronto and elsewhere.  He feels that these programs as well as a
    program to assist prostitutes called “Streetlight” will fold if the judgment of
    the application judge is not stayed because these programs are funded by fees
    charged to the accused for attending the school.  I would point out that the evidence given by
    Natashe Falle, who actually manages the Streetlight program, was to the effect
    that even without the support from fees charged to accused, there would be “a
    lot of other avenues” for funding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fenn also offered the opinion that previous
    graduates will return to purchasing the services of prostitutes, that there
    will be more prostitutes in communities and that pimps will try to lure more
    women, and younger girls into prostitution.  He also said, “It will be very difficult to reverse the harms
    done.”  It is not clear to me that Mr.
    Fenn had the required expertise to offer these latter opinions and accordingly,
    I have attached no weight to these bald claims unsupported by any empirical or
    other data.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Staff Sergeant Cowan and Inspector Page filed
    affidavits before the application judge and those affidavits were also filed on
    this application.  The application judge
    did not expressly refer to those affidavits, but she did refer generally to the
    evidence of police officers filed by the Attorney General of Canada at paras.
    89 to 94 of her reasons.  She noted at
    para. 94 that those officers who were cross-examined “admitted that the level
    of violence faced by prostitutes on the streets is worse than it is indoors,
    and that safety precautions can be taken in indoor locations to reduce the
    level of violence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude, the Attorneys General have provided, on
    this motion, evidence of harm to the public interest, should the judgment not
    be stayed in relation to s. 213(1)(c). Admittedly, some of that evidence is
    less than compelling, for reasons I have provided.  I will consider the impact of that evidence
    below in applying the irreparable harm and balance of convenience parts of the
    test.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(ii)  Section 210 – Bawdy-house provision</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            1.         <i>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found, based on the historical
    record, that the objectives of the bawdy-house provisions (ss. 197 and 210), as
    they relate to prostitution, are to combat neighbourhood disruption or disorder,
    and to safeguard public health and safety.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the Attorney General of
    Ontario’s broader or “modern” objective based on a “concern for the dignity of
    persons involved in prostitution and the prevention of physical and
    psychological harm to them”.  Even if
    this was an objective of the legislation, the evidence placed before the
    application judge made her doubt the effectiveness of the legislation in
    meeting that objective.  The application
    judge found, at para. 361, that with respect to the bawdy-house provision, “the
    evidence suggests that working in-call is the safest way to sell sex; yet,
    prostitutes who attempt to increase their level of safety by working in-call
    face criminal sanction”.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            2.         <i>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In para. 539 of her reasons, the application judge
    recognized that a consequence of holding the provisions unconstitutional “may
    be that unlicensed brothels may be operated and in a way that may not be in the
    public interest”.  She stayed her
    decision for up to 30 days to enable the parties to make fuller submissions on
    whether her decision should be stayed.  As noted, the parties subsequently agreed to a further stay pending this
    motion.  The Attorneys General did not
    attempt to place evidence before the application judge despite her invitation
    to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The evidence of
    Staff Sergeant Cowan and Inspector Page provided on this motion is not so much
    directed to the question of the impact of operation of unlicensed brothels (the
    question raised by the application judge).  Rather, their evidence was directed to the impact of the declaration of
    invalidity of the bawdy-house provision on the ability to investigate other
    offences.  As I understand the import of
    most of this evidence, while there was some nuisance associated with the
    operation of bawdy-houses, the bawdy-house provision was most useful as a way
    to leverage investigations to uncover more serious criminal activities.  Staff Sergeant Cowan described the
    bawdy-house investigations as “multi-layered”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The first layer that often presents itself is the
    street level or bawdy-house layer, which begins with a complaint or discovery
    that a place is operating as a house of prostitution.  This causes the police [to] begin an
    investigation regarding bawdy-houses.  In
    the course of this investigation other layers become visible.  These are usually more serious, and thus the
    effort to conceal them is greater.  These
    layers are the human trafficking, extortions, assaults, threatening,
    exploitation and procuring layers.  These
    investigations initially present as bawdy-house, communication for the purpose
    or living on the avails.  If the police
    were no longer to have the legislated mandate to enforce those laws, then these
    very serious crimes would go undetected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge reviewed in her reasons at paras.
    514 to 535 the many other <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions that, in her <span class=GramE>view,</span> would be available to
    investigate these other offences.  Staff
    Sergeant Cowan explains in his affidavit filed on this motion why many of these
    provisions would not be as effective as the bawdy-house investigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inspector Page gave similar evidence as that of Staff Sergeant
    Cowan.  Unfortunately, for the applicant,
    the cogency of his assertions is undermined by the example he provided as to
    the supposed utility of the bawdy-house provisions.  At paras. 14 to 17 of his affidavit,
    Inspector Page discusses a case reported in the Toronto Star in September of
    this year which he alleged came to light through a bawdy-house investigation,
    where  a prostitute complained to police
    that she was being subjected to extortion.  Inspector Page goes on to describe how “a couple of months later” the
    investigating officers noticed that these same premises, which were offering
    escort services through Craigslist, were being used for babysitting young
    children.   Inspector Page goes on to
    make the claim that, “[n]one of this <span class=GramE>activity</span> would
    have been discovered in the absence of the bawdy-house investigation.”  Counsel for the responding parties made the
    point that this investigation could have been undertaken in view of the
    complaint of the criminal offence of extortion and the apparent commission of
    the corrupting children offences contrary to s. 172 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Although
    counsel for the responding parties chose not to cross-examine Inspector Page, I
    attach little weight to his assertions concerning the operation of s. 210.  The lack of empirical evidence and the
    frailty of his anecdotal evidence leave me unconvinced on this aspect of
    Inspector Page’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inspector Page goes on to assert that, “[i]n many
    instances, s. 210 is the only effective tool which law enforcement officers
    have to uncover human trafficking and links to organized crime”.  Inspector Page also says that the provision
    provides a mechanism for seizing the proceeds of crime.  He provides no empirical data or even
    anecdotal evidence to support these assertions.  Finally, he asserts that bawdy-houses would be free to operate in
    residential areas “providing venues for organized crime, pimps, drug
    traffickers and the exploitation of vulnerable women and youth”.  This assertion suffers to some extent from
    the failure to explain, in particular, why the drug laws do not provide
    adequate enforcement mechanisms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The information provided by Staff Sergeant Cowan and
    Inspector Page are supported by the affidavits of two community members.  However, the affiant from Parkdale appears to
    associate the harm caused by a proliferation of bawdy-houses with their use as
    “crack houses”.  It is unclear why drug
    enforcement legislation is incapable of coping with this problem.  Indeed, the affiant from Hintonburg makes
    this point in her affidavit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition to the work of the police, in
    particular, the prostitution sweeps, <i>the
    decrease in prostitution occurred in part because the community was able to get
    rid of the really active drug houses, the crack-houses</i>.  As well, with urban renewal, the run-down
    houses in our neighbourhood have been torn down and rebuilt, and there are
    fewer drug houses.  In the past year or
    so, prostitution has moved away, along with the drug trade. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hintonburg neighbourhood association formed a
    taskforce whereby community groups shared concerns regarding drugs and
    prostitution with various city departments. There did not appear to be any
    association between the bawdy-house provision and this community initiative.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Staff Sergeant Cowan and Inspector Page deal at some
    length with the regulation of strip clubs.  According to Staff Sergeant Cowan there is “already a large problem with
    strip club owners and massage parlour owners being wilfully blind to the
    prostitution occurring in their clubs”.  It is unclear what inference is to be drawn from this information,
    except that there may be more prostitution in these clubs.  Paradoxically, Detective Constable Balaga, of
    the Toronto Police Service, who provided an affidavit for the Attorney General
    of Ontario, offered the opinion that the application judge’s decision would
    lead to the closing down of strip clubs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standing against the government evidence on this motion
    is the wealth of information before the application judge about the safety
    advantages of indoor prostitution. <span style='line-height:200%'>At para. 305, she referred to the finding of the 1998 <i>Working Group Report</i></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Available data tends to demonstrate that indoor
    prostitution is less harmful physically than that which takes place on the
    street. The vast majority of crimes against prostitutes, including murders, are
    perpetrated against street prostitutes by customers and pimps, largely because
    of the anonymity, tension and high level of drug use that characterize street
    prostitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, at para. 306, the 2006 <i>Subcommittee Report</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Much less is known about violence against people
    involved in off-street prostitution. As we have seen, these people are often
    invisible to conventional research, or at least more difficult to reach.
    However, according to witnesses, it would appear that off-street prostitutes
    are generally subject to less violence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interestingly, Staff Sergeant Cowan supports at least
    some form of indoor prostitution.  He
    said this at para. 27 of the affidavit placed before the application judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Under the
    Criminal Code, prostitution itself is not illegal.  There are legal, safe ways to practice
    prostitution in Canada.  I support this
    approach</i>, and believe it is preferable to the legal regime in some parts of
    the United States, where prostitution itself is illegal, and police spend a lot
    of their time going after prostitutes rather than the pimps. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada explained
    that the legal way to practice prostitution involved some form of advertising
    in which the customer and the prostitute make contact and then the prostitute
    goes to the customer’s hotel room or residence (so-called “out-call
    work”).  Staff Sergeant Cowan also went
    on in the same affidavit to offer the opinion, that “there would be a huge
    increase in prostitution in Canada” if the impugned provisions were struck down
    and that “Canada would become a sex tourism destination and the number of young
    women and girls caught up in prostitution would greatly increase”.  He made this claim in the face of his own opinion
    that the price of sexual services is already “much lower” than it is in the
    United States because of our “already relatively liberal prostitution laws” and
    that prostitution is “already a large industry among business travellers”. Even
    taking into account the difficulty of predicting the impact of
    decriminalization of bawdy-houses, I find this part of Staff Sergeant Cowan’s
    affidavit too speculative to warrant giving it much weight.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General of Ontario relied in this
    application on the affidavit of Cecilia Benoit, who had been a witness for the
    responding parties before the application judge.  In the affidavit, Dr. Benoit refers to
    reports that sex-trade workers operating indoors experience fewer instances of
    violence and that those working independently in their own homes were able to
    retain most of their earnings.  The
    Attorney General of Ontario relied upon a portion of para. 23 of Dr. Benoit’s
    affidavit to highlight the importance of a regulatory framework.  The complete paragraph is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Sex workers operating out of their own homes are
    also not immune to the threat of violence, as one respondent commented:  “I had one trick threaten to kill me when I
    was working out of my home.”  These
    violent episodes, however, occur with far greater frequency and severity on the
    outdoor strip.  It is therefore not
    solely the nature of the profession, but also the nature of the venue, that
    makes women susceptible to violence under the current laws.  <i>In
    order to maximize the safety of sex workers it is not sufficient to simply
    repeal bawdyhouse prohibitions, as this repeal must be complimented or
    accompanied by a rational regulatory regime.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Benoit’s report, <i>Dispelling Myths and Understanding Realities: Working Conditions, Health
    Status, and Exiting Experiences of Sex Workers</i>, was also relied upon by the
    Attorney General of Ontario for the evidence that some bawdy-houses operate
    like sweatshops where the workers are vulnerable to economic exploitation by
    those in positions of control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The Attorney
    General of Ontario also relied upon portions of the transcript of the
    cross-examination of Dr. Frances Shaver that was before the application
    judge.  These excerpts support the view
    that decriminalization alone will not ensure the safety of prostitutes.  For example, Dr. Shaver agreed with this
    statement from a report she wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Legislative review is one area in need of
    attention.  <i>Legislative change in and of itself, however, will not be sufficient to
    improve the situation for sex workers</i>.  Such changes must be combined with social policy changes, including
    education, support and advocacy, as other factors (e.g., public attitudes and
    opinion; the stigma attached to sex work) also have a negative impact on sex
    workers’ lives. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, the application judge found that the safest
    way to conduct prostitution is generally in-call and noted that the bawdy-house
    provisions make this type of prostitution illegal. She made this finding on the
    basis of government and Parliamentary reports and the evidence of Dr. John
    Lowman, an expert who had prepared several reports on prostitution for the
    federal Department of Justice.  On this
    motion, however, I must consider the short-term impact of decriminalization, in
    the absence of any regulatory framework, since without a stay of the judgment,
    governments and social agencies would have little time to respond.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting the application judge’s identification of the
    harm from enforcement of the bawdy-house provision, I must also take into
    account that there is no evidence from the responding parties as to how, in the
    relatively short time before this appeal is heard, and in the absence of any
    regulatory regime, the safety of prostitutes will be measurably increased by
    suspending the bawdy-house provisions.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(iii)  Section 212(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>j) –
    Living on the avails</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            1.         <i>Objective
    of s. 212(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>j)</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found, at para. 259, that the
    objective of s. 212(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>j), the living on the avails of
    prostitution offence, “is aimed at preventing the exploitation of prostitutes
    and profiting from prostitution by pimps”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            2.         <i>The
    Legislative Void and s. 212(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>j)</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Staff Sergeant Cowan and Inspector Page provided some
    information on the impact of the striking down of s. 212(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>j).  Staff Sergeant Cowan states that this
    provision is used to investigate pimps who are exploiting girls and women.  He states that the police are able to
    prosecute this offence without the evidence of the prostitute, who is often
    unwilling to testify.  Also, these
    investigations may lead to the laying of human trafficking charges.  Staff Sergeant Cowan provided some
    information to substantiate this assertion.  Inspector Page provided similar evidence in his affidavit.  Mr. Parenteau offered the opinion that the
    living on the avails offence protects prostitutes from exploitation by pimps to
    an extent that other charges do not, apparently because the prostitute does not
    have to testify to support the charge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One concern raised by Staff Sergeant Cowan is the
    impact of what he termed the “open market” should the judgment not be
    stayed.  In his opinion, this open market
    would increase the demand for prostitutes and he noted that prostitutes are
    often recruited and exploited at a young age.  This opinion is, in some respects, merely an educated guess and I weigh
    its value accordingly.  The opinion is
    also somewhat at odds with the affidavit the officer filed before the
    application judge where he attests to the success in deterring juvenile prostitution.  However, I would not wholly discount this
    opinion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the living on the
    avails provision infringed the <i>Charter</i> rights of prostitutes and exposed them to risk of serious harm because, as
    interpreted by the courts, the provisions prevent prostitutes from taking steps
    to protect themselves such as allowing the prostitute to hire an assistant or
    bodyguard.  She went on to find that the
    provision, whose objective was to protect prostitutes from exploitation “may
    actually serve to increase the vulnerability and exploitation of the very group
    it intends to protect”:  para. 379.  The affidavits of the officers meet this
    issue to some extent by stating that, in their experience, charges are only
    laid in circumstances where the police believe there is evidence of exploitation.  </p>
  <h4> <span
class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>(iv)  The</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> Overall Impact of the Legislative Void </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Staff Sergeant Cowan and Inspector Page provided
    information on the overall impact of a declaration of invalidity with respect
    to all three provisions.  The general
    import of these parts of the affidavits was that the police would have to
    abandon all ongoing <span class=GramE>investigations, that</span> “red light
    districts” and street prostitution would proliferate, and that pimps and others
    would be free to exploit and victimize vulnerable women and children.  Staff Sergeant Cowan and Inspector Page also
    explained in some detail why investigations into offences under other
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> would
    not provide viable alternatives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Attorney General of Canada relies upon the
    experience during the period that lap-dancing appeared to be legal following
    the trial decision in <i>R. v. Mara</i>,
    [1994] O.J. No. 264 (Ont. Ct. J. (Prov. Div.)), rev’d (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 643
    (C.A.), aff’d in part [1997] 2 S.C.R. 639. The material shows that it was
    difficult for municipalities to respond to what was considered a public health
    problem as well as increased risk of violence and coercion of employees of
    strip clubs. The difficulties that ensued as a result of the trial decision in
    that case may have been attributable to the lengthy (17-month) delay between
    the trial decision and when the Crown appeal was heard by this court.  I am confident that there will not be that
    kind of delay in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I found some of the claims somewhat overblown,
    particularly the claim that “all” ongoing investigations would have to be
    abandoned, the unchallenged evidence from these experienced police officers as
    to the short term harm that would occur cannot be ignored.  This, it seems to me, is the strength of the
    governments’ claim on irreparable harm and balance of convenience.  The invalidity of the impugned provisions
    would leave unregulated an area of activity that is associated with serious
    potential short-term harm to communities.  Municipalities and provincial governments would not be able to quickly
    respond with a regulatory framework that would be necessary to address some of
    the harms that the application judge recognized in her reasons.  Further, as ineffective and perhaps counter-productive
    as some of the enforcement of the s. 213(1)(c) offence may be, it is unclear
    whether the police would be able to quickly develop lawful strategies to
    respond to the legitimate concerns of the public, like those identified by the
    community members from Parkdale and Hintonburg.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will now turn to parts two and three of the <i>RJR-MacDonald </i>test, dealing briefly first
    with the question of irreparable harm.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        Findings on
    Irreparable Harm</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant and the responding parties spent some
    time in argument about whether the government was entitled to a presumption of
    irreparable harm.  The concept of such a
    presumption “in most cases” was enunciated in <i>RJR-MacDonald</i>, where the court held as follows at p. 346:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case of a public authority, the onus of
    demonstrating irreparable harm to the public interest is less than that of a
    private applicant. This is partly a function of the nature of the public
    authority and partly a function of the action sought to be enjoined. <i>The test will nearly always be satisfied
    simply upon proof that the authority is charged with the duty of promoting or
    protecting the public interest and upon some indication that the impugned
    legislation, regulation, or activity was undertaken pursuant to that
    responsibility. Once these minimal requirements have been met, the court should
    in most cases assume that irreparable harm to the public interest would result
    from the restraint of that action</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts have held that this presumption is applicable
    even where a court has struck down the impugned legislation.  As Richard C.J. said in <i>Canadian Council for Refugees et al. v. Canada</i>, 2008 FCA 40, at
    para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not accept the respondents' contention that
    the presumption that the STCA Regulations are in the public interest has been
    displaced by the judgment of the Federal Court. This judgment is under appeal
    and the presumption of public interest remains pending complete constitutional
    review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Richard C.J. that the presumption that
    Parliament was acting in the public interest in enacting the impugned
    provisions remains, although the application judge has struck down the
    legislation.  The public interest is
    particularly engaged where criminal law is the focus of the challenge since
    criminal law is “designed to promote public peace, safety, order, health or
    other legitimate public purpose”:  <i>R. v. Malmo-Levine</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571
    at para. 74.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In enacting these provisions, Parliament was attempting
    to promote or protect the public interest and so <i>prima facie</i> the government is entitled to the <i>RJR-MacDonald </i>presumption of irreparable harm.  The responding parties argue, however, that
    the harm is not only not irreparable but also speculative and tentative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the presumption of irreparable harm to
    the public interest, the harm to which the Attorney General points, and which
    is supported by some evidence tendered on this motion, may be summarized as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Inability to protect vulnerable neighbourhoods
    from nuisance associated with street prostitution;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Inability to assist prostitutes through
    investigative detention of the s. 213(1)(c) offence;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Inability to continue the John School diversion
    programme;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Inability to use the bawdy-house provision to
    initiate “multi-layered” investigations into crimes against prostitutes such as
    human trafficking, extortion, assault, threatening, exploitation and procuring;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Inability to use living on the avails charges as
    a means of interrupting human trafficking and other serious criminal offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as noted, the Attorney General relies upon the
    lack of any regulation of prostitution-related conduct as a result of the <i>de facto</i> legalization of street
    prostitution, bawdy-houses and pimping.  The
    government argues that even if some decriminalization was seen as an
    appropriate response to the danger faced by prostitutes, governments at all
    levels need time to put a suitable regulatory framework in place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the moving party has satisfied the
    irreparable harm test.  While some of the
    evidence relied upon is somewhat speculative, that is the nature of the irreparable
    harm test in a case, like this, where the harm is not measured in monetary
    terms.  The responding parties argue that
    the Attorney General has not demonstrated any irreparable harm because the
    provisions are rarely enforced and there are other methods open to the police
    to achieve the objectives of the legislation.  They point to the long list of other <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provisions that the police could use to investigate
    prostitution-related crimes and to the evidence of other enforcement techniques
    that have been employed in the past.  Against this submission is the unchallenged evidence of two experienced
    police officers of the difficulties of using many of these other provisions and
    other enforcement techniques. Finally, as pointed out in <i>RJR-MacDonald, </i>at p. 341, the term “irreparable” refers to “the
    nature of the harm suffered rather than its magnitude”.  Much of the responding parties’ submissions
    are more directed to the magnitude of the harm, an issue that is better
    analyzed at the third stage, balance of convenience.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D.        Findings on
    Balance of Convenience</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While I have found that the Attorney General has
    met the test for irreparable harm, that finding does not determine the question
    of balance of convenience.<span style='color:red'> </span><span
style='color:black'>At this stage, I must determine which of the two parties
    will suffer the greater harm from the granting or refusal of the stay: <i>RJR-MacDonald</i> at p. 342. In
    constitutional cases, the public interest is a “special factor” that must be
    considered in assessing where the balance of convenience lies: p. 343.  The Attorney General does not have a monopoly
    on the public interest, and it is open to both parties to rely upon the
    considerations of the public interest, including concerns of identifiable
    groups. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Here, the responding
    parties are private parties. As pointed out in <i>RJR-Macdonald</i> at p. 344, a private party alleging that a public
    interest is at risk must demonstrate that harm because a private applicant is
    “normally” presumed to be pursuing their own interest. While the responding parties
    here also rely on the public interest, there is an element of private interest
    in this case; the three applicants before the application judge stated that
    they would like to work as prostitutes or conduct activity that may infringe
    the prostitution provisions free from criminal sanction: see evidence of Ms.
    Bedford summarized at para. 31 of the application judge’s reasons; Ms.
    Lebovitch at para. 36; and Ms. Scott at para. 43.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>In the context of a
    suspension case, a private applicant relying on public interest must, at the
    balance of convenience stage, demonstrate that the “suspension of the
    legislation would itself provide a public benefit”. However, because the
    government benefits from the presumption that it acts to promote the public
    interest, the “same principles would apply” where it is the government and not
    a private party that is the applicant: <i>RJR-MacDonald</i> at p. 349.  That is, it is for the
    private party to show that suspension of the legislation would provide a public
    benefit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the respondent relies, as an aspect of
    the public interest, upon the considerations of an identifiable group;
    prostitutes who operate within a legally ambiguous context in which their
    occupation is not <i>per se</i> criminal,
    but virtually every method for carrying on that occupation is prohibited.  Yet, as the application judge found, the
    impugned legislation regulating the occupation prevents prostitutes from taking
    relatively modest steps to increase their security.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the applicant has established that
    the balance of convenience favours staying the judgment in relation to
    communicating for the purpose of prostitution, the s. 213(1)(c) offence.  The evidence establishes that it is the
    short-term consequences of an inability to enforce this prohibition that will
    have the most deleterious impact on vulnerable communities such as Parkdale and
    Hintonburg. The nature and ability to implement a short-term<span
style='color:#00B0F0'>, </span>constitutional federal response, in light of the
    application judge’s findings and the complexity of the issues, is far from
    clear.  The experience with the
    lap-dancing case shows that municipalities will not be able to respond
    immediately to this gap in the legislative scheme.  Moreover, in light of the <i>Westendorp</i> case, it is not obvious how affected
    municipalities could legally respond to the nuisance that would return to their
    communities.  I also point out that the
    term “nuisance” masks the seriousness of the problem facing these communities
    because of the attendant social problems that are associated with street
    prostitution including increased violence, accosting of women and girls, and
    drug use.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I appreciate the compelling evidence placed before the
    application judge that street prostitution is the most dangerous form of
    prostitution and that the communicating provision contributes to the risk of
    harm.  The dreadful experience in
    Vancouver revealed by the <i>Pickton</i> case (see <i>R. v. Pickton, </i>2010 SCC 32)
    is a compelling reminder of the danger of street prostitution.  However, the police also say that they use
    the communicating provision to intervene to attempt to mitigate the harm. I
    repeat the point made earlier that on this kind of a motion, on the one hand, I
    have a limited right to review the impugned government action for
    effectiveness.  On the other hand, the
    responding parties have not provided sufficient evidence to show that the
    suspension of the legislation, in the absence of regulation and social programs,
    would itself provide a public benefit during the brief time that the judgment
    will be stayed pending the appeal.  The
    balance of convenience test is by definition a balancing and I have been
    persuaded that, on balance, the <i>status
    quo</i> is preferable as it relates to the communicating offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, I am satisfied that the declaration of invalidity
    of the living on the avails offence should be stayed.  The evidence of harm to the public interest if
    a stay were not granted is less extensive for this offence than it is for the
    communicating offence.  However, there is
    unchallenged<span style='color:#00B0F0'> </span>evidence filed on this motion
    that this provision is used by police to protect against exploitation and
    physical harm to prostitutes in a context in which other provisions are
    ineffective because they depend upon evidence from the prostitute.  As well, this provision is used to further
    investigations into the very serious offence of human trafficking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most serious problem with the living on the avails
    provision, identified by the application judge, is that it overshoots the mark
    by criminalizing non-exploitive relationships, thus potentially preventing
    prostitutes from employing people who could provide a measure of safety.  On the other hand, there is the evidence referred
    to earlier suggesting that, at least in the experience of the police officers
    who filed affidavits on this motion, police do not lay the living on the avails
    charge in the absence of evidence, which they believe shows an exploitive
    relationship.  Police charging practices
    may not be relevant to whether the legislation meets minimum constitutional
    standards, see <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1987] 1
    S.C.R. 1045 at p. 1078-79.  That evidence
    may, however, assist in measuring the magnitude of the short-term harm should
    the judgment be stayed. Further, the respondent put little evidence before me
    of the benefit of a temporary suspension in the context of a regulatory void.  Again, I highlight this point because I am
    bound by this consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General has also met the balance of
    convenience test as it applies to the bawdy-house provision.  Consideration of a stay in relation to the
    bawdy-house provision starkly demonstrates the different perspectives the
    application judge had to bring to bear as opposed to the perspective I must
    apply<span style='color:#00B0F0'> </span>on this motion.  For example, in finding that the bawdy-house
    provision infringed the proportionality principle of fundamental justice, the
    application judge’s focus, applying <i>Malmo-Levine,</i> was on whether the deprivation of security of the person was grossly
    disproportionate to its objective of preventing public nuisance and
    interference with public health and safety.  She found, based on the evidentiary <span class=GramE>record, that</span> complaints about nuisance are rare and that enforcement has the potential of
    preventing prostitutes from taking measures to enhance their health and safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as I have noted earlier, it is not the
    nuisance of bawdy-houses which represents the harm to the public interest upon
    which the government relies in its motion before me.  Rather, the government relies on the
    inability to use bawdy-house investigations to investigate other potentially
    much more serious offences involving exploitation of prostitutes.  The responding parties did not suggest that I
    could not consider this kind of harm to the public interest.  In any event, I am satisfied that <i>RJR-MacDonald</i> allows me to take into
    account these broader considerations, as the court explained at p. 344 of the
    reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is, we think, appropriate that it be open to
    both parties in an interlocutory <i>Charter</i> proceeding to rely upon considerations of the public interest. <i>Each party is entitled to make the court
    aware of the damage it might suffer prior to a decision on the merits. In
    addition, either the applicant or the respondent may tip the scales of
    convenience in its favour by demonstrating to the court a compelling public
    interest in the granting or refusal of the relief sought</i>. &quot;Public
    interest&quot; includes both the concerns of society generally and the
    particular interests of identifiable groups.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>We would
    therefore reject an approach which excludes consideration of any harm not
    directly suffered by a party to the application</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Admittedly, I have
    found some of the government’s evidence of harm less than compelling. My
    principal concern, however, is with the regulatory void, a matter also referred
    to by the application judge. </span> In
    that respect, I am concerned about the suggestion from counsel for the
    responding parties that the stay simply be lifted and to see what would happen.
    I cannot accept that this approach is in the public interest.  <span style='color:black'>The evidence of the
    responding parties’ witnesses, Dr. Benoit and Dr. Shaver, relied upon by the
    Attorney General of Ontario, is that simple repeal of the bawdy-house
    prohibition will not maximize the safety of prostitutes. The extensive review,
    conducted by the application judge, of the legislative framework in other
    western democracies shows that decriminalization has been accompanied, with
    varying degrees of success, by a regulatory scheme or improved social supports:  see paras. 178-213 of her reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>To conclude, by
    pointing to the findings of the application judge, the responding parties have
    demonstrated harm should a stay be granted in relation to each impugned
    provision. However, I am not satisfied that suspension of the legislation
    during the short period pending this appeal, in the absence of regulation and
    social programs, provides a sufficient public benefit to tip the balance of
    convenience in the responding parties’ favour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I intend my order staying the judgment to be
    time-limited.  This again, may to some
    extent, meet the application judge’s concern expressed in her reasons on the
    application and on the motion to extend the stay.  It is not satisfactory that the perfection of
    this appeal be delayed as occurred with the lap-dancing case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>V.        Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, an order will go staying paras. 1 to 3 of
    the judgment of Himel J.  This stay will
    be in effect until April 29, 2011 or until the appeal is argued, whichever is
    the earlier, unless varied by a further order of this court or a judge of this
    court.  The parties may wish to
    reconsider the timetable to which they had previously agreed and which would
    have delayed hearing of this appeal to sometime in late June, 2011.  I note that counsel for the responding
    parties was prepared to argue the appeal as soon as possible.  This court is available to hear this appeal
    at the end of April, before the expiration of this order.  This is not a case for costs.</p>
