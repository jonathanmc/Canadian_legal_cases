  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his convictions on charges
    of fraud by a court composed of Salmers J. and a jury in the City of Barrie.  The appellant raises two grounds of
    appeal.  He submits that the trial judge
    erred in refusing to permit him to testify about conversations he had with a
    business associate to support his defence that he did not intend to defraud the
    complainant.  Further, he submits that
    the appeal should be allowed because of the jury vetting process engaged in by
    the Barrie Crown Attorney’s office.  For
    the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE EVIDENTIARY RULING</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had been involved for several years in a
    significant office supply and office furniture business operating through two
    companies: Trillium Office <span class=GramE>Supplies  and</span> Olympia Business Machines.  However, by 2002 these businesses were
    encountering significant financial challenges and in October 2003, his
    creditors brought an application to petition the companies and the appellant
    into bankruptcy.  The applications were
    granted in part and receiving orders were made against the appellant personally
    and against Olympia in December 2003.  No
    order was made against Trillium, but it had no assets.  The fraud convictions relate to arrangements
    the appellant made for sales of office equipment in September 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the appellant’s businesses began to fail he closed
    down his various warehouses and brought unsold furniture and office equipment
    to the garage and outbuildings at his residence near Barrie.  By September 2003, the appellant’s accounts
    in chartered banks had been closed and he was conducting his financial affairs
    through Cheques-4-Cash.  He also did not
    have a normal office and was getting office support through a Mailboxes Etc.
    franchise, which was operated by Anne Earle.  The evidentiary ruling about which the appellant complains concerns
    conversations the appellant had with Ms. Earle.  Ms.&nbsp;Earle purchased items such as commercial copiers and shredders
    from the appellant, which she then resold for a profit.  Ms. Earle was not called as a witness at the
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Earle was a student of David Clare, who gave business
    coaching classes.  Mr.&nbsp;Clare
    intended to set up a new office and learned of the possibility of purchasing
    office furniture through Ms. Earle.  She
    gave him an office furniture catalogue that she had received from the appellant.  The catalogue was put out by the Global group
    of companies.  Before his financial
    difficulties, the appellant had considerable dealings with Global and he
    testified that he could still get furniture and equipment from Global at substantial
    discounts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime in early September 2003, Mr. Clare met the
    appellant by chance at Ms.&nbsp;Earle’s Mailboxes Etc. franchise.  They discussed the possibility of Mr. Clare
    purchasing furniture from the appellant.  The appellant told Mr. Clare that the furniture was for sale because of
    a split with his business partner; the furniture was his share of a settlement
    for closing the business.  He said that
    the furniture was stored in a warehouse and it would be a couple of weeks
    before he could get access to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant told Mr. Clare that the furniture would
    be sold at a 35 percent discount from the catalogue price.  He would require a 50 percent deposit when
    Mr. Clare placed his order.  He promised
    Mr. Clare that he would repay any money owing if any of the furniture could not
    be delivered.  As an incentive, the
    appellant promised to provide Mr. Clare with a free shredder that had a value
    of $4,000.  The appellant testified that
    he provided the free shredder because he hoped Mr. Clare would steer more
    business to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 16, 2003, Mr. Clare left his furniture
    order and a certified cheque for $9,000 payable to the appellant with Ms. Earle.  The appellant picked up the cheque the
    following day.  He then cashed the cheque
    at Cheques-4-Cash using $6060 to cover NSF cheques that he had previously
    cashed at Cheques-4-Cash and putting the rest of the money in his pocket.  The appellant testified that those cheques
    had been given to him by Ms. Earle for a shredder and desktop copier that she
    had purchased from him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant had attempted to recount
    conversations he had with Ms. Earle, Crown counsel (not Ms. Krick) objected,
    apparently on the basis that the evidence was hearsay.  Defence counsel and the trial judge then had
    this very brief exchange:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Defence counsel:      I
    don’t anticipate her being a witness but it’s not going for the truth of its
    content, it’s for what he did next.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Trial Judge:    You can ask him what he did as a result of a
    conversation he had with Miss Earle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This became the pattern any time, during
    examination-in-chief, that the appellant attempted to relate things that had
    been said by Ms. Earle; either the trial judge or Crown counsel would intervene.  While defence counsel again attempted to
    explain that the evidence was not going in for the truth, the trial judge
    maintained his ruling.  The trial judge
    held as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I understand your argument.  I still do not want it to go in because she
    is not here to verify it and it is not anticipated she is going to be here to
    verify it.  That is why.  And I do not want the jury to be confused by
    me having to explain to them that distinction.  And you can get the evidence in just as effectively by saying, “as a
    result of what she said, he did the following”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant attempted to explain what Ms. Earle
    told him when he asked her about the NSF cheques, the following took place:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    what did she tell you?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        That
    it was somebody else’s fault.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    as a result of your conversation …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown counsel: Again, I missed it, but I would have
    objected.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Trial Judge:    Go on, do not worry.  Go ahead.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant then explained that he received a
    replacement cheque from Ms.&nbsp;Earle.  He cashed that cheque as well and pocketed the money.  However, the appellant received a telephone
    call a few days later from Cheques-4-Cash that the replacement cheque also
    bounced.  He testified that he again
    spoke to Ms. Earle and as a result of that conversation he told Cheques-4-Cash
    that he was unable to collect the money from Ms. Earle at that point and he
    would “try to do something else”.  According
    to the appellant, the manager at Cheques-4-Cash then agreed to lend the
    appellant the $8,200, which would cover the balance of the replacement cheque
    as well as an additional $2000.  While this
    transaction was also the subject of a charge, the jury found the appellant not
    guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant delivered the shredder to Mr. Clare the
    day after he received the deposit cheque from him.  However, he did not deliver any of the
    furniture that Mr. Clare ordered.  Mr.
    Clare made several attempts to contact the appellant to find out what had
    happened.  After a dispute over the
    provincial sales tax, Mr. Clare cancelled his order.  The appellant promised to return the
    money.  He paid Mr. Clare $1,000 just
    before the bankruptcy order but nothing else.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant explained that he could not return the
    money to Mr. Clare (or any of the other complainants) because he did not have
    the funds.  And, once he was placed into
    receivership he had no control over his money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts respecting the other two complainants were
    similar to that of Mr. Clare and can be briefly summarized as follows.  Susan Peacock was co-owner of Parry
    Automotive in Orillia.  Mr. Clare told
    her about the opportunity to purchase office furniture at reduced prices from
    the appellant.  Ms. Peacock called the
    appellant and he met with her and showed her a catalogue.  He told <span class=GramE>her the</span> same
    story about the split with a business partner, that the furniture was in a
    warehouse in Toronto and that her order would be delivered in a couple of
    weeks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 25, 2003, Ms. Peacock faxed an order for
    some furniture to the appellant.  He then
    spoke to her and told her he would need a deposit and that there was a 35
    percent discount.  The appellant also
    agreed to provide Ms. Peacock with a fax/copier.  There was a dispute about this machine.  Ms. Peacock testified that the machine was
    security for her deposit and was to be free.  The appellant claimed that it was not free.  In any event, the appellant did provide the
    machine to Ms. Peacock and she gave him a cheque for $2,250 on September
    26.  The appellant cashed the cheque that
    same day at Cheques-4-Cash.  The
    appellant did not deliver the furniture and did not return the deposit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Catherine Labatt was the vice-president of Larway
    Transportation and a student of Mr. Clare’s.  She also learned about the opportunity to purchase furniture at a
    discount from the appellant.  She placed
    an order for some furniture and provided a cheque for $3,800 on September 30,
    2003.  The appellant told her the
    furniture would be delivered within one week.  The appellant immediately cashed the cheque.  When the furniture did not arrive as promised
    Ms. Labatt attempted to contact the appellant.  He eventually called her back and told her the furniture had to be
    removed from a warehouse and it would be delivered soon.  She never received the furniture <span
class=GramE>nor</span> any of the money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was not entirely clear how the appellant was going
    to fill the orders placed by the complainants.  While some of the equipment would come from the items stored at his
    residential property, the appellant would have to order most of the furniture
    from Global.  He testified that he was
    confident Global would supply the furniture to him, albeit on a
    cash-on-delivery basis.  The appellant
    testified that on October 8 he and Ms. Earle figured out what items he already
    had and then together they prepared an order to place with Global.  However, as he was preparing the order he
    realized that Ms. Peacock and Ms. Labatt had miscalculated the amount of the
    discount and did not provide large enough deposits.  As a result, he never placed the order with
    Global. He <span class=GramE>neither returned the deposits or</span> provided
    the furniture.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he spoke to Mr. Clare
    about the shortages in the deposits from Ms. Peacock and Ms. Labatt. He then
    became embroiled in a dispute with Mr.&nbsp;Clare who now wanted to lease the
    furniture rather than purchase it.  There
    was also some dispute involving P.S.T. and G.S.T.  According to the appellant, Mr. Clare not
    only cancelled his order but the orders of Ms. Peacock and Ms. Labatt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, the appellant had a further
    opportunity to explain some of his dealings with Ms. Earle.  He testified that when he was unable to
    obtain the money from Ms. Earle to cover the NSF cheques, he borrowed the money
    from Cheques-4-Cash.  He believed that he
    would get the money back from her on October 15, 2003.  Later he testified that from speaking with
    Ms. Earle he would have the money in early 2004 to pay back the
    complainants:  “the repayments that are
    promised and <span class=GramE>everything, that</span> was my understanding
    that I would be able to do it.  It never
    materialized.”  He thought he would be
    able to make the payments through Trillium, because it had not been placed into
    receivership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant agreed that he did not put the deposit
    money into any kind of separate account as he did not think he needed to.  He was unsure what he had done with the money
    after cashing the deposit cheques, although he thought some of it probably went
    to pay legal fees.  The appellant also
    had various other debts during this time, including $70,000 that he owed for
    taxes.  The only way he would be able to
    pay for the furniture from Global or pay back the complainants was if Ms. Earle
    paid him the money she owed him.  He
    testified as follows in cross-examination:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And
    so you were assuming once you placed that order with Global, that you would
    have some other money coming in from some other source that you would then use
    to pay Global for the furniture that you would then sell to these three people,
    correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>And I was told from Anne that I’d have my
    money and we placed the order accordingly, yes.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Right.  So you were relying on Anne to pay you the
    money that you could then pay to Global?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Anne
    got the people’s money in the first place right, when the cheque bounced?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Yeah,
    but Anne wasn’t going to – you weren’t relying on the rest of their money to
    pay for the original order, they paid you a deposit already.  They would only pay you …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        That’s
    right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>Q.        … the remainder when you delivered the furniture?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        And
    had the orders been proper, I would have then had more than sufficient funds to
    do it and it’s discovered when we’re doing the order that we didn’t get enough
    money from them.  <span class=GramE>Right?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Just
    getting back again to my original question.  <i>When you were thinking about
    placing the order for Global Furniture the money that you expected to use for
    that would have come from Anne Earle because she owed you money?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=right style='text-align:right'>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified in re-examination that the last
    time he talked to Ms. Earle was in 2004.  They were not on friendly terms because she never paid him the money she
    owed him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was the position of Crown counsel at trial that the
    appellant’s dealings with the complainants were dishonest; that he was in
    desperate financial straits, had no sources of income and yet immediately
    pocketed the deposits from the complainants which he then used for his own
    purposes such as legal fees.  However,
    that position hinged in part on the appellant’s dealings with Ms. Earle.  It was Crown counsel’s position that the
    appellant could not reasonably have believed that Ms. Earle would make good on
    her N.S.F. cheques.  She said the
    following in her closing address to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The accused admitted that his plan was that he
    would use the money that Anne Earle owed to him and was supposed to pay him
    back, to purchase the furniture on behalf of the complainants.  Given that Miss Earle had written him two
    N.S.F. cheques prior to his deal with Mr. Clare, and three N.S.F. cheques by
    the time he made his deals with Susan Peacock and Catherine Labatt, the Crown’s
    position is that he could not have had an honest, reasonable expectation that
    Miss Earle would pay him back in order that he might be able to fulfill his
    promises to Mr. Clare, Miss Peacock, and Miss Labatt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge repeated this position in his charge to
    the jury. He told the jury that it was the Crown’s theory that the appellant
    “could not have had an honest, reasonable expectation that Ms. Earl would pay
    him back in order that he might be able to fulfill his promises”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge erred in law by refusing to
    permit the appellant to relate his conversations with Ms. Earle concerning the
    N.S.F. cheques.  As defence counsel
    explained at trial, the evidence was not being tendered for its truth.  In fairness to the trial judge, defence
    counsel (not Mr. Halfyard) did not clearly articulate the basis for admission
    of the evidence.  Defence counsel merely
    stated that the evidence was being tendered “for what he did next”.  In fact, the real probative value of the
    evidence lay in informing the appellant’s belief that he would be able to pay
    for the furniture from Global or repay the complainants.  Out-of-court statements tendered to show an
    accused’s belief, assuming that belief to be relevant, are not hearsay and are
    admissible.  In <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915 at p. 926, Lamer C.J. adopted the
    following statement from <i>R. v. Blastland</i>,
    [1986] A.C. 41 (H.L.) at p. 54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>It is, of
    course, elementary that statements made to a witness by a third party are not
    excluded by the hearsay rule when they are put in evidence solely to prove the
    state of mind </i>either of the maker of the statement or<i> of the person to whom it was made</i>. <i>What a person</i> said or<i> heard
    said may well be the best and most direct evidence of that person's state of
    mind.</i> This principle can only apply, however, when the state of mind
    evidenced by the statement is either itself directly in issue at the trial or
    of direct and immediate relevance to an issue which arises at the trial.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Crown counsel recognized in her jury address, the
    appellant’s state of mind was relevant.  The appellant should have been allowed to tell the jury what Ms. Earle
    told him that led him to believe that she would repay the money she owed,
    despite the fact that she had given him three N.S.F. cheques over a very short
    period of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reason for not allowing the appellant
    to relate the conversations he had with Ms. Earle was that the jury would be
    confused between the hearsay and non-hearsay uses of the evidence because she
    would not be at the trial “to verify it”.  In my view, this concern was misplaced.  It is well-established that juries are presumed to be able to follow
    instructions, even complex jury instructions concerning the application of the
    hearsay rule.  Consider for example, the
    instructions a trial judge must give a jury in accordance with <i>R. v. Carter</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, where
    the Crown seeks to rely on the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the instructions that would have to be
    given in this case would not have been complex or difficult for the jury to
    follow.  It would simply be necessary to
    tell the jury that the appellant was permitted to relate what Ms. Earle told
    him so that the jury could assess the honesty and reasonableness of his belief
    that she would repay him.  The trial
    judge would have to caution the jury that since Ms. Earle did not testify, the
    jury had no evidence that Ms. Earle actually had the means to repay the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, to be fair to the trial judge, if as defence
    counsel stated, the evidence was tendered solely to show what the appellant did
    next, it was not necessary to tender the actual conversations.  As the trial judge said, the appellant could
    put his case just as effectively by saying what he did as a result of speaking
    to Ms. Earle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Crown submits that no substantial wrong
    of miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the trial judge’s ruling.  Ms. Krick puts her position on two bases.  First, the ruling did not in fact prevent the
    appellant from putting the substance of his defence.  Second, in any event, the appellant’s belief
    that he would be able to repay the complainants was no defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing with Ms. Krick’s first argument. The jury was
    aware of the following things Ms. Earle told the appellant, in great part due
    to Crown counsel’s cross-examination of the appellant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Earle told the appellant that it was
    somebody else’s fault that the first two cheques were N.S.F.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Earle told the appellant he would get his
    money.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the third cheque was returned N.S.F., the
    appellant learned from a conversation with Ms. Earle that he would not be
    getting his money immediately; at this time he then made the arrangements to
    borrow money from Cheques-4-Cash.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result of what Ms. Earle told him he believed
    he would get the money and would be able to repay the deposits or pay for the
    Global order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant tried unsuccessfully to collect
    the money from Ms. Earle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel submits that hearing the actual substance
    of what Ms. Earle told the appellant would not have appreciably bolstered the
    defence, especially since Ms. Earle was not going to be called to support the
    appellant’s position.<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s second argument turns on the
    definition of fraud.  As McLachlin&nbsp;J.
    pointed out in <i>R. v. Theroux</i>, [1993]
    2 S.C.R. 5 and <i>R. v. Zlatic</i>, [1993]
    2&nbsp;S.C.R. 29, the fact that an accused may have hoped the deprivation would
    not take place is no defence.  All that
    the Crown had to prove was that the appellant knew that he was undertaking a
    prohibited act that could cause deprivation in the sense of depriving the
    complainants of their property or putting their property at risk.  The appellant’s dealings with Ms. Earle did
    not meet the Crown’s case.  Even if the
    appellant honestly and reasonably believed that Ms. Earle would make good on
    the replacement cheque, that would have been sufficient only to pay back part
    of the loan to Cheques-4-Cash.  The
    replacement cheque would not have been sufficient to cover the complainants’
    deposits. Further, that money would not support the furniture order to Global,
    which the appellant had to pay for when the goods were delivered.  The appellant conceded that he had used the
    complainants’ deposits, which totalled approximately $15,000, for his own
    purposes.  The appellant had no other
    source of income and had other very substantial debts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Wildman</i>,
    [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311 at p. 329, Lamer J. explained the application of the
    proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) (then s. 613(1)(b)(iii)) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> where  a trial judge erroneously excludes potentially
    exculpatory evidence, which explains the appellant’s state of mind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But when the error of law is the preclusion of
    exculpatory evidence, then the determination must be made with regard to the
    entirety of the evidence, that evidence having been included, and in the light
    of the effect the excluded evidence could, within reason, possibly have had on
    the evidence that did go to the jury. Any reasonable effect that excluded
    evidence could have had on the jury should, in applying s. 613(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span><i>b</i>)(iii), enure to the benefit of the accused. When
    the excluded evidence is, as in this case, of a certain importance and might
    reasonably have had an effect on the jury then, even assuming we in this Court
    would have nevertheless convicted, I find it difficult to be satisfied that the
    jury would have necessarily agreed with us. Any reasonable, possible effect of
    that excluded evidence on the jury should enure to the benefit of Wildman.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the respondent has met that test.  The excluded evidence could not reasonably
    have had an effect on the jury given the evidence the jury did have about the
    appellant’s dealings with Ms. Earle. The evidence available to the jury was
    sufficient for the defence’s proposition that the appellant believed Ms. Earle
    would repay him.  In this respect it must
    also be kept in mind that the appellant was not prevented from saying what he
    did as a result of speaking to Ms. Earle, which was the only basis upon which
    the evidence was sought to be admitted at trial.  I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE JURY VETTING ISSUE</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 2009, many months after the appellant had been
    convicted and filed his notice of <span class=GramE>appeal,</span> possible
    improprieties in the jury selection process in Barrie came to light.  The Crown Law Office-Criminal has disclosed the
    jury lists and other materials in relation to the appellant’s case, which the
    appellant seeks to introduce as fresh evidence.  The proposed fresh evidence demonstrates the
    following.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 4, 2008, staff in the Court Services
    Division of the Ministry of the Attorney General provided a copy of the jury
    panel list for the week of September 22 to the Barrie Crown’s Office.  On September 10, an administrative assistant
    in the Crown Attorney’s office sent copies of the jury list to five local
    Ontario Provincial Police Detachments and the Midland Police Service with a
    memo that included the following requests:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Please check the attached jury panel list, for the
    persons listed in your locality, and <i>advise
    if any of them have criminal records</i>.  We are not able to provide dates of birth.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>It would also
    be helpful if comments could be made concerning any disreputable persons we
    would not want as a juror</i>.  All we
    can ask is that you do your best considering the lack of information available
    to us.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The memo, which was a standard form letter, was signed
    by the staff member on behalf of the Crown Attorney.  The administrative assistant who sent out the
    list received back the annotated lists, which she then used to compile a master
    list that Crown counsel used to assist her in jury selection.  Trial Crown counsel did not disclose the
    annotated list to defence counsel.  This
    appears to have been consistent with the policy in the Barrie Crown’s office
    despite an explicit 2006 memo from the Assistant Deputy Attorney General.  That memo directed Crown counsel not to
    undertake an investigation into the list of jurors, other than criminal record
    checks, and required that “criminal record checks, if done, and any concrete
    information provided by police to the Crown suggesting that an individual may
    not be impartial, should be disclosed to the defence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The checks done by the police in response to the
    request from the Crown Attorney varied somewhat.  In general, it appears that a civilian
    employee did the checks by consulting various databases that are available only
    to the police.  These include CPIC, which
    is a national database, and Niche RMS, which is a database that manages
    investigative records of police agencies.  Both CPIC and Niche RMS contain much more information than simply
    records of criminal convictions and can include information about outstanding
    warrants, various court orders, charges, police contacts and investigations
    relating to individuals and locations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The information provided to Crown counsel by the police
    was limited; usually consisting of the note “OK”, which Crown counsel
    understood to mean that the juror did not have a criminal record.  There were, however, several more elaborate
    comments.  For example, against one juror
    was the note:  “CNI 1995 Drugs no
    convictions” [CNI is Criminal Name Index].  And, against several names was the note: “possible”, which Crown counsel interpreted as meaning that the juror
    possibly had a criminal record.  Crown
    counsel acknowledged that the notations were a factor in her decision as to how
    she exercised her peremptory challenges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all, four people were called forward at jury
    selection about <span class=GramE>whom</span> Crown counsel had information
    showing a possible criminal history.  Of
    those four, Crown counsel challenged two of them, and defence counsel
    challenged the other two<span style='color:red'>.</span>  The two challenged by defence counsel were as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.        Juror 5679, the juror whose name had the
    notation “CNI 1995 Drugs no convictions” was subject to peremptory challenge
    first by defence counsel.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.        Similarly, defence counsel challenged
    juror 2818, whose name had the notation “possible”.  Defence counsel had the first challenge with
    this juror as well.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the pattern of use of information by Crown
    counsel, it is likely that she would have challenged both of these jurors, had
    defence counsel not done so.  In this
    case, Crown and defence counsel each had 12 peremptory challenges.  At the end of jury selection, defence counsel
    had two peremptory challenges remaining.  Crown counsel had one peremptory challenge remaining.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Legal Framework for Jury Selection</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jury selection is governed by the <i>Criminal Code</i> and provincial legislation.  Provincial legislation is relevant because of
    s. 626(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which
    provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A person who is
    qualified as a juror according to, and summoned as a juror in accordance with,
    the laws of a province is qualified to serve as a juror in criminal proceedings
    in that province.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 4(b) of the <i>Juries Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. J.3, as it then read, a person was
    ineligible to serve as a juror if the person had been convicted of an
    indictable offence for which they had not been granted a pardon.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It should also be noted that s. 20 of the <i>Juries Act,</i> as it then stood, provided
    that the jury roll was to be kept under lock and key by the sheriff until 10
    days before the sittings of the court for which the panel has been
    drafted.  It will be recalled that in
    this case court services provided the list for the September 22 sittings to the
    Crown’s office on September 4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other relevant statutory provision is s. 638(1)(c)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides
    that a prosecutor or an accused may challenge a juror for cause on the basis
    that the juror has been convicted of an offence for which the person was
    sentenced to death or to a term of imprisonment exceeding twelve months.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the undisclosed
    jury vetting that occurred in this case resulted in a miscarriage of justice
    requiring that the convictions be set aside, and a new trial ordered.  That submission is based on the fact that the
    information about criminal history was not disclosed and, more broadly, on the
    impact on the administration of justice.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Non-disclosure</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent concedes that information
    about the possible criminal history of prospective jurors should have been
    disclosed to the defence.  I agree with
    that concession.  The Crown’s disclosure
    obligation is a broad one and as recently expressed by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, [2009] 1
    S.C.R. 66 at para. 17 <span class=GramE>includes</span> “any information in
    respect of which there is a reasonable possibility that it may assist the
    accused in the exercise of the right to make full answer and defence”.  As Dickson C.J. said in <i>R. v. Barrow,</i> [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694 at p. 710, “selection of an
    impartial jury is crucial to a fair trial”.  In my view, information about criminal history of jurors, obtained from
    police databases and in the possession of the Crown, is relevant to the right
    to make full answer and defence.  Such
    information could affect the juror’s eligibility for serving on the jury in
    accordance with the <i>Juries Act</i> and
    the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  The information would also be relevant to a
    possible challenge for cause under s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The information would also be of assistance
    to the accused in deciding whether to exercise peremptory challenges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impact of the failure to disclose this information
    must be analyzed in accordance with the framework established by the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Dixon</i>,
    [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 and <i>R. v. Taillefer</i>,
    [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307.  As explained in <i>R.&nbsp;v. Dixon</i> at paragraphs 33 and
    34, the appellant must demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that the
    failure to disclose impaired the right to make full answer and defence.  This burden is discharged where the appellant
    demonstrates that there is a reasonable possibility the non-disclosure
    “affected the outcome at trial or the overall fairness of the trial
    process”.  Similarly, see <i>R. v. Taillefer</i> at paragraphs 77 to
    84.  Information of the type that should
    have been disclosed in this case is not easily analyzed under this test, which
    is directed more to the reliability of the trial verdict because of information
    relating to the commission of the offence or possible defences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The failure of disclosure in this case had no impact on
    the reliability of the verdict.  The
    information was unrelated to the elements of the offence or anything to do with
    the appellant’s defence to the charges.  In my view, there is also no reasonable possibility that the
    non-disclosure had any impact on the partiality of the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that had defence counsel known of
    the undisclosed information regarding jurors 5679 and 2818, he would not have
    used two of his peremptory challenges to challenge them, since he would know
    that Crown counsel would challenge them.  That may be, but at the end of jury selection defence counsel still had two
    peremptory challenges remaining.  The
    fact that he may have “wasted” two challenges did not impact on the kind of
    jury he wanted to try the case.  There
    was not a reasonable possibility that the non-disclosure had any impact on the
    verdict since, one way or another, jurors 5679 and 2818 were not going to be on
    that jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the same reasons, I am of the view that the
    non-disclosure did not affect the overall fairness of the trial process.  True, defence counsel might well have
    reserved the two challenges that were used on jurors 5679 and 2818, but since
    he still had two challenges remaining, the actual composition of the jury from
    the defence point of view was unaffected.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is only one possible scenario that might have
    changed the way in which the challenges were exercised.  This scenario is raised in written
    submissions counsel were invited to make following release of this court’s
    decision in <i>R. v. Yumnu</i>, 2010 ONCA
    637. Had Crown counsel been forced to use two of her challenges on jurors 5679
    and 2818, she would not have had a challenge left when it came to consider
    juror 2586, the last juror actually challenged by Crown counsel.  What do we know of juror 2586?  This juror disclosed his occupation during the
    jury selection as “Senior Bankruptcy Analyst and Official Receiver”.  In his written submissions counsel for the
    appellant suggest this juror “may have been someone the defence wanted to have
    on the jury given their occupation and the perspective they might bring to this
    case” in view of the defence theory that this was a civil wrong. That hardly
    seems likely but, in any event, to suggest that the overall fairness of the
    trial process was impacted in those circumstances descends from the reasonably
    possible to mere speculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this case was under reserve the decision of the
    Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v.
    Hobbs</i> (2010), 257 C.C.C. (3d) 411 was decided.  That case has been reviewed by Watt J.A. in <i>R. v. Yumnu</i>, and I need not repeat that
    analysis.  Suffice to say that it is
    distinguishable from this case.  In <i>Hobbs</i>, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal
    found that there was an actual impact on the jury selection, a factor not
    present in this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Appearance of Justice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, even if the appellant cannot meet the <i>Dixon</i> test from the non-disclosure, it
    is still open to him to argue more broadly that the appeal should be allowed
    under s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> on the ground that there has been a miscarriage of
    justice.  The allegation of a miscarriage
    of justice rests on the appearance of justice and includes the non-disclosure,
    the violations of the <i>Juries Act</i> and
    provincial privacy legislation, misuse of police databases and the wording of
    the memo from the Crown Attorney.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before addressing those issues, I think it is necessary
    to consider some further contextual elements.  The most important contextual factor is that while both the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the <i>Juries Act </i>contemplate that persons with
    criminal records of certain kinds not be eligible for jury duty, the
    legislation at the time this case was tried provided no formal procedure for
    making criminal record checks.  While a questionnaire
    sent to potential jurors asks them to identify whether or not they had a
    criminal record, that system was found by the Information and Privacy
    Commissioner to be “seriously flawed”:  Information
    and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario<i>,
    Excessive Background Checks Conducted on Prospective Jurors: A Special
    Investigative Report</i> (Toronto: Information and Privacy Commissioner of
    Ontario, 2009) at p. 141.  There was thus
    nothing wrong <i>per se</i> about checking
    the criminal records of potential jurors.  Indeed, the Information and Privacy Commissioner concluded that
    disclosure by the police to Crown counsel of criminal record information
    relevant to juror criminal conviction eligibility did not violate provincial
    privacy legislation:  <i>Excessive Background Checks Conducted on
    Prospective Jurors: <span class=GramE>A</span> Special Investigation Report</i> at p. 127.  However, the Commissioner
    found that the collection by the police and disclosure to the Crown of other
    personal information going beyond criminal conviction information did breach the
    legislation.  And, of course, Crown
    counsel’s failure to disclose criminal conviction information to the defence is
    a breach of the Crown’s disclosure obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, as Watt J.A. observed in <i>R. v. Yumnu</i>, at para. 74, the Law Society of Upper Canada and the
    Canadian Bar Association rules of professional conduct do not prohibit
    inquiries for the purpose of exercising a challenge for cause, which would
    include a challenge under s. 638(1)(c):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In express terms or by
    necessary implication, both sets of <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i> permit
    inquiries about prospective jurors to ascertain any basis for challenge and use
    of the results of those inquiries as the basis for a challenge. The <i>Rules</i> require disclosure of any information obtained to both the presiding judge and
    opposing counsel and bar any direct or indirect communication with the
    prospective jurors or members of their family. The scope of permitted inquiry
    would include investigations about criminal records. Impermissible inquiries
    contravene a fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system: <i>R. v. Latimer</i>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217, at para. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, while defence counsel may have “wasted” two of
    his peremptory challenges, arguably so did Crown counsel.  Rather than use two of her peremptory challenges
    on the two jurors with the notations “possible”, Crown counsel could first have
    attempted a challenge for cause under s. 638(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> on the basis that
    the jurors had been convicted of an offence for which they were sentenced to
    imprisonment for a term of 12 months or more.  Alternatively, Crown counsel could have brought the fact of the possible
    criminal record to the attention of the trial judge and asked the trial judge
    to exclude the juror on the basis that the juror was ineligible to serve
    pursuant to s. 626(1).  It would seem to
    me that such ineligibility falls within the words of s. 632(c), which allows a
    trial judge to excuse a juror for “any other reasonable cause that, in the
    opinion of the judge, warrants that the juror be excused”.  Obviously to do so would be preferable since
    it is a transparent process and would have been consistent with Crown counsel’s
    disclosure obligations.  On the other
    hand, simply exercising the peremptory challenges was far less embarrassing to
    the jurors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will now address the various elements of the
    miscarriage of justice claim:  the
    non-disclosure, the violations of the <i>Juries
    Act</i> and provincial privacy legislation, misuse of police databases and the
    wording of the memo from the Crown Attorney.  I do not need to say anything further about the non-disclosure of the
    information provided to Crown counsel.  The failure to disclose was a breach of the disclosure obligations on
    Crown counsel.  However, that breach had
    no discernable impact on the composition of the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the alleged breach of provincial privacy
    legislation adds nothing to the miscarriage of justice claim.  The rights that may have been infringed were
    those of the potential jurors, not the appellant.  Those claims have been fully investigated by
    the Information and Privacy Commissioner and she has made recommendations to
    protect the privacy rights of the citizens of Ontario.  Those recommendations have been followed up
    by the province with amendments to the <i>Juries
    Act</i>, ss. 4(b) and 18.2 and the <i>Juries
    Act </i>Regulations, R.R.O. 1990, reg. 680 as amended by O. Reg. 231/10. That
    is the appropriate remedy. To grant the appellant a remedy for breach of the
    rights of potential jurors would be excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most troubling aspects of the case are the misuse
    of the police databases and the wording of the letter from the Crown Attorney,
    especially inclusion of the phrase:  “It
    would also be helpful if comments could be made concerning any disreputable
    persons we would not want as a juror.”  This
    use of police resources and attempt to align the Crown with the police is
    inconsistent with Crown counsel’s obligation to ensure that the accused
    receives a fair trial.  But, what
    occurred must be put in context.  The
    information actually supplied was of limited utility and related to criminal
    record information, except in two respects.  A civilian employee of the OPP Huronia West detachment identified two
    potential jurors with criminal history not resulting in convictions.  I have already referred to the one juror who
    was identified as having “1995 Drugs no convictions”.  This juror was challenged by the defence, so
    there is no way of knowing how Crown counsel would have used the information.
    The information did not impact on the appearance of fairness of the trial. Another
    juror was identified as being “Suspect in Assualt/Accused Theft Under 2006 –
    CNI:  Theft no convictions 2006”.  This juror was never called forward for the
    jury selection process.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The collection and disclosure of this information was a
    misuse of the police databases and should not have occurred.  It would appear to be a product of the Crown
    Attorney’s letter, which was improperly worded.  But, did this process so taint the administration of justice that a
    verdict reached by a properly constituted jury be set aside?  In my view, that would be a disproportionate
    reaction.  The conduct of the police
    service and the Crown Attorney’s office is not the kind of egregious misconduct
    that brings the administration of justice into disrepute or would lead
    reasonable people to believe that the appearance of justice had been
    undermined.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellant has not established that his
    conviction should be set aside on the basis of a miscarriage of justice.</p>
