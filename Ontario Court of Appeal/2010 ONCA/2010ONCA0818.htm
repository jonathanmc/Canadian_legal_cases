  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction by a court
    composed of Scott J. and a jury for first degree murder of a police
    officer.  He submits that the Crown
    participated in illegal “jury vetting” and that the trial judge misdirected the
    jury with respect to the use of expert evidence concerning the crucial issue of
    the appellant’s state of mind.  For the
    following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was not disputed that the appellant killed Officer
    Christopher Garrett of the Cobourg Police Service in the early morning hours of
    May 15, 2004.  The only issue at trial
    was whether the appellant had the intent for murder.  Given the narrow nature of the issues at
    trial and on appeal, only a brief summary of the facts is required.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Events of May 2004</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 2004, the appellant began to plan a
    confrontation with police that would involve the killing of at least one police
    officer and perhaps the killing of other people.  A jury could also find that the appellant
    intended to die during the confrontation.  In the week prior to the confrontation, the appellant planned a series
    of events that would begin with a false complaint of a robbery.  During this week, the appellant spent hours
    researching guns, knives and bomb-making.  He stole firearms and ammunition from his father and step-father and
    assembled bombs and Molotov cocktails.  On
    May 15, 2004, between 1:34 and 1:41 a.m. he composed a suicide note which he
    left on his computer.  He then put the
    series of events into action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant went to the parking lot of an abandoned
    hospital and at 2:59 a.m. called 911.  He
    identified himself and falsely reported a robbery.  Officer Garrett was the first to arrive,
    followed by other officers and a security guard from the hospital.  The appellant told the officer that he had
    been robbed of his wallet at knifepoint.  The other officers left in search of the robber and the security guard
    returned to the hospital.  At 3:15 a.m.,
    Officer Garrett made an announcement over the police radio giving further
    details of the alleged assailant.  By
    3:20 a.m. he was no longer responding.  The appellant had slit the officer’s throat in one single motion.  The officer did not die immediately and
    managed to discharge his firearm hitting the appellant once in the leg.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the stabbing, the appellant tried to gain entry
    to the hospital.  He then returned to the
    body of the deceased and removed his duty belt and firearm.  He also retrieved a sawed-off shotgun from a
    backpack that he had hidden before the attendance of the police and tried to
    get into the police cruiser.  Sometime
    before 4:00 a.m., the appellant called his mother and asked her to pick him up
    at his school, which was a short distance from the hospital.  She eventually found the appellant.  He told her that he had been shot and that he
    had stabbed a police officer.  The
    appellant’s mother briefly took him home and then to the hospital.  On the way to the hospital, the appellant
    called the police and said he was on the way to the hospital and was going to
    turn himself in.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was arrested at the hospital.  He was co-operative and three days later gave
    a videotaped statement to the police.  The appellant did not discuss his state of mind in the statement and
    specifically denied that he was thinking about suicide.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Defence Expert Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence called three expert witnesses.  All three testified that the appellant
    suffered from a major depressive illness.  Dr. Alan Leschied testified that in his opinion the appellant’s main
    goal was to commit suicide, although he could not rule out that the appellant
    was prepared to kill others to attain his goal.  He did not form an opinion about the appellant’s specific state of mind
    at the time of the killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Jonathon Gray and Dr. Clive Chamberlain testified that
    in their opinion the appellant was not of clear mind when he stabbed the
    deceased and that he was not considering the consequences of his actions.  Dr. Gray believed that any plans that the
    appellant had formed prior to arriving at the parking lot changed once he
    realized the enormity of what he had intended to do.  He believed that the appellant abandoned his
    plan to commit suicide and panicked.  Dr.
    Chamberlain’s opinion was that the appellant’s thoughts were disorganized and
    chaotic and that he did not have the intent to kill.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Gray and Dr. Chamberlain had met with the appellant
    on multiple occasions prior to the trial and based their opinions, at least in
    part, on the appellant’s account of the events, including his state of mind at
    the time of the killing.  The appellant
    did not testify at the trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Other Evidence of the Appellant’s State of Mind</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s mother testified about what she
    observed when she picked him up the night of the killing.  There was also evidence of hospital personnel
    as to the appellant’s appearance and demeanour.  The appellant’s mother and father testified about the appellant’s
    background and upbringing.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Charge to the Jury</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in two
    respects in the charge to the jury.  First, he erred in placing a burden on the appellant to prove the facts
    upon which the expert opinions were based.  Second, the trial judge failed to adequately simplify the expert
    evidence in a way that the jury would appreciate the single issue of the
    appellant’s state of mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ground of appeal concerning the burden of proof
    relates to directions such as the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Before any
    weight can be given to an expert’s opinion, the facts upon which it is based
    must be found by you to exist.  </i>The more
    the expert has relied upon facts <i>not
    proved in evidence before you – for example the hearsay utterances by Troy
    Davey and his parents – </i>the less weight you may attribute to his or her
    opinion.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, when these and the other similar directions
    are placed in proper context, there was no error.  The problem was that to a considerable
    extent, the opinions of the defence experts turned on what they were told by
    the appellant and on hearsay statements made by the appellant to his mother and
    others.  The trial judge correctly
    instructed the jury that these statements were not admissible for their
    truth.  It was in that context that the
    jury would understand the trial judge’s references to proven facts.  The trial judge was not placing a burden on
    the appellant to prove every fact upon which the experts’ opinions were
    based.  Rather, he was making it clear
    that the weight to be attached to the opinions was affected by the extent to
    which those opinions depended upon the hearsay utterances of the
    appellant.  For example, after reviewing
    in considerable detail the expert evidence, the trial judge told this to the
    jury under the heading “EXPERT OPINIONS BASED WHOLLY OR IN PART ON HEARSAY”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An expert opinion is admissible even if it is based
    on second-hand evidence or hearsay evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This second-hand evidence is only admissible
    however to show the information on which the expert’s opinion is based. It is
    not evidence as to the truth of the second-hand evidence or, in other words,
    the existence of the facts on which the opinion is based. Let me make this
    clear: what was said by Troy Davey or his parents to the psychologist or
    psychiatrists is hearsay and cannot be considered by you in determining what
    happened in this case. It can only be used by you in assessing the opinions of
    the psychologist and psychiatrists.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where, as here, the psychological and psychiatric
    evidence is comprised of hearsay and admissible evidence, for example, the
    results of the psychological tests, the drawings and the writings of Troy
    Davey, and the testimony before you of his parents, the problem is the weight
    to be attributed to that opinion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before any weight can be given to an expert’s
    opinion, the facts upon which it is based must be found by you to exist. The
    more the expert has relied upon facts not proved in evidence before you – for
    example the hearsay utterances by Troy Davey and his parents – the less weight
    you may attribute to his or her opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These instructions accord with the decisions of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Abbey, </i>[1982]
    2 S.C.R. 24 and <i>R. v. Lavallee</i>,
    [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852 and decisions of this court such as <i>R. v. Kirkby</i> (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 31.  For example, in <i>Lavallee</i> at p. 893, Wilson J. set out the following principles for
    considering what weight to attach to an expert opinion based in part on
    hearsay:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.      An expert
    opinion is admissible if relevant, even if it is based on second-hand evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.&nbsp;     This
    second-hand evidence (hearsay) is admissible to show the information on which
    the expert opinion is based, not as evidence going to the existence of the
    facts on which the opinion is based.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.&nbsp;
        Where the psychiatric evidence is
    comprised of hearsay evidence, the problem is the weight to be attributed to
    the opinion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.&nbsp;     <i>Before any weight can be given to an
    expert's opinion, the facts upon which the opinion is based must be found to
    exist.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wilson J. then considered the directions given by the
    trial judge in that case, which included the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;<i>If the premises upon which the information
    is substantially based has not been proven in evidence</i>, it is up to you to
    conclude that it is not safe to attach a great deal of weight to the opinion.
    An opinion of an expert depends, to a large extent, on the validity of the facts
    assumed by the evidence by the expert.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Speaking for the court at p. 894 Wilson J. found that
    these instructions were correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarize, the instructions that the trial judge
    gave to the jury did not place any burden of proof on the appellant.  Those instructions would have been understood
    as referring to the hearsay evidence, which was admitted for the limited
    purpose of understanding the basis of the experts’ opinions, but was not
    admissible for its truth.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am also satisfied that the charge to the jury
    adequately directed the jury as to the essential issue in the case; namely, the
    state of mind of the appellant at the time of this killing.  While the trial judge briefly discussed the
    other elements of the offence of first degree murder, the only extended
    discussion concerned the state of mind required for murder.  Similarly, while the trial judge briefly
    summarized the evidence of all the witnesses called, again the only extended
    discussion of the evidence was that of the experts.  The trial judge summarized the expert
    evidence in a way that was entirely fair and accurate and made clear the
    essential positions taken by the experts.  Finally, the trial judge’s summary of the positions of the Crown and
    defence focused on the issue of the appellant’s state of mind and whether he
    had the intention required for murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge conveyed to the jury the
    essential issue upon which the case turned and sufficiently referred to the
    evidence bearing on that issue.  I would not
    give effect to these grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE JURY VETTING ISSUE</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appeal was pending, information came to light
    suggesting that Crown counsel in some jurisdictions were asking police to check
    various databases for whether potential jurors had criminal histories. The
    appellant seeks to introduce as fresh evidence information of what he alleges
    to be improper vetting of a jury panel in his case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury array in this matter came from two panel
    lists.  These lists were provided to the
    Crown on December 18, 2006, 21 days before the jury was empanelled.  The lists would have been available to the
    defence at the same time and trial counsel (not Mr.&nbsp;Hicks) believes that
    he received the list a couple of weeks before the trial.  Section 20 of the <i>Juries Act</i> provides that the jury list shall not be disclosed until
    ten days before the sittings of the court for which the panel has been
    drafted.  The parties speculate that the
    early disclosure in this case is related to the fact that the Christmas holidays
    intervened before the January 8, 2007 scheduled date for the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the practice in the Crown’s office
    in this jurisdiction, copies of the lists were provided to the court officers
    from the three local police services in the region from which the jurors would
    be drawn.  The officers were asked for
    their opinions as to the suitability of any of the potential jurors about whom
    they had an opinion.  The officers added
    notations such as “good”, “yes”, “ok” or “no” to their copies of the lists,
    which were then returned to the Crown.  An employee of the Cobourg Crown’s office then transferred the
    information to a master list.  The master
    list was given to Crown counsel prosecuting the appellant, but not to defence
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court officers who received the lists might ask
    fellow officers for their opinions.  They
    did not, however, access police databases such as CPIC.  The common understanding of the police and
    Crown was that the Crown was inviting comments based on the officers’ knowledge
    of potential jurors in the community.  One
    of the court officers noticed that the deceased’s brother-in-law was on the
    jury list.  The officer notified Crown
    counsel who in turn notified the court and this person was removed from the
    jury array.  Comments were made in
    relation to 118 of the 400 potential jurors.  In this case, there was a challenge for cause.  Thirteen of the 118 jurors about whom there
    were comments, made it past the challenge for cause stage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel, who was from Toronto, showed his copy
    of the list to the appellant, his family and possibly the local referring
    solicitor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel prosecuting the appellant’s case made
    only limited use of the information, since the one word comments provided only
    limited information.  For example, Crown
    counsel selected one of the potential jurors who had negative comments because
    the juror’s responses and demeanour during the challenge for cause was much
    more significant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After jury selection, the case was adjourned for two
    weeks.  During this time, the
    investigating officer learned that a court security officer believed she heard
    a comment from one of the selected jurors indicating a bias against the
    appellant.  The investigating officer
    drew this matter to Crown counsel’s attention.  He in turn notified the court and defence counsel.  Following a hearing, this juror was
    discharged.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the jury vetting in this
    case violated various provincial statutes concerning protection of privacy as
    well as the <i>Juries Act</i>.  He submits that the failure to disclose the
    information in the master list was a breach of the Crown’s disclosure
    obligations.  Finally, he submits that
    the non-disclosure and the use Crown counsel made of the information led to an
    appearance of unfairness thus requiring a new trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Violation of Provincial Legislation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The premature release of the jury list in apparent
    violation of s. 20 of the <i>Juries Act</i> does not affect the fairness of the trial or the validity of the jury selection
    process.  The appellant submits that the
    purpose of the requirement that the list be kept under lock and key until ten
    days before the sittings of the court is so that neither Crown nor defence
    receives an unfair advantage.  That may
    or may not be the purpose of the legislation.  In any event, there is no evidence that the Crown did obtain an unfair
    advantage by reason of the release 21 days before the sittings of the
    court.  According to the agreed statement
    of facts the defence also received the list before the ten-day period.  There is no evidence to show that the defence
    was hampered in any way in making whatever inquiries it wished in preparation
    for jury selection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that in seeking opinions
    from police officers, the Crown and the police violated various provisions of
    provincial privacy legislation such as the <i>Freedom
    of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 and the <i>Municipal Freedom of Information and
    Protection of Privacy Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56.  This is a complex legislative scheme with
    various exceptions permitting disclosure of information in the law enforcement
    context.  The matter has been examined by
    the Privacy Commissioner, who has issued a report, <i>Excessive Background Checks Conducted on Prospective Jurors: <span
class=GramE>A</span> Special Investigative Report </i>(Toronto: Information and
    Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, 2009) which will no doubt be helpful in the
    future to the government in shaping privacy policy. In fact, there have already
    been amendments to the <i>Juries Act</i> since the jury vetting issue came to public attention.  However, the appellant has not established
    any violations of the legislation.  In
    any event, violations of privacy legislation do not in and of themselves
    undermine the fairness of the jury selection process.  In this case, the appellant has not
    articulated how the alleged violation of this provincial legislation undermined
    the fairness of his trial and, in particular, how alleged violations of the
    privacy rights of others (the potential jurors) affected his right to a fair
    trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disclosure</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s disclosure obligations are broad but they
    are not unlimited.  In my view, the limit
    is reached where what is sought is nothing more than the personal opinions of
    police officers about potential jurors.  The most recent explanation of the Crown’s obligation is provided in <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66 at
    para. 17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown's obligation to disclose all relevant
    information in its possession relating to the investigation against an accused
    is well established. The duty is triggered upon request and does not require an
    application to the court. <span class=italic1><span style='color:black'>Stinchcombe</span></span> [<i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326] made clear that
    relevant information in the first party production context includes not only
    information related to those matters the Crown intends to adduce in evidence
    against the accused, but also any information in respect of which there is a
    reasonable possibility that it may assist the accused in the exercise of the
    right to make full answer and defence (pp. 343-44).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police officers’ personal opinions about potential
    jurors are not relevant information relating to the investigation and are
    clearly not evidence to be adduced against the accused.  Finally, such opinions are not “information”
    that will assist the accused in making full answer and defence.  Obviously, some opinions fall comfortably
    within the <i>Stinchcombe/McNeil</i> disclosure regime.  Opinions by experts,
    opinions by witnesses about the identity of the perpetrator and opinions by
    police and lay witnesses about the speed of a vehicle involved in a collision
    are potential evidence, or may assist the accused in the exercise of their right
    to make full answer and defence.  Personal opinions about potential jurors are not.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Appearance of a Miscarriage of Justice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s principal submission on this branch of
    its argument is that the Crown had an unfair advantage in jury selection that potentially
    enabled it to select, not an impartial jury, but a jury that would be biased in
    favour of the Crown.  The appellant submits
    that he need not establish actual bias, merely the appearance of bias.  An examination of what actually occurred in
    this case does not support this submission.  I begin with the “information”.  What Crown counsel received were one-word opinions not based on CPIC or
    any other police data base<i>.</i>  Only 13 of the potential jurors with these
    notations made it past the challenge for cause phase to a point where the
    information would have been useful to Crown counsel.  The usefulness of the information is demonstrated
    by the fact that Crown counsel did not challenge one of the potential jurors
    with a “no” comment and that person became a member of the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The highest the defence can put its case, is that had
    they had the same information as the Crown, they might have exercised their
    peremptory challenges differently.  Speculation
    that the accused might possibly have exercised his peremptory challenges in a
    different way does not establish the appearance that the Crown was able to
    obtain a favourable jury or establish the appearance of a miscarriage of
    justice.  A reasonable and right-minded
    person viewing what occurred realistically and practically would not come to
    the conclusion that the jury appeared biased.  In reaching that conclusion the reasonable person would take into
    account the following.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the information was of limited use to Crown
    counsel.  Second, Crown counsel actually
    disclosed instances where there was a real potential for bias: the brother of
    the deceased’s widow and the juror who expressed an opinion about the
    appellant’s guilt.  Third, there was a
    challenge for cause in which potential jurors were questioned about their
    connection to the police force. Specifically, the trial judge agreed to ask if
    anyone was “closely associated with” a member of the police force or a
    correctional worker, and excused individuals accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, this so-called jury vetting must be put in
    context.  The opinions gathered by Crown
    and defence were all in aid of the exercise of their peremptory challenges.  Even where there has been a challenge for
    cause, as in this case, <span class=GramE>counsel have</span> little more than
    intuition to assist in making decisions about how to exercise their peremptory
    challenges.  In a smaller town, like
    Cobourg, the counsel, the accused and local police officers may have some
    information about the character or reputation of potential jurors, but little
    or no information that could possibly predict how a potential juror would
    act.  Even with the short comments
    provided to the Crown counsel in this case, the exercise of peremptory
    challenges was little more than guess work, guess work that is permitted and
    sanctioned by the peremptory challenge regime.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a case like <i>R. v. Pizzacalla</i> (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 783 (C.A.), where Crown counsel
    deliberately set out to use his stand asides to choose a jury trying a sexual
    assault case, composed entirely of women.  In that case, the way in which the selection process was manipulated by
    Crown counsel gave the appearance that Crown counsel secured a favourable jury,
    rather than simply an impartial one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case is also far removed from <i>R. v. Latimer</i>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217.  As is well known, <i>Latimer</i> concerned the killing by the
    accused of his severely disabled daughter.  In <i>Latimer</i>, Crown counsel and
    the police prepared a questionnaire to be administered to potential jurors
    seeking their views on a number of issues including religion, abortion and
    euthanasia.  The questionnaire was
    administered by the police to 30 of the 198 prospective jurors, either by
    telephone or in interviews at local police stations.  The use of the questionnaire came to light
    while the case was pending in the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and
    ordered a new trial.  Speaking for the
    Court, Lamer C.J. said this at para. 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The actions of Crown counsel at trial, which were
    fully acknowledged by Crown counsel on appeal, were nothing short of a flagrant
    abuse of process and interference with the administration of justice. The
    question of whether the interference actually influenced the deliberations of
    the jury is quite beside the point. The interference contravened a fundamental
    tenet of the criminal justice system, which Lord Hewart C.J. put felicitously
    as &quot;justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly
    be seen to be done&quot;: <i>R. v. Sussex
    Justices</i>, [1924] 1 K.B. 256, at p. 259; also see <i>R. v. Caldough</i> (1961), 36 C.R. 248 (B.C.S.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing of this sort occurred in this case.  Potential jurors were not contacted by the
    police and there was no interference with the administration of justice.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Hobbs</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the oral argument in this case, the Nova
    Scotia Court of Appeal released its decision in <i>R. v. Hobbs</i> (2010), 257 C.C.C. (3d) 411.  We have now received written submissions from
    the parties respecting that decision.  <i>Hobbs</i> is different from the appellant’s
    case.  In <i>Hobbs,</i> Crown counsel asked the police to check both CPIC and other
    police databases for criminal records.  Crown counsel then used this information, which was not disclosed to the
    defence, in the exercise of his peremptory challenges.  On appeal from conviction, the Crown conceded
    that it should have disclosed the information about potential jurors’ criminal
    records.  Not only was no such concession
    made in this case, but I have found that Crown counsel was not required to
    disclose the personal opinions of the police officers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, counsel for the Crown in <i>Hobbs, </i>at para. <span class=GramE>32,</span> conceded “that in two
    instances during the jury selection process the defence exercised its
    peremptory challenges in circumstances where, if it had the undisclosed
    information, there is a reasonable possibility it would have done so
    differently”.  The Nova Scotia Court of
    Appeal drew the inference, based on the Crown’s concessions that if the defence
    had the information “the jury that had the difficult task of weighing the
    evidence of the Crown and defence, and deciding the guilt or innocence of the
    appellant, would have been differently constituted”.  I have been unable to draw that inference in
    this case.  In my view, <i>Hobbs</i> does not assist the appellant. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Yumnu</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this appeal was under reserve, this court
    released its decision in <i>R. v. Yumnu</i>,
    2010 ONCA 637, which concerned jury vetting in a case in Barrie.  The parties were also given an opportunity to
    provide written submissions in response to that decision.  The appellant and respondent recognize that
    the facts in <i>Yumnu</i> are different than
    this case, because in that case the record showed that defence counsel at trial
    knew, or at least ought to have known, that the Crown was in possession of
    information about the criminal records of the potential jurors.  There is no suggestion that defence counsel
    in this case was aware of the inquiries made of the police officers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as counsel for the respondent rightly points
    out, the disclosure obligations recognized in <i>Yumnu</i> arose in a context where the information was gleaned from
    police databases, which is not the case here.  Indeed, the information provided to Crown counsel in this case fits
    within the area of “community intelligence” referred to in <i>Yumnu</i> at para. 76 and which, in my view, is not within the Crown’s
    broad disclosure obligations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The disclosure obligations of the prosecutor are
    well defined. <span class=GramE>Circumscribed, not infinite.</span> <i>Those obligations are not co-extensive with
    the entire storehouse of information, knowledge and experience, in brief the
    stock-in-trade a prosecutor may acquire by exposure to daily appearances in the
    courts and interactions with the police, witnesses, victims and the communities
    at large in their jurisdiction. Equality of knowledge and community
    intelligence</i>, like equivalence in skill and experience as between opposing
    counsel in a criminal trial, <i>is not a
    constitutional requirement</i> or a principle of fundamental justice.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with the appellant that <i>Yumnu</i> supports the view that an informed
    and reasonable observer would believe that the jury, as it was selected in this
    case, was not impartial.  The court in <i>Yumnu</i> at para. 83 said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&nbsp;Essential to the overall fairness of a
    criminal jury trial is a jury that is and appears impartial in their
    determination of the adequacy of the prosecutor's proof. Neither the
    composition nor the conduct of the jury should give rise to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias. <i>The <span
class=GramE>intention of the prosecutor in exercising peremptory challenges, as
    well as the prosecutor's belief about the overall disposition of the jury, are</span> not dispositive of the bias issue. To sustain a claim of a lack of trial fairness
    based on a reasonable apprehension of bias, the composition of the jury must be
    such that it leaves the well-informed observer with a reasonable apprehension
    of bias in favour of the prosecution</i>: <i>R. v. Biddle</i> (1993), 84 C.C.C.
    (3d) 430 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 443-44.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The composition of this jury would not raise a question
    of reasonable apprehension of bias.  I
    have earlier set out the manner in which this jury was selected.  For example, Crown counsel selected a juror
    against whom there was a “no” notation and brought to the court’s attention
    information that suggested actual bias against the appellant by one of the
    selected jurors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
