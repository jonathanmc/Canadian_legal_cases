  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In New York <span
class=GramE>state</span>, retail sales of motor vehicles attract sales
    tax.  The purchaser pays the tax as part
    of the purchase price. The dealer collects the tax for the state, <span
class=GramE>then</span> remits it to the state along with prescribed forms that
    show the details of the sale. Or, at least, that is how things are supposed to
    work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The District
    Attorney in Queen’s County says that Boris Michaelov, a Canadian resident,
    operated two car dealerships in Queen’s County from 2001 until 2005.  Michaelov collected sales tax on retail sales
    of motor vehicles. But, the District Attorney contends, Michaelov did not remit
    to the state the amount of sales tax collected at the dealerships.  Far from it.  And so it is that the United States wants Michaelov returned to New York
    to stand trial on an indictment handed down by a grand jury in Queen’s County.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      A judge of
    the Superior Court of Justice ordered Michaelov committed for surrender to the
    United States.  The Minister of Justice
    ordered Michaelov’s surrender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Boris
    Michaelov says that both the judge and the Minister were wrong in ordering
    committal and surrender. He appeals the committal order and seeks judicial
    review of the Minister’s decision on surrender. In my view, neither the judge
    nor the Minister made any reviewable error.  I would dismiss the appeal and the application for judicial review.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    grounds advanced on appeal and judicial <span class=GramE>review require</span> some rehearsal of the evidence upon which the United States relies, as well as
    a brief summary of the procedural history and the circumstances of Boris
    Michaelov.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Sales Tax on Retail Car Sales in
    the State of New York</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      In
    New York <span class=GramE>state</span>, sales taxes is exigible on retail
    sales of motor vehicles to state residents. The purchaser pays the sales tax.
    The dealer, registered as a sales tax vendor, collects the sales tax. The
    dealer holds the sales tax monies in trust for the state, the deemed owner of
    the funds. The dealer must remit the sales tax collected to the state on a
    periodic basis, together with prescribed sales tax returns.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Retail
    sales of motor vehicles are recorded on a prescribed form, MV-50. The dealer
    records the transfer of the ownership, the retail price and the applicable
    sales tax on the form.  Filing the form
    with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) certifies that the dealer has
    collected all applicable state and local taxes, including the state sales tax.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    dealer completes another form, ST-100, which the dealer remits to the New York
    State Department of Tax and Finance (NYSDTF).  On this form, the dealer records the total of taxable vehicle sales and
    of the taxes collected on those sales. The total sales made and taxes collected
    on the MV-50 and ST-100 forms submitted by the dealer should coincide.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Dealerships</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The
    New York prosecution of Michaelov focuses on two dealerships in Queen’s County:
    Bill Johnston Auto Sales (BJAS) and its successor, Lefferts Auto Sales
    (LAS).  The state alleges that Michaelov
    was the principal in both dealerships.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both
    BJAS and LAS applied for and were granted the authority to collect sales tax on
    behalf of the state of New York by the NYSDTF.  BJAS operated from December 1, 2001 until November 30, 2003; LAS from
    December 1, 2003, until May 31, 2005.  Both dealerships operated out of the same business premises.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            Boris Michaelov and the Dealerships</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From 2001 until 2005, according to an investigator from
    the NYSDTF, Boris <span class=SpellE>Michaelov</span> could not have obtained a
    motor vehicle dealers’ licence in his own name from the state of New York.  His name does not appear in state records as
    the president of either BJAS or LAS. The state authorities allege that he ran
    the dealerships with others, associates who were his nominees, listed as the
    president.  Neither nominee had anything
    of consequence to do in connection with the daily operation of either
    business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Record of the Case (ROC) discloses that Boris
    Michaelov owned the property where both BJAS and LAS were located. The same
    address appears on Michaelov’s New York state driver’s licence.  In a dealer acknowledgement statement filed
    with the DMV for LAS, Michaelov indicated that he had a direct or indirect
    financial interest in the business that he had not previously disclosed. He was
    an authorized representative for LAS at auto auctions and authorized others to
    represent the dealership in a similar capacity. He is alleged to have been the
    primary purchaser of vehicles for both dealerships at automobile auctions,
    often paying for his purchases (which aggregated several million dollars) with
    personal cheques. On one occasion, he paid a civil penalty incurred by BJAS
    with a personal cheque.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Vehicle Sales</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>State
    investigators reviewed various forms filed in Queen’s County by both
    dealerships.  They found a significant
    discrepancy between reported and actual sales.  For BJAS, during the period December 1, 2001, until August 30, 2003, the
    dealership reported total sales on their ST-100 form of $1,450,000.00. The
    actual sales recorded on MV-50 forms exceeded $16,000,000.00. The sales tax not
    remitted was $1,400,000.00.  LAS reported
    sales of $700,000.00, but the MV-50 forms showed actual sales of
    $11,500,000.00.  Based on this
    discrepancy, LAS failed to remit $927,000.00 in state sales tax.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            Michaelov and the Vehicle Sales</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the ROC, the District Attorney links Michaelov to the under-reported sales of
    $28,000,000.00 and under-remitted (but collected) state sales tax of
    $2,300,000.00 by the anticipated evidence of Kimlee Stewart, a criminal auditor
    for the NYSDTF. According to Ms. Stewart, who has reviewed all of the MV-50
    forms submitted by BJAS and LAS, “most of” the forms bear Michaelov’s signature
    as seller.  Filing the form certifies
    that all applicable state and local taxes have been collected by the seller
    from the purchaser.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his affidavit of April 15, 2008, Boris <span class=SpellE>Michaelov</span> denied signing <i>any</i> MV-50 form on
    behalf of BJAS or LAS.  He described Ms.
    Stewart’s opinion as “absolutely false”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    a later affidavit, sworn on October 6, 2008, after counsel for the extradition
    partner at the committal hearing had produced copies of nine MV-50 forms,
    Michaelov acknowledged his signature on two of the forms.  He explained that, as the landlord of BJAS,
    he may have prepared a few MV-50s at the request of the manager “to help his
    employees with their paperwork” while the manager was on vacation. He had
    forgotten about having done so when he had filed his first affidavit.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    ROC includes as exhibits copies of <span class=SpellE>Michaelov’s</span> application for a New York state driver’s licence, his licence and an
    authorization that permits him to buy motor vehicles at auction for LAS.  Each document bears <span class=SpellE>Michaelov’s</span> name and signature.  His signature
    consists of a distinctive mark followed by the name “Boris” in capital
    letters.  The same combination appears on
    several MV-50 forms attached as exhibits to his affidavit of October 6,
    2008.  The similarities in the signatures
    are consistent, obvious and remarkable.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Disclosure Application</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the extradition hearing, Michaelov applied for disclosure of the MV-50 forms
    reviewed by Ms. Stewart.  Counsel for
    Michaelov in New York had sought disclosure of the forms but the District
    Attorney had refused the request. Under the governing procedural statute,
    Michaelov is not entitled to disclosure until after he has been arraigned on
    the indictment handed down by the grand jury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    basis upon which counsel sought disclosure at the extradition hearing was
    twofold. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    Michaelov contended that disclosure was necessary so that he could determine
    whether he could impeach the presumptively reliable contents of the ROC.  His affidavit of April 15, 2008, clothed his
    claim with the necessary air of reality.  In the event that he could demonstrate, by production of the MV-50s,
    that Ms. Stewart’s opinion of his authorship was manifestly unreliable, he
    would be entitled to a discharge at the end of the hearing.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    Michaelov submitted that disclosure of the MV-50s was necessary in order to
    ensure a fair extradition hearing, his constitutional due under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    October 27, 2008, the extradition hearing judge dismissed the application for
    disclosure.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Committal Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 9, 2009, the extradition hearing judge ordered
    Michaelov committed for surrender to the United States authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her reasons ordering committal, the extradition
    hearing judge rejected the argument that the opinion of Ms. Stewart about
    Michaelov’s signature on “most of” the MV-50 forms was inherently unreliable or
    was rendered unreliable because of Michaelov’s qualified denial and the failure
    of the United States to produce the relevant MV-50 forms for inspection and
    analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition hearing judge reviewed the presumptively
    reliable evidence summarized in the ROC, as well as the affidavits submitted by
    Michaelov. She framed the issue for decision as whether the assertion that
    Michaelov signed “most of” the MV-50 forms was so unreliable that it failed to
    meet the standard for committal under s.&nbsp;29(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999,
    c.18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition hearing judge considered the
    distinctive nature of Michaelov’s signature, the number of forms involved
    (thousands) compared to the number located by Michaelov’s American lawyer that
    did not bear Michaelov’s signature (22), and the inconsistencies in Michaelov’s
    affidavits about signing MV-50 forms. She was not prepared to draw an adverse
    inference from the refusal of the United States to produce the MV-50 forms
    because it was not obliged to do so under American law until after
    arraignment.  The evidence, as a whole,
    including evidence about Michaelov’s control of BJAS and LAS that was not
    controverted at the hearing, satisfied the extradition hearing judge that
    committal was warranted on the domestic offences contained in the Authority to
    Proceed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Surrender Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
    for the appellant made written submissions to the Minister. Mr. Gold pointed
    out what he alleged to be errors in the ruling refusing disclosure and in the
    decision on committal. He described Michaelov’s roots in Canada, his family
    situation and several medical conditions that he alleged would make his
    surrender unjust and oppressive.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Minister declined to postpone his decision on surrender until after this court
    had heard and determined the appeal from committal. The Minister noted that the
    correctness of the ruling on disclosure and the decision on committal would be
    determined by this court. The Minister did not consider the health and personal
    circumstances of Michaelov would render his surrender unjust or oppressive,
    thus ordered him surrendered to United States authorities.</span></p>

    Michaelov (the appellant) advances two discrete, yet related grounds of appeal
    against the decision ordering him committed for surrender. The first has to do
    with the correctness of the disclosure ruling and its impact on the fairness of
    the extradition hearing. The second concerns the ability of the ROC to satisfy
    the standard required for an order of committal under s. 29(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)

    including his <span class=GramE>affidavits,</span> the 22 MV-50s not signed by
    him and any adverse inference that could be drawn from the non-production of
    the hundreds, if not thousands of MV-50s, and concluded that the presumptive
    reliability of the contents of the certified ROC had not been dislodged. She
    was entitled to make that finding. Absent an error in the application of the <i>Ferras</i> standard, a misapprehension of
    the relevant evidence or an unreasonable conclusion, her determination is
    entitled to deference.</span></p>

    rejects the suggestion that the Minister’s failure to consider the sufficiency

    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761, at para. 26.  The
    surrender decision of the Minister is a determination to which this court owes

    judicial review it is not for us to reassess the relevant factors and to
    substitute our own view of where the balance falls. What we must do is ask
    whether the Minister considered the relevant facts and reached a defensible
    conclusion, one that falls within a range of reasonable outcomes: <i>Lake </i>at para. 41. The Minister’s
    conclusion is <i>not </i>defensible if he

    recognized that he could refuse surrender where to order it would be unjust or
    oppressive in the circumstances. He noted the submissions of counsel, which
    reiterated his [counsel’s] position before the extradition hearing judge and
    formed the basis of his appeal from committal. The Minister pointed out that
    the correctness of the conclusions of the extradition hearing judge would be
    decided here.  It was in that context
    that the Minister determined that those considerations were not appropriate for
    him to take into account when the appeal was outstanding.  Our affirmation of the conclusions of the
    extradition hearing judge on the disclosure issue, as well as the sufficiency
    and reliability of the ROC confirms the reasonableness of the Minister’s decision.</span></p>
