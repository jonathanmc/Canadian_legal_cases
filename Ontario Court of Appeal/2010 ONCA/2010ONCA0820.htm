  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with several offences arising
    out of an armed robbery.  That robbery
    was committed by three individuals.  It
    was the Crown’s position that the appellant had not participated directly in
    the robbery, but had driven the two perpetrators to and from the scene of the
    robbery in his automobile.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown had a strong circumstantial case.  The appellant testified.  He indicated that he was at a party with the
    two perpetrators on the evening of the robbery in the town where the robbery
    occurred.  He fell asleep for several
    hours.  According to him, while he was
    asleep, the two perpetrators and a third person had used his car unbeknownst to
    him to commit the robbery and then returned to the party.  The appellant and the two perpetrators then
    drove from the party back towards Toronto.  According to the appellant, he had no idea that the robbery had
    occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Dineen, in his able submissions, raises one ground
    of appeal.  He submits that the trial
    judge used the appellant’s exercise of his right to silence when he was
    arrested as a basis upon which to reject the appellant’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was conflicting evidence as to whether the
    appellant in fact did remain silent at the time of his arrest. However, it is
    clear that the trial judge ultimately determined that, apart from giving a
    false name, the appellant did not offer any explanation for his whereabouts
    that evening.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Dineen took the court to Crown’s counsel’s
    submissions at trial.  It would appear
    that the Crown invited the trial judge to take the appellant’s silence upon his
    arrest into account when assessing the credibility of the exculpatory version
    of events testified to by the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having reviewed the trial judge’s reasons, we accept
    Mr. Dineen’s submission.  There are three
    references in the trial judge’s reasons which, in our view, indicate that he
    used the appellant’s silence in assessing the credibility of the appellant’s
    testimony.  Perhaps the clearest of those
    three references is the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>... [I]t is equally incredible that upon being
    placed under arrest by Hueson and told that it was for robbery, he would, if
    innocent as he testifies at this trial, give the officer a false name instead
    of protesting his innocence.  <u>If he
    knew nothing about the robbery because he slept through it, why remain
    silent?  <span class=GramE>Hardly the
    actions of a surprised innocent victim.</span></u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had a constitutional right to remain
    silent.  The use of the appellant’s
    silence as a basis upon which to reject his trial testimony is offensive to the
    fundamental right to silence.  It can
    only be characterized as a serious error in law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown, however, submits that the curative proviso
    can be applied because of the overwhelming nature of the case.  The Crown submits that on this evidence, a
    reasonable trier of fact, acting judicially, could only have convicted the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s case was indeed a strong one.  The evidence established the following:</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and the two perpetrators of the
    robbery were together on the evening of the robbery, before the robbery, in the
    town where the robbery occurred.  They drove
    there together in the appellant’s car. </p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The two perpetrators and a third unidentified
    person were in the appellant’s car at the scene of the robbery, during the
    robbery and drove away from the robbery in the appellant’s car.</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>About 20 minutes after the robbery, the
    appellant and the two perpetrators were seen driving toward the highway in the
    appellant’s car.  The appellant and the
    two perpetrators were pulled over a few minutes later by the police.  Property stolen in the robbery and the guns
    used in the robbery were found in the appellant’s car.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the very strong circumstantial evidence,
    it must be said that the appellant’s evidence was far from credible.  The version of events given by the appellant
    was, on its face, implausible.  His
    evidence was replete with inconsistencies.  The appellant also gave the police a false name when he and the
    perpetrators of the robbery were pulled over by the police shortly after the robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the strength of the Crown’s case and
    the obvious weaknesses in the appellant’s exculpatory evidence, we are
    satisfied that no reasonable trier of fact could have come to any verdict other
    than guilty on the charges.  Consequently, and despite the serious error committed by the trial
    judge, the curative proviso can be applied.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
