  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Felteau was charged with uttering a threat to cause
    bodily harm and several breaches of his bail orders and his probation
    terms.  All of the offences related to a
    threat allegedly made by Mr. Felteau against Ms. “G”, his former probation
    officer, through Mr. Gemmell, a mental health care worker.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted Mr. Gemmell’s evidence that Mr.
    Felteau told him he was going to follow Ms. G and “assault” her.  The trial judge also found that Mr. Felteau
    uttered the threat intending to intimidate or assault Ms. G.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further held that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The only thing that Mr. Felteau threatened to do
    was to follow and then assault Ms. G.  That does not necessarily include bodily harm.  He thus must be found not guilty on count number
    1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals from the acquittal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept Ms. Wassenaar’s submission that the
    determination of whether an utterance made in specified circumstances
    constitutes a threat to do bodily harm is a question of law:  <i>R. v.
    Baptista</i> (2008), 238 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 14.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also accept her submission that the determination of
    whether the threat constituted a threat to do bodily harm must be made by
    considering how a reasonable person in the circumstances would construe the
    utterance.  The circumstances give meaning
    to the specific words uttered:  <i>R. v. McCraw</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 758 at
    paras. 26-27.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not consider the surrounding
    circumstances in deciding whether the threat to “assault” Ms. G. was a threat
    to do bodily harm to her.  Instead, he
    looked at the word “assault” in isolation from the circumstances and found it
    to be ambiguous as to the nature of the proposed assault.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the trial judge’s findings, the context relevant to
    the meaning of the threat included the following:</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Felteau was fixated upon Ms. G. and had very
    recently been convicted of harassing her;</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Felteau was angry with Ms. G. when he made
    the threat.  He blamed her for his arrest
    and detention.  Someone had apparently
    stolen his belongings while he was in jail;</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Felteau has a violent history, including
    acts of serious violence directed at women;</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Felteau was mentally unstable;</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Felteau had apparently consumed cocaine all
    that week, including on the morning that he made the telephone call;  and</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Felteau indicated to Mr. Gemmell that he was
    on his way to assault Ms. G. when he terminated the conversation.  He led Mr. Gemmell to believe that he was in
    the courthouse where Ms. G.’s office was located.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the circumstances outlined above, none of
    which were in issue by the end of the trial, a reasonable person could only conclude
    that Mr. Felteau, an angry unstable person with a lengthy criminal history, was
    on his way to find and hurt Ms. G., a person whom he had victimized a short
    time earlier and whom he blamed for his latest predicament.  A threat to “assault” made in those
    circumstances constitutes a threat to cause bodily harm to Ms. G.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s appeal must succeed.  The acquittal will be set aside and a
    conviction entered.</p>
  <h3>The Appropriate Sentence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When this court enters a conviction, it can impose
    sentence or remit the matter to the trial court.  We think this is an appropriate case for this
    court to sentence Mr. Felteau on the conviction on the charge of threatening
    bodily harm.  In doing so, we take into
    account the outcome of his appeal in C52189.  In that appeal, Mr. Felteau appealed his convictions on two counts of
    breaching his recognizance and three counts of breaching his probation
    orders.  He also appealed the sentences.  The trial judge had determined that an
    appropriate sentence was one of 18 months.  After giving Mr. Felteau credit for 190 days spent in custody prior to
    sentencing, the trial judge imposed a sentence of 349 days.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court dismissed Mr. Felteau’s appeals.  Our task is to impose an appropriate sentence
    on the conviction for threatening to cause bodily harm that takes into account
    the sentences imposed on the other charges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave careful reasons for sentence.  Although he had acquitted Mr. Felteau on the
    charge of threatening bodily harm, he did find that Mr. Felteau had threatened
    Ms. G.  He took that finding into account
    in determining the appropriate sentences for the breaches of the court
    orders.  That threat constituted the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of
    those breaches.  Of course, in taking the
    threat into account, the trial judge did not consider, as we must, that the
    threat was one to do bodily harm.  The
    nature of the threat is an aggravating factor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In imposing sentence, the trial judge reviewed Mr.
    Felteau’s background.  He had a lengthy
    criminal record which included many failures to comply with court orders.  The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Obviously, any prospects of rehabilitation are
    virtually <span class=GramE>nil</span>.  The protection of the community by removal of the accused from society
    is the dominating principle of sentencing that applies in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts before the trial judge, the dim picture
    painted by him was accurate.  We have,
    however, received two additional reports from the same doctor whose report was before
    the trial judge.  That material outlines
    Mr. Felteau’s post-sentence progress in the provincial institution.  It offers some, albeit guarded, reason to think
    that Mr. Felteau’s future prospects have improved.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A threat to do bodily harm to anyone is a serious
    matter.  It is particularly serious when the
    threat is addressed to someone in the position of Ms. G.  Probation officers must know that where
    crimes are committed against them in the course of their duties, the justice
    system will take those crimes seriously.  In our view, the further conviction on the charge of threatening bodily
    harm against Ms. G. would normally have warranted a sentence of six months in
    addition to the 18 months imposed on the other charges.  However, based on the fresh evidence which
    indicates that Mr. Felteau has improved prospects for rehabilitation, we would
    impose the same sentence (349 days) for the threatening bodily harm charge as
    Mr. Felteau received on the other charges.  The sentences should be served concurrently.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal by the Crown is allowed, the
    acquittal on the charge of threatening bodily harm is set aside, and a
    conviction is entered.  Mr. Felteau is
    sentenced to 349 days on that charge.  The sentence is to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed on
    the other counts in the information.  </p>
