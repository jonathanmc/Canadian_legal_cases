style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants appeal the order of Justice Roberts dated February 10, 2010 that the
    appellants provide the respondents with an executed release in the form
    attached to the respondents’ Notice of Application. That order was an ancillary
    part of a broader order removing the respondents as bare trustees of interests
    in certain lands of which the appellant Dalewood Economy Limited was the
    beneficial owner. Dalewood had instructed the respondents to convey the lands
    to the appellant Meadowvale Land Limited.  Apprehensive that they might face tax liability personally, the respondents
    had refused to convey the lands unless the appellants first provided a release
    in the requested form.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    the application judge, the appellants’ position seems to have been that
    Meadowvale was under no obligation to execute and provide any release in favour
    of the respondents. There was no issue that Dalewood, as the beneficiary of the
    trust, was bound by the trust agreement, which contained terms releasing and
    indemnifying the trustees from all responsibility with respect to the
    management and use of the lands. The application judge found that in the
    particular circumstances of the case there was good reason to require
    Meadowlands to provide the release.  She
    went on to state that the form of release and indemnity sought by the
    respondents was “essentially no different” from the release and indemnity
    provisions in the trust agreement. She went on to observe that “The only
    express difference in my view is the requirement that Meadowvale, as well as
    Dalewood, execute the release and indemnity.” Consequently, she ordered the
    form of the release delivered by the respondents to be executed and provided by
    both appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal the appellants did not contest that part of
    the order requiring Meadowvale to provide a release. Rather, they argued that
    the respondents were entitled only to be released in the terms set out in the
    trust agreement. They submitted that as the respondents’ draft release was
    broader than the terms of the trust agreement, they should not be required to
    provide it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondents’ counsel agreed that, generally, trustees
    are not entitled to demand a release as a precondition to the execution of
    their trust duties. However, he submitted that in this case the trust agreement
    entitled the trustees to a release, and the release drafted by the respondents
    simply implemented the intention of the trust agreement. We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted the trust agreement released the respondents “from all responsibility with respect to the
    management and use of the lands” and “in connection with the Lands or out of
    the Trustee being registered on title as owner of the Lands”. On the other
    hand, the release requested by the respondents released them as
    transferors from all claims “whatsoever” “in connection with their being or
    acting as bare trustees of the Lands or otherwise”.  It went on to indemnify them in respect of
    all claims made against them “in any capacity whatsoever”. We have no doubt
    that the requested release is broader in scope than the release provided by the
    trust agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside para.
    5 of the application judge’s order and replace it with an order that both
    appellants execute and deliver to the respondents a release and indemnity in
    the terms set out in the trust agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the fact that the argument regarding the
    scope of the draft release does not appear to have been raised in the same way
    on the motion below, there will be no costs of the appeal.</p>
