    Geddes group paid for the shares by providing two promissory notes (the “promissory

    position that the purported acceptances were not made in accordance with the
    offers in its notices and therefore were not valid.  Both the offer to purchase and the offer to sell
    in the notices provided that 100 percent of the purchase price was to be paid
    on closing.  The Geddes group’s
    acceptances provided only for a payment of at least 50 percent of the purchase
    price in cash or by certified cheque or bank draft on closing together with a
    promissory note for the balance of the purchase price.  The Harris group took the position that,
    because the payment terms in the acceptances were not in accordance with the
    payment terms in its offers, the acceptances were not valid.  Thus, the Harris group asserted that the
    Geddes group was required to sell its shares to the Harris group pursuant to s.
    4.12(3) of the shareholders agreements.  </span></p>

    accepted by providing for the payment of “at least 50.0% of the Purchase Price
    in cash or by certified cheque or bank draft” on completion and “a promissory
    note for the balance” containing the terms set out in s. 412(2)(c).  The acceptances in this case were valid

    the issue of whether the Geddes group’s acceptances were valid.  </span></p>

    acceptances were not valid.  The

    provide for payment of 100 percent of the purchase price on completion.  She held that, in effect, the acceptances
    were counter offers. </span></p>

    require more than 50 percent of the purchase price to be paid in cash, by
    certified cheque or bank draft on completion.  Implicitly, the application judge rejected the Geddes group’s argument
    that s. 4.12(2) sets out the terms that are deemed to be included in an
    offer.  </span></p>

    standard of review in this appeal is one of correctness.  I accept their position.  In my view, the Geddes group’s submission
    that the application judge erred in the interpretation of s. 4.12 involves a
    review of how the legal principles relating to contractual interpretation were
    applied and does not involve a consideration of any factual findings.  As such, this court should review the
    interpretation of the shareholders agreements using a standard of correctness.</span></p>

    factual matrix.  The purpose of the
    interpretative exercise is to determine the meaning of the contract in an
    objective sense, by asking what the parties using the words in the contract
    against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to
    mean:  <i>Dumbrell v. The Regional Group of Companies Inc.</i> (2007), 85 O.R.

    confronted with the interpretation of a buy-sell provision in a commercial
    contract.  I agree with the observation
    of the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>942925
    Alberta Ltd. v. Thompson</i> (2008), 47 B.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 1, at para. 21

  <h3>(b)  Application to this Case</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The interpretation question is
    whether s. 4.12(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>c) sets out the minimum payment
    terms for a buy-sell offer or instead sets out the actual terms that form part
    of that offer.  If the former, the party
    triggering the buy-sell clause has flexibility when it comes to setting the
    payment terms for its offers.  The party
    may provide for payment of between 50 and 100 percent of the purchase price in
    cash, by certified cheque or by bank draft, with any balance payable by a
    promissory note.  On the second
    interpretation, s. 4.12(2) deems the payment provisions of para. (c) <span
class=GramE>to</span> be included in the terms of an offer.  It would therefore not be open to a
    triggering party to provide for another means of payment inconsistent with the
    terms set out in para. (c)<span class=GramE>.  Put</span> another way, the payment terms in para. (c) <span

    include them.  Put another way, the lettered
    paragraphs in s. 4.12(2) are mandatory terms that must be either expressly

    4.12(2), para. (c) <span class=GramE>is</span> deemed to be a “Term” of an

    the Offeror’s shares, is obliged to pay at least 50 percent of the purchase
    price on closing and the balance by way of a promissory note with the terms set
    out in the paragraph.  Pursuant to the
    language of para. (c), the Offeree is entitled to pay more than 50 percent on
    completion if it so chooses, but it is not required to do so.  </span></p>

    out the minimum standard for an offer.  At a minimum, an offer must require at least 50 percent of the purchase
    price to be paid on closing.  Under this
    interpretation, the Offeror has the option of requiring more than 50 percent to
    be paid on closing.  In this case, the
    Harris group required 100 percent payment on closing.  The problem with this argument, as I see it,
    is that it is inconsistent with the words used in the section.  It fails to take into account the
    introductory language which says “the Terms shall be deemed to provide”.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An offer shall provide the amount of the Purchase Price
    that shall be paid on completion by way of cash, promissory note or bank draft,
    provided that such amount is not less than 50% of the Purchase Price.  The balance, if any, shall be paid by way of

    is significant.  Under the Harris group’s
    interpretation, an Offeror is entitled to require payment of between 50 and 100
    percent on completion.  Under the Geddes
    group’s interpretation, an Offeree cannot be required to pay more than 50
    percent on completion.  In my view, the
    language of the section favours the latter interpretation.</span></p>

    interpretative exercise.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    which this court should have regard in interpreting s. 4.12.  </span></p>

    of s. 4.12(2) that flows from the language used in the shareholders agreements
    leads to a result that is commercially reasonable.   That interpretation avoids the very
    situation that arose in this case whereby the Harris group would be able to
    purchase the Geddes group’s shares without paying any money unless the Geddes
    group was able to pay close to $3 million within 90 days in order to purchase
    the Harris group’s shares and pay the amounts owing under the promissory notes.  In my view, it is not commercially
    unreasonable to interpret s. 4.12(2) in a manner that, at least to some extent,
    levels the buy-sell playing field between the parties.</span></p>

    the triggering shareholder, it could only make an offer that conformed to the
    shareholders agreements.  The Harris
    group’s offers were deemed to include the payment terms set out in s. 4.12(2<span

    entitled to be put in the position it would have been in had the sale been
