  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the decision of Justice
    Corbett of the Superior Court of Justice allowing her husband’s application for
    an order pursuant to the Hague Convention that their daughter <span
class=SpellE>Zoha</span> be returned to the United Kingdom.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hague Convention stipulates that a dispute about a
    child’s custody and access should be determined by the courts in the state
    where the child is habitually resident, not by the courts of the state<a
name="_GoBack"></a> to which a child may be taken or retained. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that <span
class=SpellE>Zoha’s</span> habitual residence was the United Kingdom.  Therefore, pursuant to the Convention, the
    dispute about her custody of <span class=SpellE>Zoha</span> had to be
    determined by the courts there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, this court does not consider cases and
    decide them anew.  Rather, in order for
    this court to interfere with the decision of the application judge, the
    appellant must show that he applied the law incorrectly or made a palpable and
    overriding error in finding the facts.  She has demonstrated neither. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of a child’s habitual residence is
    essentially a question of fact.  <span
class=SpellE>Zoha</span> was born and lived in the U.K. until her parents came
    to Canada on September 3, 2009, on one-way airline tickets.  A few days later, the couple had a major
    disagreement.  The father returned to the
    U.K., while the mother remained in Canada with <span class=SpellE>Zoha</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the application judge, the mother’s evidence was
    that the parties had come to Canada with the settled intention to stay
    here.  The application judge was
    satisfied by her evidence that the parties may have been planning on relocating
    to Canada at some time, but he went on to find that they had never given up
    their residence in the U.K. at the relevant time.  In deciding to reject the mother’s evidence
    and accept the father’s, the application judge relied on the factual
    circumstances surrounding the trip to Canada.  Those factual circumstances were consistent with the parties maintaining
    their home in the U.K.  For example, when
    the parties came to Canada the father had no immigration status to live in
    Canada and the family’s belongings had been left in their residence in the U.K.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the record containing the factual
    circumstances surrounding the parties’ trip to Canada provided ample support
    for the application judge’s rejection of the mother’s evidence and his
    conclusion that <span class=SpellE>Zoha</span> remained habitually resident in
    the U.K. at the time of the trip to Canada.  His conclusion does not reflect the application of a reverse onus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother submits that the application judge, on his
    own motion, should have required oral testimony before resolving the
    conflicting evidence. She relies on this court’s comment in <i>Cannock v. <span class=SpellE>Fleugel</span></i>,
    [2008] O.J. No. 4480, that a court may find it necessary to hear oral testimony
    in a rare and exceptional case involving s. 13(b) of the Hague Convention.
    Noting that s. 13(b) is not invoked in this case, we are satisfied that it was
    appropriate for the motion judge to decide it on the existing record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the appellant’s unilateral steps to
    settle <span class=SpellE>Zoha</span> in Canada does not undermine the
    application judge’s conclusion in the least.  Under the Convention, it is the child’s habitual residence “immediately
    before any breach of custody or access rights” that matters.  Nor is there any basis on which we would
    interfere with the application judge’s discretionary decision not to apply s.
    12 of the convention.  The application
    judge’s findings on which he based his discretion were open to him on the
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the mother did not put forward any evidence
    that would credibly raise the potential application of s. 13 of the
    Convention.  We were not persuaded that
    the application judge erred by failing to construe the father’s return to the
    U.K after the parties disagreement as acquiescence to the child’s retention in
    Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to his costs fixed
    at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
