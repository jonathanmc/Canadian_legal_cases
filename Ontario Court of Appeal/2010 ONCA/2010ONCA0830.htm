  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since July 1, 1893, concealing the dead body of a child
    has been an indictable offence in Canada.  The definition of the offence has always declared it to be immaterial
    whether the child died before, during or after birth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 18, 2008, a judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice decided that the words “died before … birth” in s. 243 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> are unconstitutionally
    vague.  In the result, he severed the
    preposition “before” from the section, leaving it to read in its material part
    “whether the child died during or after birth”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor acknowledged that he could not establish
    either the cause or the time of death, thus he offered no evidence in support
    of the allegation contained in the indictment.  The trial judge acquitted Ms. Levkovic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal requires us to determine whether the trial
    judge was correct in his conclusion that the “before birth” reference was
    unconstitutionally vague.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that I will develop, I am satisfied that
    the offending phrase “before … birth” is neither unconstitutionally vague nor
    otherwise constitutionally infirm. I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    acquittal and order a new trial.</p>

'>[1]</span></span></span></a> underlying the prosecution and its procedural history can be stated in brief terms.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The
    Discovery of the Body</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    April 5, 2006, an apartment building superintendent in Mississauga was cleaning
    a recently-vacated apartment unit.  He
    noticed an abandoned bag on the balcony.  At first, he thought that the bag contained wet rags that he could
    simply toss down the garbage chute.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    superintendent felt something inside the bag. He opened it and looked.  Wrapped in towels was the lifeless body of a
    “baby”.  The superintendent called the
    police. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The
    Post-mortem Findings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Advanced
    decomposition of the body precluded optimal pathological assessment.  The body was that of a female child at or
    near a full-term gestation.  The
    pathologist could not determine the cause of death, or whether the child had
    died before, during or after birth.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The
    Acknowledgement of the Respondent</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    April 9, 2006, after extensive media coverage of the superintendent’s
    discovery, the respondent went to a local police station. There, in a highly
    emotional state, she acknowledged that the child was hers. In a later police
    interview, the respondent said that she had fallen while alone in the
    apartment. The baby was born there.  She
    put the baby in the bag and left the bag on the balcony.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The
    Procedure Followed</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to a count that alleged that
    she:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…
    within a two hundred and forty eight day period, last, past and ending on or
    about the 5<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2006 at the City of Mississauga in the
    Central West Region, unlawfully did dispose of the dead body of a child with
    intent to conceal the fact that she had been delivered of it by concealing it
    on the property of 285 North Service Road, Mississauga, contrary to section 243
    of the Criminal Code of Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Immediately
    after arraignment and plea, the constitutional challenge to s. 243 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>began.  The prosecutor adduced no evidence.  Defence counsel made no admissions. The
    respondent had waived the preliminary inquiry. There, the prosecutor undertook
    not to pursue any suggestion that the deceased child had been born alive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    constitutional challenge proceeded under ss. 7 and 15 of the <i>Charter</i>. Among the deficiencies
    identified in s. 243 were overbreadth and vagueness.  The respondent sought a declaration of
    invalidity to the extent of the breach and dismissal of the indictment because
    it failed to allege an offence known to law.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE RULING OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge gave lengthy reasons.  He
    rejected the challenge under s. 15, as well as the claim of overbreadth under
    s. 7.  But he concluded that the
    respondent’s s. 7 interest, which was implicated by the prospect of
    imprisonment on conviction, was breached because of the vagueness of the
    phrase, “child died before … birth”, in the section.  In the result, the trial judge severed the
    word “before” from s. 243.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Attorney General contends that the trial judge erred in concluding that the
    reference “child died before … birth” was unconstitutionally vague and in
    granting the remedy of severance for the infringement.  The Attorney General seeks a determination of
    constitutionality and an order for a new trial.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the outset of the hearing of this appeal, the parties skirmished about the
    extent of the appellant’s reliance on reports of several prosecutions at the
    Old Bailey in London for infant homicide and concealment of birth.  The appellant also complained about the
    adequacy of the factual record in the Superior Court and about the judge’s
    decision to let the challenge proceed in the absence of any evidence, agreed
    statement of facts or applicable admissions. The issues are related and require
    determination before the constitutional integrity of s. 243 may be approached.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The
    Preliminary Issue: The Adequacy of the Factual Record</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    the parties had finished their submissions before the trial judge, but before
    he had rendered his decision on the constitutional issue, researchers in
    England released online reports of nearly 200,000 cases tried at the Old
    Bailey, the Central Criminal Court in London, between 1674 and 1913.  Among the reported cases were many involving
    prosecutions for infant homicide and for concealment of birth.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Among
    the several Books of Authorities the appellant has filed for use on this appeal
    are two volumes of “Old Bailey cases”.  These materials, which were not provided to the trial judge, are relied
    upon to demonstrate the “actual workings of the English Criminal Law”.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant says that the reports of the Old Bailey cases reveal several features
    about the origins and application of the concealment offence. These features
    are of service in demonstrating errors in the analysis and ultimate conclusion
    of the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant points out that the Old Bailey cases negate any link between the
    concealment offence and the former crime of abortion, thus rebut any suggestion
    that the abortion cases can inform the content of the concealment offence or
    that the concealment offence was enacted to buttress the crime of abortion.
    Further, the authorities demonstrate that the concealment offence was <i>not</i> enacted to punish women for having
    sex outside the bonds of marriage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
    to the appellant, these authorities reveal that juries were eager to acquit
    young women of both child homicide and concealment of birth on virtually any
    pretext.  Accidental death and lack of
    proven “disposal”, “concealment” or birth were frequently successful defences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    the authorities make it clear that investigations of and prosecutions for the
    concealment crime invariably include case-specific medical evidence and at or
    near full term children.  In the event of
    conviction, the sentences imposed tend to be either non-custodial or short-term
    imprisonment dominated by rehabilitative sentencing principles.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the result, the appellant says, these authorities indicate the very limited
    role the phrase “child died before … birth” has had in the operation of the
    provision, thereby the error in its use to found a determination of
    unconstitutionality.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent takes no issue with reliance upon the Old Bailey cases as persuasive
    legal precedent, but resists the more expansive use that the appellant seeks to
    make of them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the outset, the respondent points out that the authorities upon which the
    appellant relies are edited reports.  They rehearse the arguments advanced and record the conclusion of the
    court, usually a trial judge, but contain minimal reference to the evidence
    adduced at trial.  They cannot form the
    basis for judicial notice, nor can they be utilized as adjudicative, social or
    legislative facts in the determination of the constitutional issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    the appellant’s more general complaint that the trial judge was wrong to
    proceed with the constitutional challenge in the complete absence of evidence,
    the respondent reminds us that the prosecutor at trial was content to proceed
    on this basis.  It follows, the
    respondent submits, that the appellant, absent an application to adduce fresh
    evidence, must take the record as it exists and ought not to be permitted to
    expand it indirectly by attempting to make evidentiary use of the Old Bailey
    cases.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    preliminary issues raised in this case invite recall of the principles
    governing the extent of factual foundation required to determine the
    constitutionality of legislation and those that define the limits of judicial
    notice.  </span></p>

    judge released his reasons in response to the constitutional challenge.  The prosecutor gave a brief summary of the

    is well-settled that, as a general rule, a trial judge is entitled to reserve
    judgment on any application made at the outset of trial proceedings until the
    end of the case.  In other words, the
    judge may decline to rule on the application until all the evidence has been
    heard: <i>DeSousa</i> at p. 954.  The decision whether to rule on the
    application at the outset, or to await the introduction and conclusion of the
    evidence, rests within the discretion of the trial judge: <i>DeSousa</i> at p. 954. </span></p>

    policy that discourages adjudication of constitutional challenges without a
    factual foundation and the policy that enjoins fragmentation of criminal
    proceedings by interlocutory proceedings that take on a life of their own: <i>DeSousa </i>at p. 954.  Both of these policies favour disposition of
    the application at the end of the evidence in the case: <i>DeSousa </i>at p.&nbsp;954.  A

    is the reality in many <i>Charter</i> challenges that the social or legislative facts are likely to prove
    dispositive:  <i>Spence</i> at para. 64.  While
    the limits of judicial notice outside the realm of adjudicative facts are
    inevitably somewhat elastic, the application of the doctrine, which dispenses
    with the need for formal proof of facts that are clearly uncontroversial or
    beyond reasonable dispute, is not unprincipled: <i>Spence</i> at para. 63; <i>R. v.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    is also worth reminder that simply labelling an issue as one involving a
    “social fact” or a “legislative fact” does not afford a court <i>carte</i> <i>blanche</i> to put aside the need to examine the trustworthiness of the
    “facts” sought to be judicially noticed.  Neither may counsel bootleg “evidence in the guise of authorities”: <i>Spence </i>at para. 58; <i>Public School Boards’ Association of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney
    General)</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 845, at para. 3.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant advanced a tepid submission that the trial judge erred in embarking
    on the constitutional challenge to s. 243 without a satisfactory evidentiary
    foundation for the claim.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the authorities that insist upon an adequate factual foundation to ground a
    constitutional challenge recognize equally that the general rule is not
    inflexible or intolerant of exception in individual cases: <i>DeSousa</i> at p. 954; <i>Mills </i>at
    para. 38.  To some extent, the nature of
    the challenge advanced, the interest at stake and the likelihood or
    improbability that the evidence to be adduced at trial would assist the
    resolution of the issue are of importance in determining whether the immediate challenge
    will be permitted or determined: <i>DeSousa </i>at
    p. 955; <i>Mills </i>at para. 41.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    counsel at trial agreed on the procedure followed.  To be more specific, the prosecutor did not
    ask the trial judge to reserve his decision on the constitutional challenge
    until the conclusion of the evidence adduced at trial.  Nor did counsel for the respondent at trial
    suggest that evidence should have been heard or an Agreed Statement of Facts be
    filed to provide a factual foundation or context for the challenge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    the challenge here was directed principally at the language of the
    offence-creating provisions.  The liberty
    interest implicated was the prospect of imprisonment on conviction.  The flaw alleged was that the prohibition was
    overbroad and void for vagueness, <i>not</i> as it applied to the respondent, but in its general operation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    as it turned out, when the prosecutor summarized his evidence after the trial
    judge’s ruling, what could have been established may not have advanced the
    inquiry into constitutionality significantly at all events.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Old Bailey Authorities and Judicial Notice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    that judicial notice should be taken of certain social or legislative facts, the
    submission is misplaced.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    we apply the requirements of judicial notice less stringently to the admission
    of legislative facts than to adjudicative facts, we must nevertheless proceed
    cautiously to take judicial notice, even as “legislative facts”, of things that
    are reasonably open to dispute, particularly when they relate to matters that
    could be dispositive of the challenge: <i>Danson</i> at p. 1099; <i>R. v. Find</i>, [2001] 1
    S.C.R. 863, at paras. 48-49; <i>R. v.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    court may equip itself to take judicial notice of some material fact that is
    capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to readily available
    sources of indisputable accuracy: <i>Find</i> at para. 48; <i>Spence </i>at para. 53.  I have been unable to find any precedent,
    however, to support a claim that “readily accessible sources of indisputable
    accuracy” include incomplete or edited reports of prior judicial proceedings.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    permit prior judicial precedent to ground a claim of judicial notice of an
    adjudicative or legislative fact in a later prosecution would permit a party,
    in effect, to sidestep the traditional rules governing the introduction and
    testing of evidence, to dilute the standard required for judicial notice of
    facts and to substitute precedent for proof.  This use of authority harkens back to the protest of Mahoney J.A. in <i>Canada</i> <i>(Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor</i>,<i> </i>[1987] 3 F.C. 593 (C.A.), at p. 608 against “bootlegging evidence

    Old Bailey cases are of persuasive value as legal precedents.  They may assist in elucidating the essential
    elements of the concealment of childbirth offence and in attributing meaning to

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal complaint of the appellant is that the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge described the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence of s. 243 as disposal of the remains of a child after birth or
    delivery. He concluded that the terms “birth” and “delivered”, as used in the
    section, did <i>not</i> include compelled
    child-birth at any stage of gestation by an induced abortion.  Concealment of pregnancy was not part of the <i>actus reus.</i>  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
    to the trial judge, the legislative purpose underlying the enactment of the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the trial judge, the critical issue was whether the term “child”, as it applied
    to the period before birth, provided an intelligible standard in that it gave

    it avoided the potential for arbitrary enforcement.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge bemoaned the absence of expert evidence about fetal viability,
    medical consensus about the meaning of live birth and of the ability of

    notice.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    prosecutor.  He noted that the degree of

    before birth” rendered the provision void for vagueness according to the trial
    judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    conclusion of the trial judge seems rooted in three paragraphs of his lengthy
    reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[212]   Although flexibility of interpretation and
    application of statutory terminology is not necessarily synonymous with
    vagueness, and recognizing the critical role of the judiciary in interpreting
    legislators’ intent, I am unable to determine from the record in this case, the
    respondent’s submissions, or review of the history of s. 243 and its
    predecessor enactments, a coherent, unambiguous meaning of “child” in the
    context of death before birth.  In these
    circumstances, in my view, it is for Parliament, not the courts, to decide the
    appropriate definitional interpretation.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[213] Albeit in a different context, the words of
    Wilson J. in <i>Morgentaler</i>, at 563, are
    apposite here – this is a matter best left to “the informed judgment of the
    legislature which is in a position to receive guidance on the subject from all
    the relevant disciplines”.  A legislature
    could of course prohibit the disposition of product of <i>any</i> still or life-birth with the concealment intent, or define “the
    standard for prohibited conduct in terms of gestational age” (<i>Fitzpatrick</i>, at 571) using a conclusive
    or rebuttable presumption respecting the fetus’ capacity for live-birth. Or, as
    in s. 223(1), a definitional attempt of ‘chance of life’ could be crafted
    narrowing the ambiguity attaching to the interpretation of the commencement
    point for post-natal life.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[214]   In
    the result, the applicant has established that the impugned words are
    unconstitutionally vague and therefore inconsistent with the principles of
    fundamental justice already reviewed.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The
    Positions of the Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that the trial judge applied the
    wrong test for vagueness.  He substituted
    a more onerous standard than the law requires. The threshold for finding a
    statutory provision void for vagueness is very high. The only provisions that
    warrant a finding of unconstitutionality on this ground are those that are
    truly unintelligible.  Section 243 is not
    so lacking in precision that it fails to provide sufficient guidance for legal
    debate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the appellant’s position that to provide fair
    notice of an area of risk does <i>not</i> require absolute precision in the language used. What is essential is that the
    statute provide reasonable notice to persons that their conduct approaches an
    area of risk. But the trial judge demanded more. He seems to have concluded
    that the offence-creating provision was unconstitutionally vague because <i>he</i> could not determine a coherent,
    unambiguous meaning for “child” in the context of a death that occurred before
    the child was born.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the terms of s. 243 also
    permit fair enforcement of the prohibition. The language used consists principally
    of readily definable terms that identify an area of risk. They include a fault
    element. That medical experts may be required to assist in determining whether
    a prosecution should be undertaken is not an indicium of vagueness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further faults the trial judge for
    failing to take into account the <i>mens rea</i> component of the offence in determining whether the allegation of
    unconstitutional vagueness should prevail. Its inclusion clarifies the reach
    and limits the effect of the prohibition, ensuring that inadvertent breaches
    are not criminal nor is conduct undertaken in good faith within the
    prohibition’s sweep.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in his
    approach to an application of the “chance of life” standard of <i>R. v. Berriman</i> (1854), 6 Cox C.C.
    388.  The trial judge should have
    received expert evidence on the viability issue and not relied on decisions in
    dated abortion cases to conclude that viability was a medical not a legal
    concept. He failed to analyze <i>Berriman</i> on its own merits and as a legal test.  In the result, the trial judge’s conclusion that the physical maturity
    test of <i>Berriman </i>was unworkably vague
    reflects error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine whether the phrase “child died before ...
    birth” is unconstitutionally vague requires consideration of several factors
    including the purpose of the provision, the governing legal principles, the
    operation of the law in practice, the surrounding statutory provisions and the
    policies underlying the vagueness doctrine.  This analysis compels the conclusion that s. 243 is not
    unconstitutionally vague.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent says that the trial judge got it right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the respondent argues, her liberty and
    security interests were implicated in two different ways. Not only may a
    conviction result in a sentence of imprisonment, but her personal autonomy, as
    a female, to make fundamental life choices, including whether to disclose the
    natural end of her pregnancy, implicated her liberty interest under s. 7.  The dual nature of her s. 7 interests affected
    is a contextual factor affecting the vagueness analysis and one that demands
    greater, rather than lesser precision in the language of the prohibition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the appellant’s reliance on <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> as a factor negating what is otherwise a hopelessly vague
    statute is misplaced. The offending language is a component of the <i>actus reus</i>. Vagueness in the <i>actus reus</i> of necessity spills over to <i>mens rea</i> because of the requirement that
    an accused’s conduct be intentional, wilfully blind or reckless with respect to
    the elements of the <i>actus reus</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent takes issue with the appellant’s
    complaint about the failure of the trial judge to receive any evidence on the
    challenge.  The prosecutor at trial,
    together with the appellant’s trial counsel, agreed to proceed in the absence
    of the evidence.  The trial judge had the
    authority to require the parties to adduce evidence, but no one asked him to do
    so.  He can scarcely be faulted for
    proceeding with the challenge in accordance with the positions of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent says that the trial judge treated <i>Berriman</i> as a legal test. He examined
    whether s. 243, as interpreted through <i>Berriman</i>,
    provided a basis for coherent judicial interpretation and identified a solid
    core of meaning.  He found the results of
    the analysis inherently ambiguous, thus impermissibly vague.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent also takes issue with the appellant’s
    reliance on police, prosecutorial and judicial discretion as factors in the
    vagueness analysis.  It is no answer to a
    claim of vagueness that charges may not be laid, prosecuted or result in
    convictions. None of these factors respond to the impermissible vagueness of
    the statutory language.</p>

    mean that it is unconstitutionally vague.  What is crucial is whether a court examining the provision can give
    sensible meaning to its terms: <i>Prostitution

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    an offence need not be codified in statutory form to survive a vagueness
    challenge, although statutes may tend to provide greater precision than the
    ever-evolving common law: <i>United Nurses

    inclusion in a statute of a term that has been the subject of debate and
    conflicting views as used in predecessor statutes does not render the provision
    void for vagueness, at least where the legislature has sufficiently delineated
    the area of risk and the terms of the debate: <i>Canada v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606,<i> </i>at p. 657.</span></p>

    its scope is reasonably delineated so that legal debate can occur about the
    application of the provision to the peculiar circumstances of an individual

    its frequent engagement by litigants who mount constitutional challenges,
    vagueness has been rarely applied by courts to strike down federal or
    provincial legislation. The governing principles have been narrowly defined,
    essentially rejecting vagueness where judicial interpretation of the provision
    is possible: <i>R. v. Lindsay </i>(2009),
    245 C.C.C. (3d) 301 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 22; <i>Canadian Pacific </i>at para. 79. The threshold for the application of

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    their very nature, laws must cover myriad sets of circumstances. This acknowledgement
    of the self-evident or intuitive grasp of the obvious, makes it impossible to
    draft laws that precisely foresee each case that might arise. The situation is
    further complicated by the ambiguity and imprecision inherent in almost any

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To imbue the rule against vagueness with some content,
    it is perhaps best to return to the core values the rule protects: fair notice
    to citizens and corresponding limitations on law enforcement discretion. A law
    is unconstitutionally vague if it fails</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.          to
    give <i>fair</i> <i>notice</i> about the conduct prohibited by the law; or</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What seems clear from the authorities is that the
    constitutional standard of precision that the vagueness doctrine demands cannot
    be very exacting. We cannot require a law to ascend to a standard of precision
    to which neither its subject-matter nor the language in which it is expressed
    lend themselves: <i>Nova Scotia
    Pharmaceutical Society</i> at pp. 606, 642; <i>Ruffo
    v. Conseil de la Magistrature</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 267, at paras. 111-12. We do
    not and cannot require absolute certainty or laboratory precision: <i>Prostitution Reference </i>at pp. 1122 and
    1156.  Just because the law may be open
    to more than one interpretation does not offend vagueness principles: vagueness
    is only constitutionally terminal if the law cannot, even with judicial
    interpretation, provide meaningful standards of conduct: <i>Prostitution Reference </i>at pp. 1157-1161; <i>Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</i> at pp. 606 and 626-27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not enough to engage the vagueness doctrine that
    a provision is subject to interpretation, or that there are cases that will
    land close to the line: <i>Cochrane v.
    Ontario</i> <i>(Attorney General)</i> (2008), 92 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at para. 38.</p>
  <h4>Overbreadth</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overbreadth is a discrete ground upon which a law may
    be constitutionally unsound. It is related to vagueness because both
    overbreadth and vagueness emanate from a common source – a lack of legislative
    precision in the means used to accomplish the legislative objective: <i>R. v. Heywood</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761, at
    p. 792; <i>Lindsay</i> at para. 16.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overbreadth refers to a law that restricts liberty more
    than is necessary to accomplish its purpose.  Overbreadth is established only where the adverse effect of the
    legislation on individuals subject to it is grossly disproportionate to the
    state interest that the legislation seeks to protect or achieve: <i>Lindsay </i>at para. 21; <i>Heywood</i> at p. 792.  The “grossly disproportionate” standard
    accords substantial elbow room to the legislature’s assessment of the risk to
    public safety and the need for the law under siege: <i>Lindsay </i>at para. 21; <i>Malmo-Levine </i>at para. 143; <i>Cochrane</i> at para.

lang=EN-US>The test that <i>Berriman</i> proposes, a chance of life standard, marks the outer
    boundary of when a foetus becomes a child for the purpose of the concealment
    offence at common law. Under <i>Berriman</i>,
    for a foetus to become a child, the foetus must have reached a period when, but
    for some accidental circumstances, such as disease, it might have been born
    alive.  The standard is one of
    viability.  Under <i>Berriman</i> a foetus becomes a child when it reaches a stage in its
    development from which it might grow into a human being, given proper care.</span></p>

    which the time of death in relation to birth is unclear, a foetus becomes a

    some external event or other circumstances, it would likely have been born

lang=EN-US>To determine whether the disposal

    circumstances.  In the usual course, the
    trier of fact’s decision will be informed by expert medical evidence about the
    course of the pregnancy, fetal age and viability, and the cause of death. In
    some instances, there may also be evidence about the conduct of the child’s
    mother and others during the course of the pregnancy and at times
    contemporaneous with the death of the child. The examples given are intended as

lang=EN-US>The trial judge concluded that part
    of s. 243 was void for vagueness because he could not determine a coherent

lang=EN-US>Neither the <i>Charter</i> nor the vagueness doctrine require that the statute provide
    absolute certainty in its application by the language it uses.  Legal rules only provide a framework, a
    behavioural guide. They do so by approximation, by delineating a risk zone. We
    can expect no more of them. Certainty is achieved only where the law is
    actualized by a competent authority: <i>Nova
    Scotia Pharmaceutical Society </i>at p. 638.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Language is not a scientific
    instrument, an exact tool.  It cannot be
    argued that an enactment can and must provide enough guidance to predict the
    legal consequences of any given course of conduct in advance, else it be
    shunted to the sidelines, a constitutional casualty.  An enactment must enunciate some boundaries,
    which create an area of risk: <i>Nova Scotia
    Pharmaceutical Society</i> at p. 639.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Section 243, guided by the
    principles described in <i>Berriman</i> in
    the present context, lays down an area of risk that gives fair notice to
    persons of the boundaries of criminal liability and limits the discretion of
    police in enforcing the legislation.  We
    must be wary of using the doctrine of vagueness to prevent or impede state
    action in furtherance of valid social objects, by requiring a law to ascend to
    a level of precision to which its subject-matter fails to lend itself: <i>Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</i> at p.
    642.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The portion of s. 243 upon which the
    trial judge focused here cannot be uprooted from its context and subjected to
    microscopic scrutiny. This offence requires proof of <i>knowledge</i> of the character of the subject-matter disposed of, the
    dead body of a child, together with a <i>purpose</i>,
    or ulterior intention, of concealment of the birth. It is one of several
    offences, fatal offences against the person, that enjoin conduct that causes or
    contributes to the death of another.  A
    provision that renders investigation of death less difficult forms an integral
    part of this statutory scheme.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>It is also worth reminder that a
    crime consists of an <i>actus reus</i> and a <i>mens rea</i>.  Each may have several components.  To determine whether the definition of a
    crime is impermissibly vague requires a consideration of the enactment as a
    whole, including its <i>mens rea</i>. It is the
    provision as a whole that must define an area of risk, provide fair notice and
    curtail law enforcement discretion, not each individual noun, adjective,
    adverb, verb or preposition.  And that,
    in my view, s. 243 does.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected the
    respondent’s claim that inclusion of the words “child died before … birth”
    rendered s. 243 constitutionally infirm on the basis of overbreadth.  Although the submission was not pressed in
    argument before us, I agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge. The
    inclusion of the impugned words does not overshoot the purpose of the
    prohibition by including within it conduct beyond what is necessary to achieve
    the purpose for which the section was enacted. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I am satisfied that the trial judge
    erred in striking out the word “before” in s. 243 on the ground of vagueness
    when it was used in the clause “the child died before … birth”.  Section 243 is not void for vagueness in this
    or in any other respect.</p>
