  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant, Mr. Chidley-Hill, appeals from a summary judgment dismissing part of
    his action against the respondents for damages for defamation. The <span
class=GramE>respondents</span> cross-appeal, claiming that the motion judge
    erred in failing to dismiss the appellant’s action in its entirety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant is a lawyer who acted as counsel for Triple 3 Holdings Inc., 3 Pizzas
    3 Wings Limited, 3 For 1 Pizza &amp; Wings (Canada) Inc., company president,
    Reza Solhi, and another corporate officer, Farzad Bagherzadeh, in an action in
    which franchisees of the Triple 3 companies obtained judgment against the
    companies and corporate officers for improperly and fraudulently terminating
    their franchise and reselling it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In March
    2005, the trial judge, Paisley J., found the appellant jointly and severally liable
    with his clients for solicitor and client costs of the action totalling $140,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In holding
    the appellant personally responsible for the costs of the action, the trial
    judge relied on the fact that, although not a defendant in the action, the
    appellant was a vice-president of one of the Triple 3 companies. The trial
    judge concluded that the appellant “shared a common financial interest ... with
    the defendants” and “had placed himself in conflict with his duty to the Court
    and to his clients, as he was unable to advise the clients as to their exposure
    to liability in this case, and the advantage of settling it, without admitting
    his own.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Four months
    later, on July 12, 2005, the Toronto Star published an article written by the
    respondent, James Daw, entitled “Judge moves to aid pizza franchisees”. The
    first part of the article focussed on a recent decision of Farley J. to appoint
    an inspector to oversee one of the Triple 3 companies as a result of complaints
    by franchisees that company president Solhi was undermining their stores and
    assisting a rival chain directed by his mother. The article also stated that
    Mr. Solhi had been charged with 25 counts of fraud over $5,000 relating to the
    sale of franchises. The last five paragraphs of the article reported on the
    costs ruling made by Paisley J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On September
    7, 2006, this court allowed the appellant’s appeal of Paisley J.’s costs award
    against him, holding that the finding of a common financial interest was
    palpably wrong and that the appellant was not in a conflict of interest with
    his duty to his client or the court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On September
    12, 2006, the Toronto Star published an article written by Mr. Daw relating to
    the Court of Appeal decision. The article was entitled “Toronto lawyer
    vindicated in cost award case”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On October
    11, 2005, the appellant commenced his action claiming damages against the
    respondents for defamation in relation to the July 12, 2005 article. As noted
    by the motion judge on the summary judgment motion, the heart of the
    appellant’s claim is found in paras. 17-20 and 29 of the amended statement of
    claim:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17. The Article as published on July 12, 2005 and
    displayed on July 12, 2005 was defamatory of Chidley-Hill. It contained the
    following words:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“....Justice James Farley of the Superior Court of
    Justice has appointed an inspector to oversee 3 for 1 Pizza &amp; Wings (Canada)
    Inc., whose founder has lost several civil lawsuits and been charged with fraud
    in the sale of franchises.....”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“....Solhi faces 25 counts of fraud over $5000
    related to the sale of franchises, mainly to new Canadians. A preliminary
    hearing into the criminal charges was set to resume last month, but was
    adjourned until September 9....”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Solhi told the franchisee’s lawyer, Gregory Sidlofsky,
    during a prehearing examination....”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“.... Farley found that Solhi ‘was incredibly evasive
    to even the simplest relevant questions put to him....”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“In an unusual development last March, a judge
    agreed to make one of Solhi’s lawyers jointly liable for $140,000 in legal
    costs”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Justice Victor Paisley made the ruling several
    months after awarding Sidlofsky’s client Jaffer Jan, $594,000.00. He had ruled
    that Solhi and Bagherzadeh had fraudulently locked the Dutch immigrant out and
    sold his 3 for 1 Pizza franchise.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Paisley said in his ruling on legal costs that 3
    for 1 Pizza had hired John Chidley-Hill as its vice-president and general counsel
    on July 11, 2001. He was to receive $160,000 a year, a private office, a luxury
    sedan and 1 per cent of money received from franchise sales and 10 per cent
    from franchise transfers.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Paisley said Chidley-Hill “stood to gain from his
    clients’ wrongdoing as it occurred, and while he was obligated to advise them
    as to their legal responsibilities.” That put him in <span class=GramE>a
    conflict</span>, said Paisley. Chidley-Hill would have had to admit his own
    liability if he had advised Solhi to settle with Jan.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Chidley-Hill has asked the Court of Appeal for
    Ontario for leave to appeal. A ruling is expected soon.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>18. The Article as published and displayed had the
    effect of linking Chidley-Hill to Solhi and the 25 counts of fraud faced by
    Solhi. This aggravated Chidley-Hill’s damages. The entire Article will be put
    in evidence at the trial of this proceeding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>19. The Article as published and displayed had the effect
    of linking Chidley-Hill to Solhi’s fraudulent termination of Jaffer Jan’s
    franchise as found by Justice Paisley. This aggravated Chidley-Hill’s damages.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>20. Particularly damaging to Chidley-Hill was the
    defendants’ published and displayed statement in the Article:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“...Chidley-Hill would have had to admit his own
    liability if he had advised Solhi to settle with Jan.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The said statement damaged Chidley-Hill. It
    impugned his professional integrity. It had the effect of aggravating
    Chidley-Hill’s damages.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>29. In consequence of
    the words published and displayed, Chidley-Hill <u>was portrayed in a manner
    that would damage his credibility by creating the impression that Chidley-Hill
    would put his own interests ahead of those of his client</u>. He has been
    seriously damaged, and he has suffered distress and embarrassment. <span

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Motion Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Before the
    motion judge, the respondents’ primary submission was that the allegedly
    defamatory words contained in the July 12, 2005 article were true or
    “justified”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the motion judge, to support their claim
    of justification, the respondents submitted that an exception to the
    “repetition rule” exists in the case of reports of an allegation or claim published
    by newspapers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The repetition rule provides that if a person communicates
    an unadopted rumour, he or she cannot justify it – or say that it is true –
    merely by proving that the rumour existed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the respondents submitted that an exception to
    that rule exists where repeated statements relate to findings by a court
    published in a newspaper – in such a case, the defendant need only prove that
    the court made the finding that was repeated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge rejected this argument, holding that
    the authorities relied on by the respondents do not stand for the proposition
    that a newspaper can justify a report of allegations or claims in a court
    proceeding by proving that the allegations were made. If that were the case,
    the law of privilege in relation to fair and accurate reports of judicial
    proceedings would be redundant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the motion judge determined that, at its
    core, the respondents’ argument was an assertion of privilege. Relying on that
    assumption, the motion judge found that the last five paragraphs of the July
    12, 2005 article were entitled to the benefit of common law privilege.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although neither party had done so, in his ruling on
    the summary judgment motion, the motion judge divided the words of the July 12,
    2005 article quoted at paragraph 17 of the appellant’s statement of claim into
    two categories: (i) the Cost-Order Words, which were the last five paragraphs
    of the quoted portion of paragraph 17 of the amended statement of claim (and the
    last five paragraphs of the July 12, 2005 article, which described Paisley J.’s
    costs ruling); and (ii) the Non-Cost Order Words, which were the remaining
    paragraphs of the quotation in paragraph 17. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge noted that, unlike s. 4(1) of the <i>Libel and Slander Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.12,
    common law privilege does not require that the words be published
    contemporaneously with the judicial proceedings to which they relate. On the
    facts of this case, the motion judge concluded that the Cost Order Words
    contained “a very fair and accurate summary” of the costs endorsement of Paisley
    J. Moreover, he concluded that the appellant had not alleged malice and that no
    other objection raised by the appellant to the application of common law
    privilege applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the Non-Cost Order Words, the motion judge observed
    that the respondents relied on only one basis for their request that the action
    be dismissed, namely, that the words complained of were true. He concluded that
    it was implicit in that tactical position that the words complained of referred
    to the appellant and defamed him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he acknowledged that the defamatory meaning of
    the Non-Cost Order Words was not pleaded as clearly as it could have been, the
    motion judge concluded that a fair reading of paragraphs 17 and 18 of the
    statement of claim indicates that the appellant is alleging that, when coupled
    with the Cost Order Words included in the same article, the Non-Cost Order
    Words linked the appellant “to Solhi and the 25 counts of fraud faced by Solhi”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the respondents had adduced no evidence to
    demonstrate that the appellant was in fact linked to the fraud charges faced by
    Solhi, and given his conclusion that it was implicit in the respondents’
    position on the motion that the words complained of referred to the appellant
    and defamed him, the motion judge concluded that there was a genuine issue for
    trial concerning whether the Non-Cost Order Words were defamatory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge therefore granted summary judgment
    dismissing the appellant’s claim for damages for defamation in relation to the
    Cost Order Words but dismissed the motion for summary judgment in relation to
    the Non-Cost Order Words.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the motion judge erred in
    artificially <span class=GramE>bifurcating</span> his claim against the
    respondents and further erred in holding that the respondents are entitled to
    the benefit of common law privilege.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept the appellant’s submission that the motion
    judge erred in bifurcating his claim. However, we reject his submission that
    the motion judge erred in holding that the respondents are entitled to the
    benefit of common law privilege. Accordingly, in the unusual circumstances of
    this case, we conclude that the appellant’s appeal must be disposed of under s.
    134(1) and (5) of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, by ordering that the motion judge’s order be set
    aside and that the appellant’s action be dismissed in its entirety. In the
    result, it is unnecessary that we address the cross-appeal or the issue of our
    jurisdiction to address the cross-appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant advanced a distinct claim for
    defamation against the respondents based on the Cost Order Words alone, he advanced
    an additional claim for defamation based on the linkage between the Cost Order
    Words and the Non-Cost Order Words. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in our view, the motion judge erred in
    bifurcating the appellant’s claim and holding that the Costs Order Words were entitled
    to the benefit of common law privilege while at the same time holding there was
    a genuine issue for trial concerning the Non-Costs Order Words.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said<span class=GramE>,</span> we reject the
    appellant’s submission that the motion judge erred in holding that the respondents
    were entitled to the benefit of common-law privilege. At para. 11 of his costs
    endorsement, Paisley J. said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Chidley-Hill acted as counsel and vice
    president for the defendants, who acted in common, at the time that the abusive
    transactions...occurred, and as counsel at trial. He shared a common financial
    interest at that time with the defendants. He could not have been acting in an
    independent position when he stood to gain from his clients’ wrongdoing as it
    occurred, and while he was obliged to advise them as to their legal
    responsibilities. He had placed himself in conflict with his duty to the Court
    and to his clients, as he was unable to advise the clients as to their exposure
    to liability in this case, and the advantage of settling it, without admitting
    his own.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a plain reading of para. 11, we agree with the
    motion judge’s conclusion that the Cost Order Words reflected a fair and
    accurate report of Paisley J.’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the appellant acknowledged in his pleadings
    that the portion of the July&nbsp;12, 2005 article that focused on Farley J.’s
    decision is entitled to the benefit of the statutory privilege contained in s.
    4(1) of the <i>Libel and Slander Act</i>. He
    also acknowledged that the portion of the article that refers to the pending
    charges against Solhi is substantially correct. The only error in that report
    is the fact that one of the fraud charges was for fraud under $5,000.00 as
    opposed to fraud over $5,000.00.<i> </i>At
    para.&nbsp;13.38, of <i>Gatley on Libel and
    Slander</i>, 11<sup>th</sup> ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008) the author
    writes that “[i]f the whole report is a substantially accurate account of what
    took place, the fact that there are a few slight inaccuracies or omissions is
    immaterial”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The viability of the appellant’s claim therefore turns
    on whether coupling the report of the fraud charges against Solhi with a report
    of Paisley J.’s decision was capable of bearing a defamatory meaning in
    relation to the appellant – a question of law<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>.
    In our view, it was not. The fact that a lawyer is reported as having acted for
    a client who is alleged to have committed crimes is not reasonably capable of
    amounting to an allegation that the lawyer is somehow linked to the crimes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, nothing in the report of Paisley J.’s decision
    was capable of linking the appellant to fraud charges pending against Solhi.
    Paisley J.’s decision suggested that the appellant was in a conflict of
    interest in acting as counsel in a particular action because he had a financial
    interest in the corporate clients and stood to gain from specific conduct of
    his client in wrongfully terminating and reselling a particular franchise based
    on the appellant’s financial interest in the client corporations. However, it
    did not link the appellant to the client’s fraudulent conduct and it was not
    capable of linking the appellant to any conduct of Solhi underlying the fraud
    charges pending against him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the respondents denied the claim in para. 18
    of the amended statement of claim that the Article linked the appellant to the
    fraud charges against Solhi and denied that the words were capable of bearing a
    defamatory meaning, we conclude, respectfully, that the motion judge erred by
    treating the defamatory meaning as admitted for the purposes of the motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we reject the appellant’s argument that
    the motion judge erred in holding that the respondents are entitled to the
    benefit of common law privilege. Implicit in our conclusion, is a finding that there
    is no genuine issue for trial concerning whether the Non-Cost Order Words are
    capable of bearing a defamatory meaning when coupled with the Cost Order Words.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the trial judge’s conclusion that
    there was no genuine issue for trial concerning whether the July 12, 2005
    report was published with malice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing in these reasons should be taken as commenting
    on the motion judge’s reasons concerning justification.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed,
    the motion judge’s order is set aside and the appellant’s action is dismissed.
    Costs of the appeal are to the respondents on a partial indemnity scale fixed
    in the amount of $7,500 inclusive of applicable taxes and disbursements. No
    order as to costs of the cross-appeal. Costs of the motion and the action are
    to the respondents on a partial indemnity scale fixed in amount of $20,000
    inclusive of applicable taxes and disbursements. </p>
