  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Dr. Walter Pezuk, appeals from the
    judgment of Eberhard J. of the Superior Court of Justice dated April 22, 2010
    in which she concluded that (1) the respondent, Allandale Community Development
    Corporation (“ACDC”), has title in fee simple to Part 1 of the subject lands;
    (2) ACDC has title to Part 15 of the subject lands, subject to the possessory
    claim of Dr. Pezuk; and (3) a trial is required to determine whether Dr.&nbsp;Pezuk’s
    possessory claim to Part 15 is statute barred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also seeks leave to appeal from Eberhard
    J.’s decision dated August 5, 2010 in which she awarded costs to ACDC fixed at
    $77,931.67.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to Part 15 of the subject lands, the
    appellant contends that the application judge erred by declining to decide the
    limitation issue on the record before her. He says that he was not aware of the
    transfer of these lands from CN to the respondent until the summer of 2002. He
    submits that, pursuant to ss. 4 and 5 of the <i>Real Property Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L. 15, this was the
    first act of dispossession that challenged his deed to the property acquired in
    1981 and that, therefore, he had ten years from the summer of 2002 to make his
    claim.  He filed his Statement of Claim
    in December 13, 2007, within this period, and indeed within a six year period
    if that is the correct limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. In our view, the
    application judge appropriately exercised her discretion to decline to
    determine the discoverability issue in the absence of a trial as to whether the
    claim is barred on the ground it was brought outside the limitation period.  The summer of 2002 is not the only date in
    play on the discoverability issue.  The
    appellant received his deed in 1981.  In
    1996, the lands ceased to be used for railway purposes.  The appellant took no steps to claim a
    reversionary interest.  Arguably, the
    appellant became aware in 1996 of the possible sale of the railway lands.  Arguably, the appellant knew in 1997 that a sale
    to the respondent was possible.  In 1999,
    CN sold the lands to the respondent.  All
    of these dates and events, when set against the appellant’s simple assertion
    that he did not know of the respondent’s claim to the lands until 2002, clearly
    pose what the application judge described as “credibility issues bearing on the
    determination of the applicability of the Limitations issue as to whether or
    not Pezuk is out of time in asserting a possessory interest in part 15”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to Part 1 of the subject lands, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in concluding that an agreement
    between Andrew Cunio and the Toronto Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway
    Company (the predecessor to CN) in 1870 was effective in transferring title to
    the railroad.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. Assuming that the
    appellant’s title even includes the reversionary interest he claims, the
    application judge noted that a good deal of the relevant historical
    documentation was lost.  She carefully
    reviewed the conduct and activities of the original parties to the 1870 agreement
    and their successors.  That evidence
    established, as the application judge found, that there was known compliance
    with the legislation all along the railway line. Until Dr. Pezuk 130 years
    later, no one challenged the railway title.  We cannot say that the application judge erred by concluding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So, in summary to this point, I find the Railway
    did acquire title to lands as predicted by the description of the Cunio
    agreement, not by that agreement, since the Railway didn’t insist on the deed
    it could have demanded, but through exercise of legislated powers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant contends that the application
    judge erred by awarding costs to the respondent prematurely (because the
    limitation issue has not been determined) and in an excessive amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  Although the limitation issue remains to be
    decided, several other important issues were determined with finality in the
    respondent’s favour.  There is no reason
    to delay a costs award with respect to those issues.  Nor do we see any basis for quarrelling with
    the quantum of costs awarded by the application judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of
    the appeal fixed at $31,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
