  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on this appeal is whether, under s. 18 of the
    new <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002,
    c. 24, Sch. B, a person who has been sued for damages by a plaintiff and who
    wishes to bring a cross-claim against a concurrent tortfeasor for contribution
    and indemnity, may bring the claim at a time when the plaintiff’s claim against
    the concurrent tortfeasor is statute barred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to January 1, 2004, by virtue of s. 8 of the <i>Negligence Act, </i><span class=bold>R.S.O.
    1990, c.&nbsp;N.1</span>, which section was repealed by the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, a defendant who
    was originally sued by the plaintiff could make a claim against a concurrent
    tortfeasor for contribution and indemnity, despite the passage of the relevant
    limitation period precluding the plaintiff from suing the concurrent tortfeasor,
    as long as the contribution claim was brought within one year of the original
    judgment and appropriate notice was given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that s. 8 was enacted in 1948 to
    address the state of the law at that time, which it submits was that a claim
    for contribution and indemnity could only be made against a concurrent
    tortfeasor who, at the time of the claim, could have been liable to the
    plaintiff, i.e. where the claim was not statute barred. The appellant submits
    that s.&nbsp;18 of the new <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>, by its wording, does not have the same effect as s.&nbsp;8 of
    the <i>Negligence Act</i> and, whether
    deliberately or inadvertently, the legislature has now removed the effect of s.
    8. The result, it submits, is that the law on the issue has reverted to what it
    was before 1948.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the conclusion reached by the motion judge
    that s. 18 of the new <i>Limitations Act,
    2002</i> effectively replaces s. 8 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> with a new two-year limitation period, but with the same legal effect.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge described the relevant facts briefly
    as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On July 22, 2002, a
    severe storm blew down the walls of a new school gymnasium being constructed
    for the Plaintiff School Board by the various Defendants.  The gym was re-built after the storm and the
    Defendant Truax provided some ongoing engineering services that were concluded
    on February 19, 2003.  At that time, s. 46(1)
    of the <i>Professional Engineering Act</i> provided for a 12 month limitation period in relation to any action for damages
    arising from the provision of engineering services.  The limitation period ran from the date on
    which the service was provided. Accordingly, the limitation period expired at
    the latest on February 19, 2004.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Prior to that date, the new <i>Limitations Act 2002</i> came into force on January 1, 2004. It
    repealed s. 46 of the <i>Professional
    Engineering Act</i>. It also contains transitional provisions that apply to the
    Plaintiff’s claim. In particular, s. 24(5) provides that if the claim was
    discovered before January 1, 2004, and if the former limitation period did not
    expire before January 1, 2004, then the former limitation period (such as the
    one under the <i>Professional Engineering
    Act</i>) still applies.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Plaintiff’s action
    was not commenced until June 23, 2008, long after the former s. 46 limitation <span
class=GramE>period</span> had expired. The Defendants’ various cross-claims,
    seeking contribution and indemnity, were then brought within the 2&nbsp;year
    limitation period provided for such claims in ss. 18, 5(2) and 4 of the new <i>Limitations Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge therefore dismissed the defendant’s
    motion for summary judgment that sought to have the action dismissed as statute
    barred.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issue on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Can a cross-claim for contribution and indemnity
    exist when the person from whom contribution is sought is no longer liable in
    law to the plaintiff because the plaintiff’s claim against that person is
    statute barred? Or is it sufficient that that person was potentially liable to
    the plaintiff at one time?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i>, enacted in 1930, creates the statutory obligation of joint and several
    liability of concurrent tortfeasors to a plaintiff, as well as the statutory
    right of contribution and indemnity among concurrent tortfeasors. Section 1
    provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>s. 1  Where damages have been caused or contributed
    to by the fault or neglect of two or more persons, the court shall determine
    the degree in which each of such persons is at fault or negligent, and, where
    two or more persons are found at fault or negligent, they are jointly and
    severally liable to the person suffering loss or damage for such fault or
    negligence, but as between themselves, in the absence of any contract express
    or implied, each is liable to make contribution and indemnify each other in the
    degree in which they are respectively found to be at fault or negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> is procedural and allows parties to make claims for contribution and
    indemnity against persons who were not made party to the action by the
    plaintiff. Section 5 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=verdana>s. <span
class=GramE>5  Wherever</span> it appears
    that a person not already a party to an action is or may be wholly or partly
    responsible for the damages claimed, such person may be added as a party
    defendant to the action upon such terms as are considered just or may be made a
    third party to the action in the manner prescribed by the rules of court for
    adding third parties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of the Act allows claims for contribution and
    indemnity to be brought or continued following settlement with the plaintiff by
    one tortfeasor. Section 2 provides: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>s. 2  A tortfeasor may recover
    contribution or indemnity from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued
    have been, liable in respect of the damage to any person suffering damage as a
    result of a tort by settling with the person suffering such damage, and
    thereafter commencing or continuing action against such other tortfeasor, in
    which event the tortfeasor settling damage shall satisfy the court that the
    amount of the settlement was reasonable, and in the event that the court finds
    the amount of the settlement was excessive it may fix the amount at which the
    claim should have been settled.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of contribution and indemnity is to provide
    a mechanism to ensure that all those who caused or contributed to the
    plaintiff’s loss or damage should share the financial responsibility for that
    loss. Therefore, the basis of the claim is that each person who is held liable to
    the plaintiff for all or part of the loss is also liable to contribute or is
    entitled to receive contribution proportionally to or from the other
    tortfeasors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 8 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> was added in 1948, following the decisions in two cases, <i>Cohen v. McCord</i>, [1944] O.R. 568 (C.A.) and<i> Magee v. Canada Coach Lines Ltd.,</i> [1946] O.W.N. 73 (Ont. H.C.). In <i>Cohen</i>,
    the plaintiff settled with the defendant McCord during the trial, which
    continued to judgment against the defendant Cohen. Cohen elected not to maintain
    his claim for contribution in the original action but, following judgment, he
    commenced a new action against McCord for contribution and indemnity. The court
    held that the proper interpretation of s. 2(1) (now s. 1) of the <i>Negligence Act</i>, together with the
    section that allows for joinder of parties (s. 5), was that all claims for
    contribution were to be brought in one action. The headnote encapsulates the
    holding of the Court of Appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That statute [The Negligence Act], in
    addition to creating the right [to contribution and indemnity], provides a
    method for its enforcement, by bringing in other persons who are or may be
    wholly or partly responsible, either as party defendants or as third parties,
    in an action brought by the injured person. It is clearly the intention of the
    legislation that all issues between such persons shall be litigated in one
    action, and it follows that this means of enforcing the right to contribution
    and indemnity is exclusive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A limitation problem arising out of the application of
    the <i>Cohen</i> interpretation came before
    the Master the next year in <i>Magee</i>.
    The plaintiff was injured in a bus accident and initially sued the bus company,
    the driver and the Municipality. He later discontinued the action against the
    Municipality and served a jury notice on the other defendants. The defendants
    then moved to set aside the Notice of Discontinuance on the basis that its
    effect was to deprive them of the ability to claim contribution and indemnity
    in the action because the limitation period for suing the Municipality had
    passed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue before the Master was whether he could revive
    the action against the Municipality to allow the other defendants to claim
    contribution and indemnity in the plaintiff’s action. Otherwise, because of the
    passage of the one-year limitation contained in the <i>Municipal Act</i>, <span class=verdana>R.S.O. 1937, c. 266,</span> the
    court accepted that a new claim for contribution and indemnity was barred by
    the passage of time. The Master noted that provision had been made in the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, <span
class=verdana>R.S.O. 1937, <span class=GramE>c</span>. 288</span> to allow
    claims for contribution and indemnity to be brought in the case of fatal
    accidents after the expiry of the normal limitation period, but no similar
    provision was contained in the <i>Negligence
    Act</i>. He also referred to another unforeseen problem that arose as a result
    of the decision in <i>McCord</i>: under the <i>Municipal Act</i>, an action against a
    municipality could not be tried by a jury. The Master determined that the court
    had no power to correct the law and dismissed the defendants’ motion even
    though the result was anomalous and created hardship for the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The explanatory footnote to the enactment of s. 8 of
    the <i>Negligence Act</i> two years later
    refers to the problem created by the shorter limitation period for actions
    against municipalities under the <i>Municipal
    Act</i>, and it appears clear that the section was enacted to overcome the
    unanticipated consequences of the decisions in <i>Magee </i>and <i>Cohen</i>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 8 provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>s. <span
class=GramE>8  Where</span> an action is
    commenced against a tortfeasor or where a tortfeasor settles with a person who
    has suffered damages as a result of a tort, within the period of limitation
    prescribed for the commencement of actions by any relevant statute, <i>no proceedings for contribution or indemnity
    against any other tortfeasor shall be defeated by the operation of any statute
    limiting the time for the commencement of action against such other tortfeasor
    provided</i>,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       <span
class=GramE>such</span> proceedings are commenced within one year of the date
    of the judgment in the action or the settlement, as the case may be; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       <span class=GramE>there</span> has been
    compliance with any statute requiring notice of claim against such tortfeasor.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new section did three things: (1) it made the claim
    for contribution and indemnity an action that could be brought in separate
    proceedings after judgment against, or settlement by a tortfeasor in the main
    action; (2) it enacted a one-year limitation period, subject to certain
    conditions; and (3) it allowed the contribution claim to be brought
    notwithstanding the passage of the limitation period that would have applied to
    a claim by the plaintiff against the other tortfeasor, had one been brought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this appeal, counsel for the appellant reviewed both
    English and Canadian cases, including a recent decision of this court in <i>HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. v. Davies,
    Ward &amp; Beck </i>(2005)<span class=canliicitation>, 74 O.R. (3d) 295, and
    argued that the case law </span>establishes that, without the saving words in
    s. 8, no cross-claim could be brought where the plaintiff’s potential claim
    against the proposed concurrent tortfeasor had expired. He submits that this result
    preserves the integrity of the limitation regime by ensuring that, once the
    relevant limitation period had passed in respect of an incident, a party who
    could potentially have been called to account for any conduct that caused or
    contributed to the plaintiff’s damages arising from the incident, but who had
    not been sued, could rest assured that there was no further risk of liability
    arising from the incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent reviewed essentially the
    same case law, including both <i>HSBC</i> and another recent decision of this court, <i>Placzek v. Green</i> (2009)<span class=GramE><i>,</i><span
class=hit>307</span></span><span
class=hit> D.L.R. (4th) 441. </span>However, counsel for the respondent argues
    that these cases establish that, regardless of s. 8, as long as the plaintiff at
    one time had a potential claim against the proposed defendant to the
    cross-claim, the fact that the claim had become statute barred had no effect on
    the ability of a defendant to bring a claim for contribution and indemnity
    against that person. In support of the correctness of this position, he points
    to the fact that this result accords with logic and fairness because it would
    be an unfair result for a concurrent tortfeasor to be prevented from seeking
    contribution and indemnity from another concurrent tortfeasor simply because
    the plaintiff had elected not to sue the second tortfeasor in a timely way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason the appellant seeks to go behind s. 8 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>, is because he argues
    that when s. 8 was repealed by the new <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i> in 2004, and replaced by s. 18 of that Act, s. 18 only replaced
    the first and second components of  s. 8:
    a new limitation period and a new commencement date, but does not re-enact the
    third component: allowing the claim for contribution to be brought after the
    expiry of the limitation period that applied to the action that could have been
    brought by the plaintiff directly against the party from whom contribution is
    claimed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is not necessary to resolve the question
    raised by the appellant as to whether, at the time it was passed, s. 8 was
    necessary in order to allow claims for contribution and indemnity to be brought
    against a concurrent tortfeasor after the expiry of the limitation period that
    governed the plaintiff’s claim against the concurrent tortfeasor. Certainly the <i>Magee</i> case had been decided on that
    basis. It appears that the intent of the legislature was to accept that the <i>Magee</i> and <i>Cohen</i> cases had caused significant problems in the law of
    contribution and indemnity and, as between the importance of enforcing
    limitation periods and the unfairness of precluding claims for contribution
    through no fault of an affected defendant, the legislature preferred to correct
    the latter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary to resolve the question because, as
    a matter of statutory interpretation, it is clear that even without the
    specific language contained in the repealed s. 8 (italicized in para. 15,
    supra)<span class=GramE>,</span> s. 18 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> was intended to and does have the same
    effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 18 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>s. <span class=GramE>18  For</span> the purposes of subsection 5(2)
    and section 15, in the case of a claim by one alleged wrongdoer against another
    for contribution and indemnity, the day on which the first alleged wrongdoer
    was served with the claim in respect of which contribution and indemnity is
    sought shall be deemed to be the day the act or omission on which that alleged
    wrongdoer’s claim is based took place. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5(2) sets the date when a claim is presumed to
    be discovered, and s. 15 provides the ultimate limitation period under the Act.
    Section 4 provides the basic two-year limitation period for all claims unless
    otherwise provided in the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading the relevant sections together, a claim for
    contribution and indemnity, whether in tort or otherwise, now has a two-year
    limitation period that is presumed to run from the date when the person who
    seeks contribution and indemnity is served with the plaintiff’s claim that
    gives rise to its claim over. This is the only limitation period in the Act
    that applies to claims for contribution and indemnity.<a name="_GoBack"></a> The previous limitation period provision that applied where the plaintiff’s
    limitation period against other concurrent tortfeasors had expired, s. 8 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>, is repealed by the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the new Act itself, or in the
    working papers and recommendations that accompanied the drafting of the new
    Act, to suggest that there was any intention to change the effect of s. 8 of
    the <i>Negligence Act</i>, other than as
    specifically done with a new limitation period of two years and a new
    commencement date based on the overriding conceptual basis of the new Act: the
    discoverability of a claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the court were to conclude that, despite the clear
    wording of s. 18, there is a further limitation period that applies to claims
    for contribution and indemnity against a concurrent tortfeasor in negligence,
    and that such claims must also be brought before the expiry of the limitation period
    applicable to the plaintiff’s claim against that tortfeasor, the effect of a universal
    limitation period for contribution and indemnity claims in s. 18 would be
    abrogated and the clarity and efficacy of the section undermined.  In its recent decision in <i>Yugraneft Corp. v. Rexx Management Corp</i>., [2010] 1 S.C.R. 649, the Supreme
    Court explained the streamlining purpose of Alberta’s new limitations regime at
    para.&nbsp;36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The [<i>Limitations</i>]<i> </i>Act was intended to create a comprehensive and simplified
    limitations regime to replace the previous <i>Limitation
    of Actions Act</i>. ...  <span
class=GramE>As the Alberta Court of Appeal noted in <i>Daniels v. Mitchell</i>, 2005 ABCA 271...</span> <span class=GramE>at</span> para. 30:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>[A] <span class=GramE>main</span> purpose of
    the [<i>Limitations Act</i>] was the
    simplification of limitations law, by the imposition of one period (two years)
    for nearly all causes of action. ... [D]ebates in the Legislative Assembly
    repeatedly emphasized that the new legislation would simplify and clarify the
    system while eliminating inconsistencies and special treatment for certain
    defendants.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, the purpose of
    the Act was to streamline the law of limitations by limiting the number of
    exceptions and providing a uniform limitation period for most actions.
    [Internal citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, to the extent that the legislature intended
    to change the law that has been in place since 1948 regarding the requirements
    for bringing a claim for contribution and indemnity, it did so specifically by
    changing the limitation period (from one year to two years) and the
    commencement date from which it runs (from the date of the plaintiff’s judgment
    against a particular tortfeasor to the date when the plaintiff’s claim was
    served on a particular tortfeasor).  The
    new limitation period under s. 18 applies, as did the former one under s. 8, both
    to claims that are tried and to those that are settled (ss.&nbsp;1 and 2 of the <i>Negligence Act)</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 18 also signals that a defendant who wishes to
    claim contribution and indemnity should bring the claim not after judgment in
    the main action, but as part of it. Although in theory a defendant could
    commence a new action for contribution and indemnity within two years of being
    served with a statement of claim, the more likely procedure is to bring a
    cross-claim or third party proceeding in the main action. Even if a new action
    were commenced, one could envision that, for reasons of economy and efficiency,
    the actions would likely be joined and tried together.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the new provision is that the period for
    bringing the claim for contribution and indemnity now coincides much more
    closely with the basic limitation for bringing all actions, and procedurally,
    it is contemplated that all claims arising out of the incident that caused the
    injury will be tried and disposed of together. Therefore, to the extent that a
    claim for contribution and indemnity may be brought beyond the limitation period
    that applied to the plaintiff’s potential claim against a particular tortfeasor,
    the extension is minimized by the operation of s. 18 and any negative
    consequences to the tortfeasor by being brought into an action after he or she
    could have been sued by the plaintiff are minimized as well.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the conclusion reached by the motion judge
    that neither the <i>HSBC</i> nor the <i>Placzek</i> cases decided the issue that has
    arisen squarely for determination in this case. I also agree with the motion
    judge that there is nothing in the new Act that suggests that the legislature
    intended to replace s. 8 of the <i>Negligence
    Act </i>with a new regime that did not protect claims for contribution and
    indemnity in the same way that s. 8 did. In the result, the motion judge was
    correct to dismiss the appellant’s motion for summary judgment that sought
    dismissal before trial of the claim for contribution and indemnity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent
    fixed at $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and all applicable taxes.</p>

    Amendment Act</i>, 4th Sess., 22nd Leg., Ontario, 1948, cl. 3, reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>An example of the situation sought to be taken care of by this
    amendment would be as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Under section 480 of <i>The
    Municipal Act</i> an action against a municipality for the non-repair of a
    highway must be brought within three months after the time when the damages
    were sustained.  If the driver of a car
    brings action within the three-month period for damages sustained on a highway
    against the driver of a second car but does not serve the writ until after the
    expiration of the three-month period, the driver of the second car would be
    precluded from proceeding against the municipal corporation because of the
    lapse of the three-month period.  Under
    the amendment, the driver of the second car would not be so precluded provided
    that he had anticipated the bringing of the action and had served the
    municipality with the notice in writing of his intention to make a claim as
    required by statute.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The same principle applies where the driver of the second car settles
    with the driver of the first car and then seeks contribution or indemnity from
    the municipal corporation.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>The proceedings against the municipality must be commenced within a
    year of the judgment or settlement as the case may be.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The new section is,
    of course, not limited to motor vehicle accidents or municipal corporations but
    the example serves to illustrate the nature and principle of the amendment.</span></p>
