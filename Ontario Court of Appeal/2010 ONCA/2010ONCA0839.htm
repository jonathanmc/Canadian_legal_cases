style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Verna Hall, appeals from the
    trial judge’s decision dismissing her claim against her former solicitor, the
    respondent, Norman Watson, for breach of his duty to her and refusing to order
    that the transfer of her house to the respondent, St. Joseph’s Villa
    Foundation, be set aside.  The case
    involves a transaction whereby Ms. Hall transferred her home to the Foundation
    and retained a life estate in it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The seven day trial focused almost exclusively
    on Ms. Hall’s claim of <i>non <span
class=GramE>est</span> factum</i>.  She
    testified that the deed transferring title to the Foundation, a document drawn
    by Mr. Watson and executed in his presence, was not correctly explained to
    her.  Specifically, Mr. Watson did not
    advise her of the nature of the transfer and therefore she did not understand
    that she was transferring title to the Foundation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The key people involved in the transaction
    testified – Ms. Hall, Mr.  Watson, Mr.
    Hunter who was Ms. Hall’s accountant and Ms. Maureen Ellis, the Foundation’s
    representative.  Given the fact that Ms.
    Hall’s evidence conflicted with the accounts of these other witnesses
    concerning the circumstances surrounding the <span class=GramE>transfer,</span> the trial judge was required to make findings of fact based on his assessment
    of their credibility.  In this respect,
    he found Mr. Hunter, Mr. Watson and Ms. Ellis to be highly credible.  However, he had difficulty accepting Ms.
    Hall’s memory and her firm adherence to a version of the facts that went
    against the weight of all of the other evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on the evidence that he did accept, the
    trial judge found that Ms. Hall fully understood the nature of her gift to the
    Foundation and its legal consequences.  He therefore rejected Ms. Hall’s plea of <i>non <span class=GramE>est</span> factum</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a peripheral issue at trial, Ms. Hall also
    advanced a claim for damages on the basis that Mr. Watson breached his
    fiduciary duty to her.  The underpinning
    of this claim is that according to Ms. Hall, unbeknownst to her, the Foundation
    paid Mr. Watson’s legal fees associated with the transaction.  She argued before the trial judge that this
    put Mr. Watson in a position of a conflict of interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before this court, counsel for Ms. Hall argues a
    completely different case.  The thrust of
    his argument is that Mr. Watson was negligent in carrying out his duties to Ms.
    Hall in relation to the transaction by not ensuring that it dealt with issues
    such as who was to be responsible for municipal taxes and maintenance during
    the period when she lived in the house further to her life interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Hall complains that she now finds herself
    responsible for expenses she had no intention of assuming and associated with a
    house she no longer owns.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, we would not give effect to the appeal in
    relation to the issues raised at trial and in Ms. Hall’s factum.  In rejecting Ms. Hall’s claim of <i>non <span class=GramE>est</span> factum</i>,
    the trial judge made findings of fact supported by the evidence and applied
    them to the correct test associated with such a claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The argument that Mr. Watson was in a conflict
    of interest is fully answered by Mr. Hunter’s evidence that was accepted by the
    trial judge to the effect that, at Ms. Hall’s request, her legal fees in
    connection with the transaction were paid by the Foundation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the issue about the on-going tax and
    maintenance costs associated with the house is not properly before this
    court.  It was not pleaded.  It was not an issue that was developed at
    trial through evidence called or in argument.  In fact, when the matter came up in the course of the trial, counsel for
    Ms. Hall specifically advised the court that his client was not advancing a
    claim in negligence against Mr. Watson for his failure to ensure that these
    items were dealt with in the transfer documentation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Hall also challenges the costs awarded to
    Mr. Watson on a substantial indemnity scale in the amount of $82,318.33.  With respect to costs, the primary error Ms.
    Hall alleges is that the trial judge awarded substantial indemnity costs in
    favour of Mr. Watson based on improper considerations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, there is no reason to interfere
    with the costs award.  As counsel for Ms.
    Hall acknowledges, a trial judge’s costs award attracts great deference.  Given the allegations Ms. Hall made against
    Mr. Watson, it was open to the trial judge to award costs on a substantial
    indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal and the appeal as to costs are both,
    therefore, dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    costs of this appeal shall be fixed in the amount of $19,000 inclusive of
    disbursements and applicable taxes, payable by Ms. Hall to each of Mr. Watson
    and the Foundation.</span></p>
