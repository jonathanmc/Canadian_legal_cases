  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary issue on this appeal queries the role of
    the Ontario Review Board (Board) when reviewing a hospitals decision to significantly
    change the restrictions on the liberty of a patient who has been found not
    criminally responsible (NCR). The secondary issue relates to the Boards annual
    review of the appellants disposition, which was held at the same time as the
    restrictions review.  The appeal
    challenges the Boards finding that the appellant, M.L.C., posed a significant
    threat, as well as its disposition providing for the appellants continued
    detention at the hospital, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the combined restrictions and annual
    review, the NCR appellant was subject to an earlier disposition order in which
    the Board had delegated to CAMH the decision whether to permit the appellant to
    leave the hospital to live in approved accommodation in the community.  CAMH had granted the appellant that
    permission.  Subsequently, when the
    appellant exhibited signs of deterioration in his mental health, CAMH decided
    to increase the restrictions on his liberty and required him to return to live
    in the hospital.  Although the hospital initially
    anticipated that the appellants readmission would be only for a few days, that
    position changed when the appellant tested positive for the use of illicit
    drugs.  The hospital decided to detain
    him for a longer period, particularly given the link between the use of drugs
    and the appellants index offence.  Because the restriction on the appellants liberty was extended beyond
    seven days, the <i>Criminal Code</i> required the hospital to give notice to the Board so that it could review the
    hospitals decision (restrictions review).  At that review, the Board concluded that the
    appellants readmission to the hospital and his ongoing detention to the date
    of the hearing satisfied the relevant test.  At the same time, the Board conducted its
    annual review of the appellants disposition.  In that review, it concluded that the
    appellant presented a significant threat to the public and that no alteration
    in the terms of his disposition was warranted.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss
    the appellants appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, who is 32 years old, was found not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder in 2004 in relation to
    charges of assault with a weapon and sexual assault involving family members.  His mental disorder appeared to have a link to
    his use of illicit drugs.  When the
    appellant was detained in hospital, his treatment included the use of an antipsychotic
    medication.  In 2005, the appellant discontinued
    his medication and he became disorganized, somewhat withdrawn and agitated.  While in this state, he assaulted co-patients.
     His liberty at the hospital was
    restricted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By 2006, the appellants condition improved on a new antipsychotic
    medication.  While he continued on a
    detention order, CAMH released him to 24-hour supervised community
    accommodation.  In 2007, he was again
    readmitted to hospital when he tested positive for cannabis.  After his condition improved, the appellant was
    released to supervised accommodation, but was required to report regularly to
    the hospital. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 2008, the appellant was permitted to move
    into his own approved apartment.  He
    continued to take medication, which he received by way of injection from CAMHs
    clinic. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2009, the appellant declined his medication,
    although the long-lasting nature of the medication meant that it would remain
    in his system until about mid-May 2009.  The
    appellant explained that he declined medication because he had concerns arising
    from the death of a friend at the hospital that may have been related to the
    friends medication.  The appellant also
    had concerns about his own recently high blood sugar, weight gain, sedation and
    muscle stiffness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant agreed to attend clinic five days
    per week for the purpose of closely monitoring his mental status, the hospital
    allowed him to continue to live in the community, even though he was no longer
    taking his medication.  Over the next few
    weeks, the appellant reported an improvement in his mood and communication.  He was seemingly stable.  The hospital reduced his reporting requirement
    to three times weekly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 2009, the Board held its annual review.  It observed that the appellant had not only
    been symptom free and had not acted out in any manner, but also that he
    appeared to be on a positive trajectory since stopping his medications.  The Board continued the appellants detention,
    but again delegated to CAMH the discretion to allow the appellant to
    participate in a broad range of activities in life outside the hospital.  Those activities ranged from living in the
    hospital with permission for accompanied or unaccompanied absences for a number
    of purposes, to living in the community in supervised or approved accommodation.  In light of his apparent stability, the
    appellant at that time was allowed to continue living in his approved
    accommodation, with the caveat that careful monitoring should be
    continued.  The Board ordered a further
    review in six months, rather than the usual 12 months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Initially, the appellant continued to do well.  However, in October 2009, while attending the
    Relapse Prevention Group, the appellant asked sexually inappropriate questions.
     The same month, he exhibited difficulty
    adjusting to a particular caseworker.  He
    became angry when asked for a urine sample.  This new and uncharacteristic behaviour raised
    concerns.  The hospital increased the appellants
    reporting requirement to five days per week. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant cooperated with reporting, he
    was observed to be behaving oddly and perspiring heavily, possible indications of
    illicit drug use.  He resisted the
    scheduling of a home visit to his accommodation.  In November, he requested the removal of the
    fillings from his teeth.  He failed to
    attend clinic. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 11, 2009, the appellant reported several
    hours late.  He was readmitted to CAMH
    for observation.  The hospital hoped to
    stabilize his condition and return him to the community after about a week.  However, the day after admission, the
    appellants urine tested positive for both cocaine and cannabis.  Three further samples taken in early to mid-December
    2009 also showed the presence of cocaine and/or cannabis.  The appellant admitted to the use of illicit substances,
    including on the hospital grounds.  The appellants
    conduct further deteriorated.  He was atypically
    rude to staff and was observed responding to internal stimuli.  At the time, the team at CAMH concluded that
    the appellant was likely suffering from a substance-induced decompensation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellants December 18 urine sample
    tested negative for illicit drugs, and continued to test negative up to the
    time of the review on January 6, 2010, his condition did not improve.  On December 30, 2009, he made a claim in a
    concerning manner that a prescribed cream caused him to have an erection and
    also made inappropriate sexual remarks to a nurse practitioner.  A short time later, he offered condoms to
    female staff.  The next evening, the
    appellant became agitated, rude and threatening in relation to an
    inappropriately-timed demand for a second slice of pizza.  The hospital concluded this kind of uncharacteristic
    conduct demonstrated that the appellant was suffering from disinhibition,
    disorganization and psychotic thought processes.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BOARD HEARING </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board combined the restrictions review it held
    pursuant to s. 672.81(2.1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> with its annual review of the appellants disposition held under s.
    672.81(1).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. Eayrs,
    testified.  The record and her testimony
    demonstrated there was some diagnostic uncertainty about the reasons for the
    appellants ongoing atypical behaviours.  The preferred diagnosis after his readmission
    had been psychosis brought on by the use of cocaine and cannabis.  However, based on the events of the preceding
    week, Dr. Eayrs could not rule out a primary psychotic disorder, such as
    schizoaffective disorder.  If that
    diagnosis was correct, the appellants mental health, she opined, would likely
    be improved only with the use of medication.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of that evidence, as well as the evidence
    that the appellants post-hospitalization conduct was nothing like his
    ordinary conduct, which is routinely quiet and laconic, the Board found the
    restriction to return him to the hospital was warranted and it ordered the
    appellants ongoing detention, subject to conditions that included the
    potential for his return to approved accommodation in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Boards reasons gave prominence to the appellants refusal
    to take antipsychotic medication.  The
    Board apparently attributed the appellants deterioration largely to that
    refusal.  The Board further found that the
    appellants refusal to take medication was deliberate, which it considered to
    be an element in the assessment of whether the appellant presents a significant
    threat.  The Boards reasons referred to
    the hospital teams provisional diagnosis of drug-induced psychosis, but
    concluded that the evidence pointed more towards a psychoaffective disorder for
    which the appellant would be required to take medication.  Apparently concerned with the appellants deliberate
    refusal, the Board commented that the appellants grandmother could be a
    candidate as his substitute decision-maker.  The Board did not consider the appellants significant
    concerns about the potentially deleterious effects of medication beyond
    acknowledging the appellants reference to his weight gain and high
    blood-fasting sugars.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the Board was unanimous that the
    decision made to bring the accused back into the Hospital [thereby placing
    significant restrictions on his liberty] was sound and in the very best interests
    of the accused and the public.  It also
    concluded that, at the time of the review, the appellant was a significant
    threat to the public and that no alteration in the terms of his disposition
    was warranted and that the extension of his inpatient status made and makes
    good sense. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Board considered the argument of the
    appellants counsel that it was unreasonable for the Board to conclude that the
    appellant presented a significant threat.  This argument was based on Dr. Eayrs
    testimony that she would not have relied on the provisions of the <i>Mental Health Act</i> <i>(MHA) </i>to return the appellant to CAMH.  Counsel reasoned that if the doctor did not
    consider that the appellant posed a likelihood of serious bodily harm to
    another within the meaning of s. 20 of the <i>MHA</i>,
    the doctor could not be of the opinion that the appellant met the test of significant
    threat under s. 672.54 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, or at least that he was not a candidate for a conditional discharge.  The Board rejected this argument for three
    reasons.  First, it did not share counsels
    interpretation of the doctors evidence; second, it concluded that the tests
    under the two statutes were not identical; and third, the Board concluded that
    the appellant posed a current significant threat, a conclusion that overrode
    any preliminary view that might have been expressed by the doctor relevant to
    the time when the appellant was apprehended.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In arriving at its initial disposition for a patient
    found not criminally responsible under s. 672.54 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the Board is required to consider the protection of
    the public as well as the mental condition, potential for reintegration and the
    other needs of the patient to arrive at a disposition that is least onerous and
    least restrictive for the patient.  If
    the patient does not pose a significant threat to the public, the Board will
    grant an absolute discharge.  Otherwise,
    the Board will detain or conditionally discharge the patient. </p>

lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A Boards disposition usually contains appropriate
    conditions that delegate to the hospital a broad scope to increase or restore
    liberties to reintegrate a patient gradually into the community, or to restrict
    liberties when a patient needs to be closely monitored in a hospital setting.  This is why a disposition such as the
    appellants attaches conditions ranging from living in the hospital to living
    in approved accommodation.  A Board is
    required to review a patients disposition not later than every 12 months.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The framework and the different interests
    involved in the determination of a patients disposition were recently
    explained by Abella J. in <i>R. v. Conway</i>,
    [2010] 1 S.C.R. 765, at paras. 88-93:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is well established that the review board regime
    is intended to reconcile the twin goals of protecting the public from
    dangerous offenders, and treating NCR patients fairly and appropriately [citations
    omitted].  <i>While public safety is the paramount concern, an NCR patients liberty
    interest has been held to be the Boards major preoccupation within the fence
    posts staked by public safety </i>(<i>Pinet
    v. St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital</i>, 2004 S.C.C. 21, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 528, at
    para. 19).  The Board fulfills its primary
    purpose therefore by protecting the public while minimizing incursions on
    patients liberty and treating patients fairly (<i>Mazzei</i>, at para. 32; <i>Winko</i>,
    at paras. 64-71; <i>Penetanguishene</i>, at
    para. 51). [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Accordingly,
    at a disposition hearing regarding an NCR patient, the Ontario Review Board is
    authorized to make one of three dispositions: an absolute discharge, a
    conditional discharge or a detention order.  When making its disposition, the Board must
    consider the four statutory criteria:  the
    need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the patients mental
    condition, the reintegration of the patient into society and the patients
    other needs.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Board
    has a necessarily broad discretion to consider a large range of evidence in
    order to fulfill this mandate (<i>Winko</i>, at para. 61).  The Boards assessment of the evidence must take
    place in an environment respectful of the NCR accuseds constitutional rights,
    free from the negative stereotypes that have too often in the past prejudiced
    the mentally ill who come into contact with the justice system (<i>Winko</i>,
    at para. 61).  Upon considering the
    evidence, if the Board is not of the opinion that the patient is a significant
    threat to public safety, it must direct that the patient be discharged
    absolutely (s. 672.54(<i>a</i>); <i>Winko</i>, at para. 62).  On the other hand, if the Board finds that the
    patient is, as in Mr. Conways case, a significant threat to public safety, an
    absolute discharge is not statutorily available as a disposition (s. 672.54; <i>Winko</i>,
    at para. 62).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A patient
    is not a significant threat to public safety unless he or she is a real risk
    of physical or psychological harm to members of the public that is serious in
    the sense of going beyond the merely trivial or annoying (<i>Winko</i>, at
    para. 62).  The conduct giving rise to
    the harm must be criminal in nature (<i>Winko</i>, at paras. 57 and 62).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Once a
    patient is absolutely discharged, he or she is no longer subject to the
    criminal justice system or to the Boards jurisdiction (<i>Mazzei</i>, at para.
    34).  However, pending an absolute
    discharge, NCR patients are subject to a detention or conditional discharge
    order.  The Board is entitled to include
    appropriate conditions in its orders (s. 672.54(b) and (c)). <i>The appropriateness of conditions is tied,
    at least in part, to the framework for making the least onerous and least
    restrictive disposition </i>consistent with public safety, the patients mental
    condition and other needs, and the patients reintegration into the community
    (s. 672.54(<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>); <i>Penetanguishene</i>, at paras. 51 and 56).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Board
    is not entitled to include any conditions that prescribe or impose treatment on
    an NCR patient (s. 672.55; <i>Mazzei</i>) and any conditions must withstand <i>Charter</i> scrutiny (<i>Slaight</i>).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the conditions imposed by the Board were
    not to pertain to the particulars of the appellants treatment or medication,
    but rather to the envelope outlining the liberties he was permitted during the
    duration of the Boards disposition.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Restrictions Reviews</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In <i><span
style='color:black'>Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre v. Ontario (Attorney
    General)</span></i><span style='color:black'>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 498 (<i>Tulikorpi</i>),</span> Binnie</span> J. outlined
    the application of the least onerous and least restrictive standard that balances
    public safety and patient liberty in determining the patients disposition, as
    well as the parameters of the accompanying envelope of appropriate conditions.  Binnie J. explained at paras. 68-70 how the
    disposition and the conditions provide flexibility to the hospital to restrict
    a patients liberty:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Thus,
    within the outer envelope established by the Review Board order, a hospital
    administrator may move to restrict the detainees liberty if circumstances
    warrant, although if the restriction is significant and lasts longer than seven
    days, the Review Board must be notified and a hearing held:  see Wording of Custodial Disposition Orders,
    s. 4 in <i>Manual of Operating Guidelines for Provincial Psychiatric Hospitals</i> (June 1995).  If problems arise, such as <span
class=GramE>a deterioration</span> in the mental condition of a hospital
    detainee permitted residence in the community, the detainee can be returned to
    the hospital without the need of any prior order of a court or the Review
    Board.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    delegated authority, of course, must be exercised having due regard to the
    detainees liberty interest in light of the twin goals of public safety and
    treatment, but it permits a degree of day-to-day fine tuning that, if properly
    exercised, will prevent the least onerous and least restrictive requirement
    from compromising achievement of treatment objectives.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    evidence therefore establishes that, while imposition of the least onerous and
    least restrictive requirement on the conditions of detention viewed in their
    entirety may create difficulty in some situations, the difficulty is manageable
    and in fact is being managed by
    Ontario Review Board at the present time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the Board has the jurisdiction to review a
    patients disposition at a particular hearing<span class=GramE>,</span> it is
    not in a position to oversee the patient on a day-to-day basis and to refine
    the restrictions on his or her liberty.  This
    is why the statutory framework gives the hospital the ability and flexibility
    to monitor patients who suffer from mental disorder.  The responsibility for adjusting the
    restrictions for such a patient comes from s. 672.56(1), which allows the Board
    to delegate to the hospital certain decisions about the patients liberty.  Any restrictions the hospital places on the
    patient must fall within the envelope of the conditions enumerated by the Board
    in its disposition.  As a safeguard, any
    decision by a hospital that significantly restricts a patients liberty for
    more than seven days must be considered by the Board in a restrictions review.   </p>

    that is the subject matter of the review, and; second, the applicable standard

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Supported by the Crown, <i>amicus</i> argues that the Board should conduct the review based on the
    patients circumstances at the time the restrictions decision was made, as well
    as during the ensuing period that the restrictions remained in place up to the
    time of the restrictions review.  If this
    argument is accepted, the restrictions review in this case would look at the
    hospitals decision from the date of the appellants readmission on November
    11, 2009 until the restrictions review on January 6, 2010.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the hospital argues that the Board may
    only consider whether the decision met the applicable standard at the time it
    was made, and that the Board has no jurisdiction to consider the effects of the
    decision thereafter.   If the hospitals
    position is right, the limited question for the restrictions review is whether
    the hospitals decision met the standard on November 11, 2009.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Amicus</i> also argues that the applicable standard of the Boards review is whether the
    restrictions imposed by the hospital were the least onerous and least
    restrictive in the circumstances, while the hospital argues for a standard
    based on whether the hospitals decision demonstrated prudent risk management
    and, in its factum, the Crown argues for a standard of whether the decision was
    appropriate in the circumstances.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The argument about time parameters is based on
    the 2006 change to the wording of the relevant C<i>riminal Code</i> provision.  In
    the former s. 672.81(2), Parliament provided for the Board to review the hospitals
    disposition, while the new s. 672.81(2.1) provides for the Board to review the
    hospitals restrictions decision.<a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is evident from Parliaments replacement of any
    disposition with a decision that it intended that the review focus on the
    decision to impose the particular restriction on the patients liberty.  At the same time, s. 672.83(1) requires the
    Board to review and make any changes to the patients disposition that are
    appropriate in the circumstances, which suggests a broader look at the
    overall envelope.  In any event, when read
    in the framework of Part XX.1, nothing in the amendment freezes the Boards analysis
    to the point in time when the decision was made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would make no sense for the Board to confine its
    consideration to the moment in time of the imposition of the restriction
    without considering the ongoing nature and the effect of the decision on the
    patients liberty to the date of the review.  The purpose of the restrictions review is to provide a mechanism to monitor
    significant changes in the patients liberty and to ensure that liberty is
    infringed only to the extent necessary to protect public safety in the
    timeframe between the patients annual dispositions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A point-in-time restriction could create a gap in the
    Boards overview of the patients disposition and hamper the Boards
    effectiveness in achieving the overall objectives of the legislation.  Moreover, if the hospital imposed
    restrictions that met the standard at the time of the imposition, but the
    restrictions did not continue to do so at the time of the review, the Board
    should be in a position to make a decision based on the patients condition at that
    time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In most cases, there should not be a prolonged
    timeframe between the decision and the review.  Section 672.81(2.1) obliges the Board to conduct the restrictions review
    as soon as practicable after receiving the notice.  And s. 672.83(1) provides the Board the right
    to review the patients disposition in the context of a restrictions
    review.  Moreover, if concerns arise
    about the patients disposition during the restrictions review, s. 672.82(1)
    explicitly provides that the Board may call for another hearing to review its
    own disposition.  Where a Board calls for
    such a discretionary review, it is required by s. 672.82(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>1.1)
    to provide notice to the prosecutor, the patient and any other party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While in this case it apparently proved convenient for
    all parties to combine the restrictions review with the appellants annual
    review, in many instances it may not be in the interests of the patient or the
    hospital to delay the restrictions review, or to trigger an annual review that
    may result in unnecessarily long-term consequences for the patients disposition.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the Board was entitled, indeed
    mandated, to consider the indefinite nature of the hospitals decision and the ongoing
    circumstances of the appellant from the time of the decision up to and
    including the time of the review.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        (b)       The test to be applied at a restrictions
    review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant proposes that the reviewing Board ask
    whether the hospitals decision to significantly restrict the patients liberty
    met the least onerous and least  restrictive
    test that is set out in s. 672.54 for the Boards disposition, which in turn is
    based on the four enumerated factors referencing public safety and patient
    liberty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hospital takes the position that the Boards test
    should be limited to whether the hospitals decision reflected prudent risk
    management, while the Crown argues in its factum for a standard that asks
    whether the decision was appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The wording prudent risk management proposed by the
    hospital does not appear in the legislative scheme.  Indeed, such a standard could place undue
    emphasis on the goal of public safety, without properly balancing the other objective
    of treating the NCR patient fairly and taking into consideration the patients
    liberty interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appropriate standard is also too
    broad.  As Binnie J. observed at para. 48
    of <i>Tulikorpi</i>, [t]he word appropriate
    (indique) generally confers a very broad latitude and discretion.  Although not employed in the provision at
    issue, the word appropriate is employed elsewhere in the <i>Criminal Code </i> the conditions imposed must be appropriate and s.
    672.83(1) also references appropriate.  However, Binnie J. explained at para. 51 of <i>Tulikorpi </i>the meaning of appropriate in the context of arriving
    at a least onerous and least restrictive disposition:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> but appropriate having regard to the four enumerated
    factors (public safety, mental condition of the accused, other needs of the
    accused, and the reintegration of the accused into society) to fashion a
    disposition that is the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused.  This is clear from <i>Winko</i>, <i>supra</i>, where, in
    dealing with the <i>Charter</i> challenge
    under s. 7, McLachlin J. observed, at para. 71, that the scheme ensures that
    the NCR accuseds liberty will be trammelled no more than is necessary to
    protect public safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach was recently reiterated in <i>Conway, supra, </i>where Abella J. observed at
    para. 92 that the appropriateness of conditions is tied, at least in part, to
    the framework for making the least onerous and least restrictive disposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hospital argues that it is not bound, nor is it
    equipped, to assess a decision to significantly restrict a patients liberty on
    a least onerous and least restrictive standard.  I do not accept this argument.  As
    a practical matter, the hospital makes precisely that assessment, although likely
    using different language, when it exercises the discretion delegated to it by
    the Board and makes day-to-day decisions about the patients care in light of
    both safety and liberty interests.  In
    addition, the hospital gives its opinion and recommendations about the
    patients disposition in its report before and at the disposition hearing and
    at review hearings.  In my view, the
    hospital is capable of and actually does apply the least onerous and least
    restrictive standard on a regular basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus</i> argues
    that the Board failed to apply that standard at the restrictions review.  I cannot agree.  The Board expressly addressed both components
    of public safety and patient liberty when it concluded that the restriction and
    its continuation make good sense from the perspective of the public and the
    accused.  Undoubtedly, it would have
    been preferable for the Board to explicitly refer to the restrictions as
    meeting the least onerous and least restrictive standard.  However, this was an experienced Board that
    would have been alive to the correct standard.  Moreover, its application is implicit in the Boards reasons.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         The annual review</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Significant threat  the <i>MHA</i> argument</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this argument, <i>amicus</i> takes the position that, if the appellant did not meet the <i>MHA</i> standard for civil committal, the Board was obliged to conclude
    he did not present a significant threat within the meaning of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions.  If <i>amicus</i> is correct, and the appellant did not pose a significant threat, he would have
    been entitled to an absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of her argument, as expressed in her factum, <i>amicus</i> interprets Dr. Eayrs evidence
    as providing the opinion that the appellant did not pose a significant threat
    to the safety of the public at the time that he was admitted to the hospital
    and, could not have been admitted [by civil certification], absent a detention
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus</i> raises
    the criteria for civil certification under the <i>MHA</i> for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she argues that the appellant could not be found
    to be a significant threat at his January annual review if Dr. Eayrs had
    conceded that he was not certifiable on November 11, 2009.  <i>Amicus</i> argues that if the appellant was not civilly certifiable then, he could not be
    said to pose a significant threat under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provisions and should have been discharged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, <i>amicus</i> argues that a detention order, with the ability to apprehend on a warrant, is
    unnecessary if the appellant could be apprehended under the <i>MHA</i>.  If an apprehension under the <i>MHA</i> is feasible, <i>amicus</i> argues that the appellant should be conditionally discharged
    because that is the least onerous and least restrictive disposition. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the differences between the relevant
    provisions in the <i>MHA</i> and the <i>Criminal Code</i> and their purposes, there
    is a significant problem with the interpretation argued by <i>amicus</i>:  it is not supported
    by the evidentiary findings of the Board.  Those findings are entitled to considerable deference.  The Board did not interpret Dr. Eayrs
    evidence to find that she concluded the appellant did not meet the <i>MHA</i> test.  The transcript makes it clear that Dr. Eayrs
    stated simply that the <i>MHA</i> route was
    not viable at the time the restriction was imposed, given the lack of contact
    with the appellant, any explanation for his conduct, and the absence of any
    evidence or admissions at that point that he was again consuming illicit drugs
    or had otherwise triggered a psychosis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was in these circumstances that the hospital decided
    to proceed with the warrant of committal provisions in the<i> Criminal Code</i>.  That
    decision was amply supported by the evidence that the appellant had suffered a
    significant deterioration in his mental stability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was not a case where the Board erred in failing to
    consider how the appellant could be discharged conditionally.  Dr. Eayrs pointed to circumstances that
    demonstrated why it would be very difficult to  manage M.L.C.under the <i>Mental Health Act</i> in the event of a
    conditional discharge.  There was simply
    not an air of reality to a conditional discharge at the time of the review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, in <i>Tulikorpi</i> at para. 68, Binnie J. explained the importance of conditions that allow a
    detained patient to be returned to hospital without the need of any prior
    order of the court or the Review Board.  For a discussion of the use of the warrant provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the need to consider
    options available under the <i>MHA</i> on a
    conditional discharge, see <i>R. v.
    Breitweiser</i><a name="OLE_LINK3">, 2009 ONCA 784</a>, as well as <i>R. v. Lamanna</i>, [2009] <span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>252 O.A.C. 28</span>.  See also <i>R.
    v. Runnalls</i>, [2009] <span style='line-height:
200%;color:black'>251 O.A.C. 284 and <i>R.
    v. Simpson</i>, 2010 ONCA 302.</span>  I
    conclude that the <i>MHA </i>argument advanced
    by <i>amicus</i> is not raised by the facts
    of this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)       Significant
    threat finding</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the <i>MHA</i> argument, there are several other bases on which <i>amicus</i> takes issue with the Boards interpretation of the evidence
    about the appellants condition for the purposes of his annual review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellants concerns about certain
    aspects of the Boards reasons are understandable, particularly because those
    reasons will inform his next annua<span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>l review.  Ho</span>wever, <span style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>reading the reasons as</span> a whole, I do not conclude that the
    decision arrived at by the Board was unreasonable, not supported by the
    evidence or that it disclosed an error of law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the appellants concerns is that the reasons
    cast a negative light on his refusal to take medication and that they do so without
    referring to his concern about the death of a friend in the institution.  The appellant understood that the friend died
    from metabolic complications caused by the medication.  It is understandable that this would be
    particularly concerning for the appellant in light of his recent problems with
    his own high blood sugar.  While not
    affecting the appellants worrisome conduct or the criterion of significant
    risk, the appellants concerns certainly provide an explanation for his
    medication-related fears.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus</i> also
    queries the terminology employed by the Board in referring to the appellants deliberate
    refusal of medication as something that increased the risk.  While the appellant admittedly had the
    capacity at law to refuse medication, the Boards terminology may be read to
    suggest that the Board made its assessment based on what it perceived to be the
    fault of the patient.  Fault for the
    appellants illness was not a relevant consideration.  Fault should not be a factor when a patient
    is suffering from an active mental imbalance, even though the imbalance may not
    be sufficient at law to render the person incompetent regarding the capacity to
    consent to treatment.  In any event, I
    observe that, at the time of the review, the hospital had little opportunity to
    provide the appellant with information and education about the proposed new metabolically-neutral
    medication and to reassure him, if possible, about its consequences.  In those circumstances, even if fault were an
    appropriate consideration, it did not arise in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Boards reasons appear to place a
    great deal of weight on the need to treat the appellant with medication.  The Boards reference to the potential need for
    medication was understandable given the appellants condition leading up to the
    reviews, including the potential that his behaviour was not induced by illicit
    drugs, but rather reflected an underlying mental disorder.  However, in focussing on medication, the
    Boards reasons fail to balance this with the considerable evidence about the appellants
    success in living in the community for some months without any medication,
    particularly, as Dr. Eayrs testified, if his symptoms clear without
    antipsychotic treatment, and if he succeeds in abstaining from those
    substances, then I think he could be discharged back to the community.  While there was unquestionably a need to
    carefully monitor the appellant, it was not absolutely certain that he would be
    required to take medication in order to regain his mental health. Rather, the
    evidence supported diagnostic uncertainty at the time of the review and,
    accordingly, the need for ongoing monitoring.  The reasons could have better reflected this uncertainty.  Nonetheless, this deficiency did not detract
    from the validity of the conclusions reached by the Board and the abundance of
    evidence that supported those conclusions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant argues that the Board erred in
    failing to consider the viability of a conditional (or absolute) discharge.  As I have said, there was ample evidence of
    the appellants lack of stability and the Board was alive to that evidence.  It was reasonable for the Board to conclude
    on the evidence that the appellants ongoing detention (with significant
    flexibility to return him to approved accommodation if it becomes warranted)
    was the least onerous and least restrictive disposition consistent with public
    safety.  Accordingly, I would not
    interfere with the Boards decision.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appellants
    appeal regarding the combined restrictions and annual review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am grateful to <i>amicus</i> and to all counsel for their argument of this appeal.</p>
