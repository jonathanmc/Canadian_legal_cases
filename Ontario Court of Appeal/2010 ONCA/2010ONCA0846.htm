  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions by a jury for
    sexual interference and sexual assault in relation to each of his two nieces.
    He also appeals his sentence of six years imprisonment less credit for one and
    a half years for pre-trial detention. As well, he appeals his subsequent
    conviction by judge alone for sexually assaulting and interfering with his
    nephew, for which he received a further three years imprisonment. He has served
    two years and four months of his global sentence of nine years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have concluded that both conviction appeals must be
    allowed and new trials ordered. In the circumstances, we propose to give our
    decision now with brief reasons. Fuller reasons will follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his appeal from conviction for the offences
    involving his nieces, the appellant raises three grounds that have merit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant says that there was sufficient
    evidence  both direct and circumstantial  of the opportunity for innocent
    collusion between the two nieces (who were the only Crown witnesses) to require
    that the jury be cautioned about this in assessing the credibility of each of
    them. Recognizing that the trial judge was not asked to give such a caution, we
    nonetheless agree with the appellants submission. As the trial judge
    recognized, aspects of their evidence, particularly the identical but unusual
    language in which their complaints were made, give rise to this concern.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant argues that a caution was
    warranted concerning the specific frailties of the evidence of each complainant
    beyond the generic caution appropriate for youthful witnesses generally. Again
    we agree. As the trial judge made clear in his fact finding at the time of
    sentencing, there were a number of troubling aspects to the evidence of the
    complainants. In our view, these were sufficient to warrant such a caution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the appellant
    submits that the Crowns address was so inflammatory that taken together with
    the other two errors, it deprived the appellant of a fair trial. We agree with
    this submission. We recognize that the appellant did not ask for a mistrial
    because of the Crowns closing and likely decided not to do so for tactical
    reasons. We also recognize that in his charge to the jury, the trial judge went
    a long way to try to undo the damage caused by the Crowns closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the emotional rhetoric in the Crowns closing
    was very hard to completely balance in an instruction. Moreover, there was one
    particularly troubling aspect of the Crowns closing that the trial judge did
    not deal with in his charge: the Crowns inflammatory comment to the jury
    suggesting the complainants had no motive for fabricating their allegations. In
    our view, to correct this comment a caution such as that outlined in <i>R. v. L.(L.)</i>, 2009 244 C.C.C. (3d) 149
    (Ont. C.A.) was necessary. The trial judge did not have the benefit of this
    courts reasons in that case. Suffice it to say that the Crowns closing in
    this case was at least as inflammatory and in many of the same ways as that in<i> L.(L.)</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking these errors together we conclude that the
    appellant did not receive the fair trial to which he was entitled. We would set
    aside the convictions and order a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the convictions for the offences involving his
    nephew, the Crown fairly acknowledges that these convictions cannot stand
    because of a legal error made by the trial judge. The trial judge had allowed
    as similar fact the evidence of the two nieces. That she was entitled to do.
    However, in assessing the strength of that evidence, she held that she was
    bound by the jurys verdict in the prior case. That holding was legally wrong
    because the principles of issue estoppel and <i>res judicata</i> do not apply in criminal law. See <i>R. v. Mahalingan</i>, 2008 237 C.C.C. (3d) 417 SCC paras. 56-59. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These convictions must also be set aside and a new
    trial ordered. </p>
