  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. and Mrs. Ilic separated after a 9-year marriage during which they
    had two children, Tatiana and Aleksander.  Pursuant to a consent order granted
    by Reilly J. on September 26, 2007, the issues of custody, access, child
    support s.7 expenses and the costs associated with those issues, were
    resolved.  In February and March 2009 and February 2010, Tucker J. tried the
    remaining issues relating to (a) arrears of child support and education costs;
    (b) the amount of the equalization payment to be made; (c) a commercial
    property known as 125 Ainslie St. N., Cambridge; and (d) costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude that the trial judge erred in certain respects in relation
    to each of these areas and that the appeal must be allowed and the two orders
    of the judge below dated October 9, 2009 and February 17, 2010 be varied as
    follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Mr. Parker fairly concedes that the trial judge erred in failing
    to give the appellant credit in the amount of a further $6,364.00 with respect
    to child support.  As a result, there are no arrears of child support and
    education expenses owing.  Paragraph 1 of the October 9, 2009 order is varied
    to provide for no arrears of child support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, we would vary the equalization payment of $104,169.67 ordered
    to be paid by the appellant.  The appellant is entitled to a credit of the
    difference between the amount of $3,869 erroneously found to be arrears of
    child support, and now eliminated, and the uncredited amount of $6364 referred
    to above, namely $2495.  In addition, the trial judge failed to take into account
    the fact that $7500 of the payments to the father with respect to the
    appellant’s loan from the father on the Ainslie property were paid after
    separation.  She therefore undervalued the extent of the debt to the father as
    of the date of separation.  One-half of that amount, namely $3750, is to be
    deducted from the equalization payment owing.  Paragraph 1 of the February 17,
    1010 is varied accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant attacked the trial judge’s findings with respect to the
    value of the Café Malibu business, the wife’s jewellery, the Ainslie St.
    property, the appellant’s Xotica business, and other minor assets – all with a
    view to reducing the amount of his equalization payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was in a difficult position as the evidence led on those
    various matter of value was weak.  She did the best she could, and we are
    satisfied overall that it was open to her to make the findings she did with
    respect to them.  We would not interfere further with the equalization amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most troubling aspect of this appeal is the trial judge’s order that
    the Ainslie property be sold and the proceeds held in trust pending a
    determination of who is entitled to what, amongst the appellant, the respondent
    and the appellant’s father.  We can see no basis in law on her findings for
    such an order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s father, Jovan Ilic, is the registered owner of the
    property.  The property had been purchased in 2004 by the appellant’s company
    for $115,000 – $111,179.75 of which was advanced by Mr. Ilic Sr.  The evidence
    of the appellant and his father was that the appellant was to repay the debt at
    the rate of $1500 per month (Mr. Ilic Sr. would carry the taxes) and that, in
    the event of default, the title to 125 Ainslie was to revert to Mr. Ilic Sr. 
    At some point after separation, the appellant ceased making payments on the
    loan.  (He was in jail, having been arrested on drug-related charges.  He
    remained incarcerated at the time of trial.)  In any event, the title to the
    Ainslie property was formally transferred to Mr. Ilic Sr. in January 15, 2007</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Ilic commences a fraudulent conveyance action against Mr. Ilic Sr.
    seeking to set aside the transfer.  We know little about the processing of that
    action, but the record indicates that by agreement of counsel at the conclusion
    of trial, an order was sought consolidating the fraudulent conveyance action
    with the <i>Divorce Act</i> action and Mr. Ilic’s statement of defence was
    apparently filed at that time.  No formal order to this effect was ever made
    and Mr. Ilic Sr. does not seem to have been involved in defending himself on
    those issues at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her second decision, the trial judge observed that the transfer was
    “very suspicious”.  She ordered the property sold.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This order cannot stand.  Mr. Ilic Sr. is not a party to these proceedings
    under appeal.  More significantly, the trial judge made no finding that the
    transfer or conveyance was fraudulent.  In fact, no order was made declaring
    the transfer null and void and setting it aside.  Without such a finding, there
    is no basis in law to transfer title from Mr. Ilic Sr. or to order it sold
    without his consent.  The order for the sale of the Ainslie property is set
    aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the costs ordered at trial, the bill of costs included
    costs incurred before the date of the order of Reilly J. dated September 26,
    2007 providing that “each party shall bear its own costs to date.”  In
    addition, the costs submitted included costs for small claims court
    proceedings.  Finally, the costs award includes costs of the fraudulent
    conveyance action.  Accordingly, we would vary the costs awarded to reflect
    only costs of the <i>Divorce Act</i> proceedings after the order of Reilly J. 
    We fix those costs of trial at $20,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed and the orders of Tucker J. varied as set out
    above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Success was divided.  There will no costs of the appeal.</p>
