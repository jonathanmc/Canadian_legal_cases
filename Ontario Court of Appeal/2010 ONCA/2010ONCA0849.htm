style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This was a trial of an allegation of sexual
    assault where the primary theory of the defence was that the complainant was
    lying.  The Crown called several
    witnesses, including the complainant and two of her friends who were directly
    involved in most of the relevant circumstances.  The defendant did not testify or call any evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge disagreed that the complainant
    was lying and believed her evidence specific to the sexual assault.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in three ways.  First, he argues that the
    trial judge failed to properly analyze the inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    testimony and that of her two friends for purposes of assessing both the
    credibility and reliability of the complainant.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As this court has held on many occasions, a
    trial judge is not required to address every alleged inconsistency.  Rather, he or she is only required to give
    such detail as the evidentiary record and the dynamics of the case
    mandate.  The trial judge in this case
    was aware that drugs and alcohol were consumed, and he noted that while there
    were inconsistencies in the testimony of the complainant and her two friends,
    he found that the inconsistencies were not material.  He committed no error in his analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred in accepting the complainant’s evidence that the sexual assault was
    not consensual.  Again, we disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although defence counsel in cross-examination
    suggested to her that she had agreed to exchange sex for drugs, she
    specifically denied this, and while the appellant is correct that it was open
    to the trial judge to disbelieve her, he did not.  As his reasons illustrate, the complainant’s
    evidence to a large extent was confirmed by her two friends.  The trial judge was also correct in holding
    that there was no evidence otherwise, merely defence counsel’s submissions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, we disagree with the appellant’s third
    argument that the verdict is unreasonable.  Once the analysis and findings of the trial judge have been confirmed,
    as they were in this case, there is ample basis to conclude that a properly
    instructed judge acting judicially could reasonably have rendered this verdict.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
