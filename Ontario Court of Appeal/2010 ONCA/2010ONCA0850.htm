    property). It sold the property to PFB Investments Ltd.  The sale was completed on October 19, 2006
    (the closing).  On closing, PFB directed
    title to <span class=SpellE>Malla</span> Properties Inc. (the Purchaser). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    lawyers to appeal the property’s tax assessment.  The Vendor continued to pursue the assessment
    appeal after closing and was ultimately successful.  In November 2008, the property was reassessed
    with the result that a refund of $251,166.43 (the refund) was owed for the
    period 2003 to 2006.</span></p>

    application in which it asked the court to direct the Purchaser to deliver the majority
    of the refund to it.  The Vendor did not
    seek the entire refund because it accepted that the Purchaser could retain the
    part that related to the period after closing.  </span></p>

    (the Order), the application judge dismissed the application.  In his view, at the time the property was
    sold, the most that the Vendor could be said to have in respect of its assessment
    appeal was a “contingent prospect for receiving a tax refund in an amount yet
    to be determined”.  He stated that the
    Vendor could not have sued on the basis of such an interest and opined that it
    could not be a chose in action.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge rejected
    the Purchaser’s argument that it was entitled to the refund because of
    provisions in various pieces of legislation governing real property.  He noted that such legislation relates to
    land and interests therein and that it is not clear that the “creation of a
    request for a tax refund gives rise to a right against land or the title to the
    land”.  </span></p>

    claim.  Nonetheless, he held that because
    s. 306(2) of the <i>City of Toronto Act,
    2006 </i>authorized payment of the refund to the Purchaser, the Purchaser had a
    juristic reason to retain it.    </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES </span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In order to decide this appeal,
    two issues must be addressed:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US> Did the right to the refund pass to the Purchaser on the sale of
    the   property?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>2.</span><span
lang=EN-US>  Is the Purchaser entitled to
    retain the refund as a result of s. 306(2) of the <i>City of Toronto Act, 2006</i>?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span lang=EN-US>1.         DID THE RIGHT TO THE REFUND PASS TO THE PURCHASER ON THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY?</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I begin with a point of
    clarification.  While I have referred to
    the right in question as “the right to the refund”, that is not completely accurate.  On October 19, 2006, immediately prior to
    closing, the Vendor had the right to pursue the assessment appeal that it had
    launched in respect of the property and to receive any benefit that might flow
    from that appeal (the right).  At the
    time of closing, because the reassessment had not yet been performed, there was
    no right to a refund.  The right was to
    receive the fruits of the process that the Vendor had undertaken.  The value of those fruits might be $0.  Nonetheless, whatever its value, the Vendor
    was entitled to (<i>i.e. </i>owned) the
    right.      </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are two ways in which the
    right could have passed to the Purchaser on closing:  under the terms of the agreement of purchase
    and sale (the Agreement) or as a result of the operation of real property legislation.  As I will explain, neither resulted in the
    right being conveyed to the Purchaser.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before embarking on that
    explanation, it is essential to focus on the legal nature of the right.  As previously mentioned, on October 19, 2006
    immediately prior to closing, the Vendor had the right to the proceeds of the
    assessment appeal.  What kind of property
    right is that?  Is it a right that
    attaches to the land or a personal right that belonged to the Vendor?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Ontario Municipal Board wrestled
    with this question in <i>Mitsubishi
    Electronics Canada Inc. v. Ontario Property Assessment Corp., Region No. 16</i>,
    [2000] O.M.B.D. No. 406.  It concluded
    that the right is a chose in action and not one that runs with the land.  The Board’s reasoning, with which I agree, can
    be summarized as follows.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The assessment of land and the
    taxation of land are distinct processes.  The assessment of a piece of land is the valuation given to it for the
    purposes of determining the quantum of property taxes.  The assessment of the land does not relate to
    its use or enjoyment and does not fall within the provisions of s. 15 of the <i>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34.  The alteration of
    an assessment on an appeal does not give rise to an asset or liability.  Only the separate mechanism of the
    application of a tax rate by the taxing authority results in a debt or refund.
    That mechanism is independent of the assessment process itself.  By virtue of legislation,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> outstanding taxes on a piece of land are a debt to the municipality for which
    the municipality has been granted a special enforcement right.  The burden of outstanding taxes is assigned
    to a new owner through the conveyance and transfer of the land, subject to the
    purchaser’s recourse against the vendor.  However, an assessment appeal is a chose in action that is not assigned
    by operation of law.  Instead, it must be
    expressly assigned if it is to pass from a vendor to a purchaser.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In many ways, the right in
    question is akin to the right of a taxpayer to receive a refund for any
    overpayment in taxes.  If a taxpayer has
    the right to a refund of overpayment, he or she may enforce that right by an
    action against the government:  see <span
class=SpellE><i>Profitt</i></span><i> v. Ad Productions Ltd. (Trustee of)</i> (2002),
    157 O.A.C. 356 (C.A.) at paras. 18-20<span class=GramE>.  Similarly</span>, if an assessment appeal is
    successful, the property owner has the right to a refund of the overpayment of
    property taxes and can enforce that right by way of action against the
    municipality.  In both cases, the right
    that the owner has is a chose in action.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=SpellE><span lang=EN-US>Choses</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> in action are intangible personal property rights enforceable by
    legal action.  As an intangible personal
    property right that belonged to the Vendor, it could only have been assigned to
    the Purchaser by valid legal or equitable assignment.  For legal assignment to occur, the Vendor
    would have had to expressly assign the right to the Purchaser, in writing.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    on the facts of this case as there was no evidence of an intention to assign
    the chose in action.   </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I turn now to explain why the
    right was not conveyed to the Purchaser, either by the Agreement or by
    operation of the real property statutes.</span></p>

    Purchaser agreed to purchase and the Vendor agreed to sell the “Property” (art.
    2.01).  Article 1.01 of the Agreement contains
    definitions of the significant terms used in the Agreement.   “Property”
    is defined to mean, “collectively the Chattels, the Building, and the Lands”.  “Chattels” is defined as “all goods,
    chattels, fixtures and other tangible personal property owned by the Vendor and
    used by it in its operation and maintenance of the Property which includes,
    without limitation, 265 refrigerators, 265 stoves”.  “Building” is defined as “[the] existing
    building at the Lands and all other structures and fixed improvements located
    on, in or under the Lands belonging to the Vendor”.  “Lands” means “the parcel(s) of land as set

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor does the right fall within

    1.01(f) and 2.01(e) of the Agreement provide that adjustments are to be made to
    taxes, among other things, on closing.  Article 5.02 required the Purchaser to deliver, on closing, an
    undertaking to re-adjust.  In accordance
    with the Statement of Adjustments, realty taxes were adjusted to compensate the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is nothing in s. 306(2)
    or otherwise in the legislation to indicate that the legislature intended to interfere
    with the rights of property owners. Express wording is necessary before the

    rights: see <span class=SpellE><i>Morguard</i></span><i> Properties Ltd. v. Winnipeg (City)</i>,
    [1983] 2 S.C.R. 493 at 511.  Thus, it
    cannot be presumed that in passing the amendment to s. 306, the legislature
    intended to strip the Vendor of the right.    </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rather, in light of the stated
    purpose of Part XIII of the <i>City of
    Toronto Act, 2006</i>, which is to “streamline processes” related to the tax
    roll, it appears that the change to s. 306(2)(a) was one of administrative
    convenience for the City.  The previous language
    – “the City shall refund any overpayment” – left it unclear to <span
class=GramE>whom</span> the City was required to pay the refund.  The language of s. 306(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a),
    as it now stands, relieves the City of the responsibility of determining who is
    entitled to the refund.  Its
    responsibility is limited to paying the refund to the owner of the land as
    shown on the tax roll on the date the adjustment is made.  Thus, any dispute over entitlement is between
    the claimants and not between one or more claimants and the City.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, in my view, s. 306(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) does not provide the Purchaser with a juristic reason
    to retain the refund.  It is simply an
    administrative provision designed to enable the City to pay the refund without
    having to determine who is properly entitled to it.  Section 306 does not affect ownership rights
    nor does it purport to.  While s. 306
    made it lawful for the Purchaser to receive the refund, it does not give the
    Purchaser a juristic reason to withhold the refund from the Vendor. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Vendor effectively overpaid
    taxes on the property during a period in which it owned the property. It was
    the Vendor who took the necessary steps to have the property taxes reassessed.  The right to receive the proceeds of the
    assessment appeal was a chose in action, a personal right belonging to the
    Vendor.  That right did not run with the
    property.  As the Vendor never assigned
    the right to the Purchaser, it is the Vendor who is entitled to the refund.  Section 306(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of
    the <i>City of Toronto Act, 2006</i>, does
    not amount to a juristic reason entitling the Purchaser to retain the
    refund.  Accordingly, the Purchaser must
    disgorge the refund less $22,397.11, the amount that the Vendor agrees it can
    keep.      </span></p>
