  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is largely fact-driven. The trial judge reviewed the
    evidence at large and found, in respect of the lay witnesses, that their
    evidence was “not very impressive” and that on balance, he could not conclude
    from it “whether or not the signature in issue” was a forgery. In the course of
    assessing the lay witnesses, the trial judge considered the frailties in the
    evidence of Ms. Rate and Mr. Byrne, both of whom swore that the deceased signed
    the change of beneficiary forms in their presence on June 15, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the context of Ms. Rate’s evidence, the trial judge noted in
    particular that he had “some difficulty” with her testimony “especially with
    respect to the chronology of events after June 1, 2007”. Importantly, however,
    he noted that her “evidence surrounding the creation of the change of
    beneficiary forms was not shaken”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Rate’s evidence in that regard was critical – and to resolve whether
    he could act on it, as well as Mr. Byrne’s evidence confirming it, he looked to
    the expert handwriting evidence. In doing so, the trial judge carefully
    reviewed the conflicting evidence given by Dr. Singla, on behalf of Piero
    Monaco and Diane Kruger, on behalf of Ms. Rate. In the end, he preferred “the
    opinion of Ms. Kruger that the signature of the deceased Paulo Monaco on the
    change of beneficiary form dated June 15, 2005, was probably written by Paulo
    Monaco”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That finding was open to the trial judge. In coming to it, he made no
    errors in fact or law. In the end, having made that finding, in the context of
    the whole of the evidence, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given my acceptance of the expert evidence of Ms.
    Diane Kruger, and the fact that there is no clear and cogent evidence as to the
    fraud, I find that Piero Monaco has not, on a balance of probabilities, proven
    fraud in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That conclusion was open to the trial judge and it puts to rest the
    appellant’s real complaint, namely, that the verdict is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the other grounds of appeal, we see no merit in the
    submission that the trial judge erred in failing to draw an adverse inference
    against the witness Byrne or failing to comply with his discovery undertakings.
    The appellant took no steps to force Mr. Byrne to comply. Moreover, and in any
    event, the trial judge did not place much, if any, weight on his evidence,
    describing it as “not very impressive”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the trial judge did not err in drawing an adverse inference
    against Ms.&nbsp;Rate for her failure to produce the original change of
    beneficiary forms. Quite simply, on her evidence she did not have the forms to
    produce for the reasons which she explained, all of which went to the central
    issue, namely, whether the deceased’s signature was or was not a forgery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, despite Mr. Sapone’s able argument, the appeal must
    be dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs to the respondent fixed at $12,500 inclusive of disbursements and
    applicable taxes. </p>
