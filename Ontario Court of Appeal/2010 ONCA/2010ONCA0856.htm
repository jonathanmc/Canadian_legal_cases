  <h3>I.          Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until 2006, the operation of privately-run vocational
    schools in Ontario was regulated under the <i>Private
    Career Colleges Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.26 (the “Act”).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  <span class=GramE>The  appellant</span> Superintendent was the
    provincial official responsible for administration of and compliance under the
    Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For approximately nine years (October 1996 to January
    2006), the respondent, Canadian College of Business and Computers Inc.
    (“CCBC”), was registered under the Act to operate a private career college in
    Ontario, providing vocational educational services to both domestic and
    international students.  The respondent,
    Pannirshelvan (Shelvan) Kannuthurai (“Kannuthurai”), is the president and sole
    shareholder of CCBC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In mid-January 2006, the Superintendent proposed to
    revoke CCBC’s registration under the Act due to various concerns regarding
    CCBC’s operations.  After a lengthy
    hearing before the Licence Appeal Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) regarding the Super-intendent’s
    revocation proposal, the Tribunal directed the Superintendent to revoke CCBC’s
    registration.  On appeal to the
    Divisional Court by the respondents, the Tribunal’s decision was set aside and
    a rehearing was ordered on the ground that the original hearing before the
    Tribunal was tainted by a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the
    presiding adjudicator.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent appeals to this court.  She challenges the Divisional Court’s finding
    of bias and its decision to remit the issue of the proposed revocation of
    CCBC’s registration to the Tribunal for rehearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>II.        Facts</h3>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Notice
    of Intention to Revoke</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent was authorized under the Act to
    conduct inspections and examine the operations of private career colleges to ensure
    compliance with the Act (s.&nbsp;13(1)).  She was also empowered to refuse to renew, suspend or revoke the
    registration of a private career college if the registrant failed to satisfy
    the requirements of the Act or associated regulations (s. 6(2)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 5 of the Act and ss. 5, 6 and 20-25 of
    O./Reg. 939, R.R.O. 1990, registration or renewal of registration under the Act
    to conduct or operate a private career college required the operator of the college:
    (1) to be honest and financially responsible in the conduct of the college; (2)
    to employ qualified instructors; and (3) to adhere to prescribed rules
    governing the refund of fees paid by students on their withdrawal or expulsion
    from a vocational program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 19, 2006, the Superintendent delivered a
    notice of intention to revoke and immediately suspend CCBC’s registration under
    the Act, citing concerns about whether CCBC could be expected to conduct its
    private career college in a financially responsible manner, the quality of
    CCBC’s vocational programs, and alleged past conduct of CCBC and Kannuthurai
    that the Superintendent said afforded reasonable grounds for belief that CCBC
    would not carry on its college “in accordance with law and with integrity and honesty”,
    contrary to s. 5 of the Act.  In response,
    the respondents invoked their right under s. 7(2) of the Act to a hearing
    before the Tribunal.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Tribunal
    Decision</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hearing was conducted before a single Tribunal
    hearing officer (the “adjudicator”).  Kannuthurai,
    a non-lawyer, represented himself and CCBC throughout the hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the 25-day hearing, the Tribunal
    held that there was “overwhelming and ample” evidence to substantiate the
    Superintendent’s claim that the respondents’ past conduct afforded reasonable
    grounds for belief that CCBC would not conduct its college operations in
    accordance with law and with integrity and honesty.  In particular, the Tribunal found that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CCBC had overcharged its students and failed to refund
    monies, in the approximate amount of $500,000, owed to 116 students from 13
    countries;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CCBC had misrepresented to the Superintendent that it
    had issued refunds to applicable students;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CCBC had failed to comply with three separate court
    orders requiring it to refund monies to three students;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CCBC’s credit-rating was in the highest risk
    category.  Further, CCBC had exaggerated
    the value of its assets;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CCBC’s landlord had locked it out of its premises for
    eight days due to non-payment of rent, with consequent disruption of student
    programming; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>notwithstanding</span> repeated
    directions from the Super-intendent to CCBC to resolve the issue, CCBC’s
    premises did not comply with applicable municipal fire code requirements,
    thereby exposing CCBC’s students to unsafe and dangerous study conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, in its reasons, the Tribunal made numerous
    strongly-worded adverse credibility findings against Kannuthurai.  For example, the Tribunal found that
    Kannuthurai was “evasive and adversarial during his entire testimony”, that he
    had tried to intimidate several witnesses during his questioning of them, that
    his testimony was “inconsistent and lacked overall credibility”, that he
    “continually tried to mislead the Tribunal”, that he “deliberately and wilfully
    presented misleading evidence to the Tribunal throughout the hearing” and,
    further, that certain of the matters advanced by him at the hearing were
    “frivolous, vexatious and baseless”.  The
    Tribunal’s reasons reveal that these and other adverse credibility findings
    against Kannuthurai were central to the Tribunal’s decision on the merits of
    the Superintendent’s revocation proposal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 28, 2007, the Tribunal ordered the
    Superintendent to revoke CCBC’s registration under the Act.  It also directed the Superintendent to
    develop and take additional remedial steps “to protect the international
    students who might otherwise be misled by [CCBC]” and, in order to partially
    reimburse CCBC’s affected students for outstanding refund claims, ordered the
    forfeiture of a security bond posted by CCBC pursuant to the Act.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Divisional
    Court Decision</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents appealed to the Divisional Court.  They argued that five particular interventions
    by the adjudicator during the hearing gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias, thereby depriving them of procedural fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court concluded that the Tribunal’s
    decision to order the revocation of CCBC’s registration by the Superintendent
    was “amply supported by the evidence” and noted that this decision “was not
    seriously challenged by counsel [for the respondents]” on the appeal before
    that court.  The Divisional Court also
    considered, and rejected, the respondents’ claim that three particular interventions
    by the adjudicator gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  The respondents do not cross-appeal from these
    rulings by the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Divisional Court also concluded that two
    other interventions by the adjudicator, “taken together in the context of these
    proceedings as a whole”, gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias by the
    adjudicator, which necessitated a new hearing before the Tribunal.  These interventions involved:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a statement by the adjudicator, made during Kannu-thurai’s
    examination of the Superintendent, that Kannu-thurai was “misleading the
    Tribunal”; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the “cross-examination” of Kannuthurai by the
    adjudi-cator regarding his possible ties to the Liberation Tigers of the Tamil
    Eelam (“LTTE”), an entity designated by the Canadian government as of April 8,
    2006 as a terrorist group under s. 83.05 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents did not object to these interventions
    during the hearing.  Instead, they first complained
    of them before the Divisional Court, in support of their bias argument.  In response, the Superintendent argued that,
    as a matter of law, the respondents’ failure to object earlier to the impugned
    interventions constituted waiver, thereby precluding the respondents from
    seeking to rely on the interventions to anchor their bias challenge.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court held that the two interventions in
    question gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias that “constitute[d] a
    miscarriage of justice and trump[<span class=GramE>ed</span>] any probability
    that the result of a re-hearing will be the same” and that denied CCBC “the
    procedural fairness to which it was entitled”.  The Divisional Court also rejected the Superintendent’s waiver claim.  Accordingly, by order dated July 7, 2009, the
    Divisional Court allowed the respondents’ appeal, set aside the Tribunal’s
    decision, and remitted the matter back to the Tribunal for re-hearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent appeals.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <h3>III.       Issues</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As framed by the Superintendent, there are three
    issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court err in fashioning a remedy by
    failing to itself decide whether CCBC’s registration under the Act should be
    revoked or, alternatively, by failing to exercise its discretion to refuse to
    grant a remedy altogether?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court err by holding that CCBC had
    not waived its right to allege bias?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court err by holding that certain of
    the adjudicator’s impugned comments gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias?</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>I find it convenient to address these issues in reverse order.</p>
  <h3>IV.       Analysis</h3>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Reasonable
    Apprehension of Bias</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the governing principles regarding claims
    of reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that the Tribunal, as an
    adjudicative administrative body, owed a duty of fairness to the respondents in
    respect of the determination of whether CCBC’s registration should be
    revoked.  As observed by Cory J. in <i>R. v.  <span class=GramE>S.(</span>R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at para. 92,
    “It is a well-established principle that all adjudicative tribunals and
    administrative bodies owe a duty of fairness to the parties who must appear
    before them.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This duty to act fairly included the duty to provide
    procedural fairness.  And, “an unbiased
    appearance is, in itself, an essential component of procedural fairness”: <i>Newfoundland Telephone Co. v. Newfoundland (Board
    of Commissioners of Public Utilities)</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 623, at p. 636.  Thus, the demonstration of a reasonable
    apprehension of bias by the adjudicator would result in a violation of the duty
    of fairness owed to the respondents by the Tribunal.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The well-settled test for establishing a reasonable
    apprehension of bias was set out by de Grandpré J. in his dissenting judgment
    in<i> Committee for Justice and Liberty v.
    Canada (National Energy Board)</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at p. 394: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one
    held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the
    question and obtaining thereon the required information. … [T]hat test is “what
    would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically –
    and having thought the matter through – conclude.  Would he think that it is more likely than
    not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The threshold for a finding of real or perceived bias
    is high.  Mere suspicion is insufficient to
    support an allegation of bias.  Rather, a
    real likelihood or probability of bias must be demonstrated: <i>S<span class=GramE>.(</span>R.D.)</i>, at

  <p class=ParaNO>76, citing de Grandpré J. in <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty</i> at p. 395, the grounds for the
    alleged apprehension of bias must be “substantial”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question whether a reasonable apprehension of bias
    arises is a highly fact-specific inquiry.  See for example, <i>Wewaykum</i>, at
    para. 77.  This court recently indicated
    in <i>Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation
    v. Ontario (Minister of Native Affairs)</i>, 2010 ONCA 47, at para. 230, leave
    to appeal refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 91, that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The test is an objective one.  Thus, the trial record must be assessed in
    its totality and the interventions complained of must be evaluated cumulatively
    rather than as isolated occurrences, from the perspective of a reasonable
    observer throughout the trial.  [Citations
    omitted.]  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Although directed at interventions by a trial judge, I regard
    these comments as equally applicable to interventions by other adjudicative
    decision makers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court also cautioned in <i>Chippewas</i>, at para. 243: “Isolated expressions of impatience or
    annoyance by a judge as a result of frustrations … do not of themselves create
    unfairness.”  As the court explained at
    para. 231:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here are many proper reasons why a trial judge
    may intervene by making comments, giving directions or asking questions during
    the course of a trial.  A trial judge has
    an inherent authority to control the court’s process and, in exercising that
    authority, a trial judge will often be required to intervene in the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Again, these comments are apposite in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is also a strong presumption in favour of the
    impartiality of an adjudicative decision maker: see for example <i>Chippewas</i>, at para. 243; <i>Kelly v. Palazzo</i> (2008), 89 O.R. (3d)
    111 (C.A.), at para. 20, leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 152; <i>Peart v. Peel Regional Police Services Board</i> (2006), 217 O.A.C. 269 (C.A.), at para. 39, leave to appeal refused, [2007]

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the Divisional Court concluded that
    a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from the combined effect of the
    adjudicator’s comment to Kannuthurai that he was “misleading the Tribunal” and
    her subsequent repeated questioning of him concerning his possible association
    or involvement with the LTTE. </p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        The
    “Misleading the Tribunal” Statement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed in the context of the hearing as a whole, the
    adjudicator’s statement that Kannuthurai was “misleading the Tribunal” might
    fairly be seen as nothing more than a poorly phrased rebuke of Kannuthurai during
    the course of a lengthy and no doubt frequently frustrating hearing involving a
    self-represented individual who was unschooled in litigation procedures.  The record makes it abundantly clear that this
    was a difficult hearing to manage.  Further,
    as the Divisional Court observed, “In most respects, the adjudicator afforded
    Mr. Kannuthurai a generous and fair opportunity to present his case and was
    obviously at pains to assist an unrepresented party.”  This observation, with which I agree, is also
    fully supported by the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But that is not the end of the inquiry.  The impugned statement must also be
    considered in the context in which it was made and in relation to the facts and
    circumstances of this particular hearing: <i>Chippewas</i>,
    at paras. 230, 246. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The suggestion that Kannuthurai was “misleading the
    Tribunal” took place during a somewhat lengthy series of questions of
    Kannuthurai by the adjudicator concerning the content and accuracy of a resumé
    of a CCBC teacher filed at the hearing.  The remark was made while Kannuthurai’s examination of the
    Superintendent on the content of the resumé in question was in progress.  Presumably, the purpose of this part of the
    examination was to challenge the Superintendent’s concerns regarding the
    qualifications of CCBC’s instructors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Superintendent points out, the evidence
    concerning the résumé does not figure in the Tribunal’s reasons for
    decision.  That, however, misses the
    point.  The hearing before the Tribunal
    involved allegations of dishonesty, financial improprieties, and conduct akin to
    fraud by Kannuthurai, the principal of CCBC.  Consequently, the cogency of the Superintendent’s evidence in support of
    those allegations and Kannu-thurai’s credibility and reliability were the central
    issues at the hearing.  The Super-intendent,
    therefore, was a key witness from the defence perspective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The assertion that Kannuthurai was “misleading the
    Tribunal” directly challenged his credibility and reliability at a time when he
    was examining a crucial witness on the document that gave rise to the
    adjudicator’s questions.  In this
    context, the adjudicator’s comment takes on added significance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the nature of the comment and the time at which
    it was made, I agree that what the Divisional Court termed the adjudicator’s
    expression of “open disbelief” in what she was being told by Kannuthurai could
    be seen by a reasonable observer of the hearing as indicating that the
    adjudicator had prejudged Kannuthurai’s credibility.  Certainly the remark challenged the
    reliability of the information provided by Kannuthurai in respect of the very document
    about which he was seeking to elicit the Superintendent’s testimony.</p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      The Questions
    Concerning the LTTE </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, and regrettably, the adjudicator’s
    credibility-related questioning of Kannuthurai did not end there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some days after the completion of the Superintendent’s
    evidence, Kannuthurai began his own testimony before the adjudicator.  During his evidence, he outlined his various
    efforts abroad to promote and recruit students to CCBC’s school in
    Ontario.  Among other things, he said
    that he had returned to his native Sri Lanka in 1996 for this purpose but that,
    while there, he was detained in solitary confinement by Sri Lankan authorities
    for 25 days on suspicion of involvement in LTTE terrorist activities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This claim prompted the adjudicator to question
    Kannuthurai about whether he had ever been associated with the LTTE, whether he
    had encountered any other problems with the Sri Lankan authorities, and whether
    Canadian law enforcement officials were involved in investigating Kannuthurai’s
    sponsorship of his fiancée’s immigration application to Canada.  In reply, Kannuthurai said that he had never
    been associated with the LTTE and that, apart from the 25-day detention he had <span
class=GramE>described,</span> he had not experienced other difficulties with
    the Sri Lankan authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court held that the adjudicator’s initial
    questioning on these subjects was intended to clarify Kannuthurai’s evidence
    and, hence, that it was unobjectionable.  This holding is not challenged on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, when the hearing continued on the following
    day, the adjudicator embarked on a second series of questions to Kannuthurai
    about his possible terrorist associations.  On this occasion, she inquired of Kannuthurai as to: (1) whether there
    was “any information on you and any dealings of you with the Tamil Tigers in
    Canada”; (2) the basis of his 25-day detention in Sri Lanka; (3) whether he had
    ever supported the “Tamil Tigers”; and (4) whether he was a member of the “Tamil
    Tigers”.  Read in context, these
    references to the Tamil Tigers meant the LTTE.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of this questioning, the Superintendent’s
    counsel immediately interjected: “[T]hose are not our concerns.  We’re not dealing with that at all.”  The following exchange then took place:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Adjudicator]:                            Yes.  Yes, I know.  But the, the thing is that … as this applicant is alleging a lot of <span
class=GramE>things, that</span> all this happened because there was somebody
    out there to, to get him.  And the
    tribunal has to know, is there something, as he mentioned yesterday, he is
    being stalked, you know, he is being followed around by the, by our
    authorities.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Superintendent’s
    Counsel]:    Right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Adjudicator]:                            So the tribunal has
    one.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Superintendent’s
    Counsel]:    You’re just exploring his
    con-spiracy theory.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Adjudicator]:                            Absolutely.  <span class=GramE>Absolutely.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Superintendent’s
    Counsel]:    I see.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Adjudicator]:                            You know, that, why
    the people were out to get <span class=GramE>him,</span> is there anything
    more, you know?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to this questioning and the adjudicator’s proferred
    explanation for it, the Divisional Court ruled:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These comments cannot fairly be characterized as
    the adjudicator’s attempt to clarify the evidence or to bring rules of evidence
    and procedure to the attention of a self-represented litigant.  The adjudicator … cross-examined
    [Kannuthurai] about his possible ties to a terrorist organization despite his
    evidence that he did not have such ties and despite the fact that this was not
    a basis of the proposal to revoke his licence.  The comments and questions were irrelevant, inappropriate and improper
    in this context.  An informed and
    reasonable observer would likely conclude that the adjudicator had pre-judged
    Mr. Kannuthurai’s credibility.  His
    honesty and integrity were central to the issue before her.  A reasonable person may have concluded that
    the Tribunal had already determined that Mr. Kannuthurai would not operate CCBC
    in accordance with the law, with integrity and with honesty.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>For the reasons that follow, I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Superintendent acknowledges on this appeal, this
    resumed questioning of Kannuthurai about his possible association with the LTTE
    was “inappropriate and of little relevance to the proceeding”.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in her factum, the Superintendent also argues
    that the Divisional Court erred in “extrapolating an appearance of prejudgment
    of credibility on the force of brief inappropriate comments near the end of a
    long and difficult hearing”.  She submits
    that since Kannuthurai made several references during the hearing to a
    conspiracy against him – allegedly involving various Canadian law enforcement
    and national security agencies – the above-described questioning of him by the
    adjudicator, although inappropriate, did not give rise to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias.  Rather, the
    Superintendent says, the adjudicator simply “misdirected herself regarding the
    proper bounds of relevance and pursued too far an issue that could have, and
    likely should have, been left alone”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have already said, I accept that this was a
    lengthy and difficult hearing, which posed significant hearing management
    issues.  In particular, based on the record,
    I recognize that the self-represented respondents raised numerous issues that
    appear to have been wholly irrelevant or extraneous to the matters at issue at
    the hearing.  However, I do not agree
    that the adjudicator’s renewed questioning of Kannuthurai about his possible
    ties to the LTTE was as benign as the Superintendent contends, even when
    considered in the overall context of this protracted hearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As acknowledged by the Superintendent before this
    court, the questions at issue were both irrelevant and improper.  At least inferentially, this was the position
    taken by the Superintendent’s counsel at the hearing, immediately following the
    adjudicator’s questioning.  The questions
    had nothing to do with the matters at issue at the hearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like the Divisional Court, I reject the proposition that
    this renewed line of questioning by the adjudicator was justifiable because it
    reflected an effort by her to clarify Kannuthurai’s conspiracy allegations.  Earlier in the hearing, the adjudicator had
    informed the respondents, in blunt and unambiguous terms, that the Tribunal
    proceeding was not the proper forum in which to pursue these claims, describing
    them as time-consuming and irrelevant “red herring[s]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The adjudicator’s unprompted return to this line of
    questioning, after Kannuthurai had already denied any connection with the LTTE,
    signalled, at the very least, her discomfort with the truthfulness of his
    earlier responses to her questions on this issue.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It bears repeating that Kannuthurai’s credibility and
    integrity were directly engaged at the Tribunal hearing.  Indeed, they went to the heart of the grounds
    advanced by the Superintendent for the proposed revocation of CCBC’s registration
    under the Act.  In this context, the
    questions at issue were neither trivial nor inconsequential.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, I agree with the Divisional
    Court that the adjudicator’s remarks on this occasion, viewed together with her
    earlier assertion that Kannuthurai had misled the Tribunal, created an
    appearance of unfairness such that an objective observer of the hearing would
    reasonably conclude that she had pre-judged Kannuthurai’s credibility.  It follows that the Divisional Court was
    correct to conclude that the requisite high threshold to establish a reasonable
    apprehension of bias was met.</p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Waiver</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In rejecting the Superintendent’s waiver claim, the
    Divisional Court reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While as a general rule bias allegations should be
    made directly and promptly, the most egregious comments arose on the twenty-third
    day of a twenty-five day hearing.  [Kannuthurai’s] failure to raise concerns about comments made so late in
    the hearing does not reflect adversely on the genuineness of the apprehension
    of bias in these circum-stances.  The litigant
    was self-represented and there is no suggestion that he held back as a tactic
    or to avoid an explanation by the adjudicator.  As well, given that the<i> </i>allegations
    arise solely from the record, a decision of the adjudicator on this issue would
    not shed additional light on the facts that form the basis of the allegations.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>I also agree with the Divisional Court’s analysis of this
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that where the facts giving rise to a
    possible apprehension of bias become apparent during the course of a hearing,
    it is incumbent on the party affected “to put the allegation and the facts on
    which that party is relying to the decision maker at the earliest possible
    moment”: see David J. Mullan, <i>Essentials
    of Canadian Law, Administrative Law</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2001), at p.
    348.  See also <i>R. v. Curragh Inc.</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537, at para. 11; <i>Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor</i>,
    [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892, at pp. 941-43.  In
    that way, the challenged decision maker is afforded an opportunity to set out
    its position regarding the bias claim and a reviewing court will have the
    benefit of a complete record on the issue.  This obligation assumes, however, that the pertinent facts are apparent
    to the affected party and that a voluntary and informed decision might be made
    whether to advance a bias claim based on those facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brown and Evans, in <i>Judicial
    Review of Administrative Action in Canada</i>, looseleaf (Toronto: Canvasback
    Publication, 2010) at 11-77 – 11-78, note that objections on the ground of bias
    are generally deemed to have been waived if the affected party knew of the
    grounds for the bias claim and acquiesced in the proceedings “by failing to
    take objection at the earliest practicable opportunity” unless, for example,
    the affected party “was unrepresented by counsel and did not know of his right
    to object at the time” (quoting Woolf, Jowell and LeSueur, <i>De Smith’s Judicial Review</i>, 6th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
    2007), c. 10-055ff).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to keep in mind that CCBC and
    Kannuthurai were self-represented litigants.  Nothing on the record suggests that Kannuthurai, on his own or CCBC’s behalf,
    appreciated prior to the completion of the hearing that the adjudicator’s
    impugned comments might give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias claim
    and, knowing that, that the respondents withheld their allegation of bias for
    use only if the outcome of the hearing was adverse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, in the absence of some contrary indication
    in the record, it is unlikely that these self-represented respondents, although
    obviously aware of the adjudicator’s comments, were also aware of their right
    to object to the comments during the hearing on the basis of bias and that they
    elected not to do so at the first opportune moment for tactical or strategic
    reasons.  This case is therefore
    distinguishable from those cases in which the affected party knew or was
    advised, during the proceeding at issue, of a potential bias claim and chose
    not to object: see for example, <i>Stetler
    v. Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Appeal Tribunal</i> (2005), 76 O.R. (3d)
    321 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 428.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Taylor</i>, a
    case relied on by the Superintendent to support her waiver <span class=GramE>claim,</span> the matter of bias was not raised until almost eight years after the tribunal
    hearing and, even then, was only raised in a collateral proceeding.  And in <i>Taylor</i> at p. 972, McLachlin J. (as she then was), suggested in respect of a bias claim
    (in dissent, although not on this point), that the fact that the affected party
    did not have counsel would militate against a finding of waiver where there was
    some delay in raising the bias objection.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the facts giving rise to a potential bias
    claim emerged in the final days of the Tribunal hearing.  The respondents advanced their bias argument
    as soon as they had retained counsel to conduct their appeal to the Divisional
    Court.  That appeal was undertaken on a
    timely basis.  I am satisfied that this is
    sufficient to defeat an argument of waiver.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Remedy</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to what I regard as the core issue on this
    appeal, namely, the appropriateness of the remedy granted by the Divisional
    Court as a result of the perception of unfairness arising from the adjudicator’s
    conduct.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent argues that, having found that the
    Superintendent had a strong and largely uncontested case, the Divisional Court
    should itself have determined the question of whether CCBC’s registration under
    the Act should be revoked or, alternatively, that the Divisional Court should
    have exercised its discretion to refuse to grant a remedy altogether.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that the Divisional Court, sitting on
    appeal from the Tribunal’s decision, had the power under s. 134(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43,
    (the “<i>CJA</i>”) to: (1) make any order or
    decision that ought to or could have been made by the Tribunal; (2) order a new
    hearing; or (3) make any other order considered to be just.  This power was limited only by the
    requirement that a new hearing should not be ordered unless some substantial
    wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred: s. 134(6) <i>CJA</i>.  As I have said, the
    Superintendent contends that the Divisional Court also had the authority, in
    the exercise of its discretion, to deny any remedy at all, notwithstanding its
    finding of bias by the adjudicator, if the interests of justice so
    warranted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is some force to the Superintendent’s attack on
    the remedy chosen by the Divisional Court.  Not every breach of fairness or natural justice necessitates a new
    hearing; in exceptional cases, the court can exercise its discretion to deny a
    remedy: see for example, <i>Mining Watch
    Canada v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans)</i>, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 6, at paras.
    51-52; <i>Mobil Oil Ltd. v.
    Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 202, at pp.

    v. Canada (Minister of Transport)</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 76-78.  That said<span class=GramE>,</span> I would
    not interfere with the Divisional Court’s disposition regarding remedy for
    several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it appears that the Superintendent did not
    request the Divisional Court to make its own determination concerning the
    Superintendent’s revocation proposal.  Further, on the record before this court, it is unclear whether the
    Superintendent argued before the Divisional Court that no remedy should be
    granted in the circumstances of this case since, the Superintendent asserts, the
    result on any rehearing would be the same.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, the Divisional Court’s reasons
    indicate that it was mindful of its discretionary power to refuse a remedy and,
    further, that it considered the issue of the utility of a rehearing and the
    potential unnecessary expenditure of resources, given the strength of the
    Superintendent’s case.  In the Divisional
    Court’s view, however, the finding of a reasonable apprehension of bias
    constituted a miscarriage of justice and “trump[ed] any probability that the
    result of a re-hearing will be the same”.  It is therefore clear that the Divisional Court did not fail to consider
    and did not give inadequate weight to the strength of the Superintendent’s case
    when fashioning a remedy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, I underscore that the adjudicator’s bias in
    this case occasioned a breach of the Tribunal’s duty of fairness to the
    respondents.  The nature of that breach
    resulted in the denial to the respondents of a full and fair hearing before an
    impartial decision maker, as was their right.  Hearing fairness was therefore compromised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, where a reasonable apprehension of bias
    by an adjudicative decision maker is made out, as in this case, a new hearing
    is ordinarily the only appropriate remedy.  The right to a full and fair hearing by an impartial decision maker is
    of fundamental importance to our system of justice, including in the
    administrative law domain: see <i>Curragh</i>,
    at para. 7.  Indeed, the right to trial
    by an impartial tribunal is now enshrined in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  This right is particularly significant where,
    as here, the proceeding at issue involves self-represented litigants.  I find it difficult to envisage a situation
    where, bias by an adjudicative decision maker having been established, a new
    hearing will be refused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take comfort in this view from the Supreme Court’s
    decision in <i>Newfoundland Telephone Co. </i>in
    which the court stated at p. 645, quoting <i>Cardinal
    v. Director of Kent Institution</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643, at p. 661:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he denial of a right to a fair hearing must
    always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a reviewing
    court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different decision.  The right to a fair hearing must be regarded
    as an independent, unqualified right which finds its essential justification in
    the sense of procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative
    decision is entitled to have.  It is not
    for a court to deny that right and sense of justice on the basis of speculation
    as to what the result might have been had there been a hearing.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>See also <i>Curragh</i>, at
    para. <span class=GramE>5; <i>Marchand
    (Litigation guardian of) v. Public General Hospital Society of Chatham</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), at para.</span> 131, leave to appeal refused,
    [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 66.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize that the above-quoted principle enunciated
    in <i>Cardinal</i> has sometimes been
    overstated in subsequent cases.  In that
    regard, I agree with the following observation of the Federal Court of Appeal
    in <i>Uniboard Surfaces Inc. v. Kronotex
    Fussboden GmbH and Co. K.G.</i>, [2007] 4 F.C.R. 101, at para. 13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To say that <i>Cardinal </i>stands for the proposition that any breach of any requirement of the duty
    of procedural fairness renders a decision invalid, or that any breach of any
    procedural rule constitutes a breach of the duty of procedural fairness, or
    that a court has no discretion to deny the relief sought, is to read the
    reasons of the Supreme Court of Canada out of context. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, for example, where the nature of the breach of procedural
    fairness is inconsequential, trivial or merely technical in nature, a reviewing
    court may determine to deny the discretionary remedy of a rehearing: see <i>Uniboard</i>, at para. 24.  That said, as I will explain, the breach of
    fairness in this case is far removed from the realm of merely inconsequential,
    trivial or technical matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent relies on <i>Young v. British Columbia College of Teachers</i>, [1999] B.C.J. No.
    1908 (B.C.S.C.), aff’d (2001), 198 D.L.R. (4th) 292 (B.C.C.A.) and <i>Lisyikh v. Canadian Law Enforcement Training
    College</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 3621 (S.C.) to argue that, in exceptional cases (for
    instance, where no useful purpose would be served by requiring a rehearing), the
    court may dismiss an appeal notwithstanding a breach of procedural
    fairness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think that these cases assist the
    Superintendent.  <i>Young</i> is the only case identified by the Superintendent where the
    remedy of a rehearing was denied in a bias case.  However, in <i>Young</i>, the events giving rise to the appearance of unfairness based
    on bias took place after the completion of the hearing on the merits and after
    the misconduct alleged against the aggrieved party had been admitted by him.  Only the penalty phase of the hearing was
    affected.  Moreover, in <i>Young</i>, the appellant did not seek a
    rehearing as a remedy for the perception of bias by the involved decision maker
    but, rather, was content to have the matter at issue determined by the
    reviewing court on the basis of the available record.  In <i>Lisyikh</i>,
    the procedural fairness deficiencies at issue did not relate to bias
    allegations.  The deficiencies in that
    case involved notice defects that were found to be “more formal than
    substantial” (at para. 44).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the procedural unfairness was bias – a defect
    that tainted the respondents’ fundamental right to an impartial hearing.  As indicated by a majority of the Supreme
    Court in <i>S<span class=GramE>.(</span>R.D.)</i>,
    at para. 100:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a reasonable apprehension of bias arises, it
    colours the entire trial proceedings and it cannot be cured by the correctness
    of the subsequent decision. …  Thus, the
    mere fact that the judge appears to make proper findings of credibility on
    certain issues or comes to the correct result cannot alleviate the effects of a
    reasonable apprehension of bias arising from other words or conduct of the
    judge.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the bias in this case arose during the
    course of a hearing in which the respondents’ ability to continue to earn a
    livelihood through the operation of a private career college was at stake.  The seriousness of this issue for the
    respondents lends additional force to the need to preserve hearing fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of these considerations, I see no basis on
    which to interfere with the Divisional Court’s discretionary decision to
    require a rehearing in this case.  I
    would add that the rehearing should be conducted by a different Tribunal
    adjudicator.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would dismiss the
    appeal.  The respondents are entitled to
    their costs of the appeal and of the application for leave to appeal to this
    court, fixed in the total amount of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and all
    applicable taxes.</p>

    that, when dealing with an allegation of a breach of natural justice or of
    procedural fairness, it is unnecessary to address the question of the

    (C.A.), at para. 10.</p>
