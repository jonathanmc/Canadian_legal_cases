  <h4 style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-US>I.          Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suresh Sriskandarajah is wanted in the United States to
    stand trial on terrorism charges for his alleged assistance of the Liberation
    Tigers of the Tamil Eelam (the “LTTE”), for the purpose of enhancing the LTTE’s
    ability to engage in terrorism.  In
    particular, Sriskandarajah is alleged to have acquired aviation equipment,
    submarine and warship design software and other communications equipment for
    members of the LTTE.  Sriskandarajah is
    also said to have laundered money for the LTTE and to have counselled
    individuals on methods of smuggling goods to the LTTE in Sri Lanka.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 20, 2006, the Minister of Justice issued an
    Authority to Proceed under s. 15 of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18 (the “Act”) to seek a committal order against
    Sriskandarajah.  On October 9, 2007, a
    replacement Authority to Proceed was issued, in which the following Canadian
    criminal offences were listed as corresponding to the alleged criminal conduct
    for which Sriskandarajah’s committal into custody for extradition to the United
    States is sought: (1) participating in the activity of a terrorist group,
    contrary to s. 83.18 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46; (2) providing, making available, etc. property or
    services for terrorist purposes, contrary to s. 83.03 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>; and (3) instructing to
    carry out activity for a terrorist group, contrary to s. 83.21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order of Pattillo J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice dated March 5, 2008, Sriskandarajah was committed into custody for
    extradition.  On November 17, 2009, the
    Minister of Justice ordered his surrender to the United States.  Sriskandarajah appeals against the committal
    order and also applies for judicial review of the Minister’s surrender order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sriskandarajah’s extradition hearing was held together
    with that of Piratheepan Nadarajah, who is also wanted in the United States to
    stand trial for unrelated alleged terrorist activity involving the LTTE.  Like Sriskandarajah, Nadarajah was committed
    into custody for extradition and subsequently ordered surrendered to the United
    States by the Minister of Justice.  This court
    heard Nadarajah’s appeal from his committal order and his application for
    judicial review of the Minister’s surrender order together with this appeal and
    judicial review application.  Our reasons
    for decision in Nadarajah’s proceedings are being released concurrently with
    these reasons.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At their extradition hearings, both Sriskandarajah and
    Nadarajah attacked the constitutionality of certain provisions of Canada’s
    anti-terrorism laws.  In particular, they
    argued that the statutory definition of “terrorist activity” set out in s.
    83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>, and its operation throughout
    the terrorism provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    including, in particular, s.&nbsp;83.18, violated their rights under ss. 2(b), 2(d)
    and 7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</i> and should be declared unconstitutional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this court, Sriskandarajah joined with Nadarajah
    in renewing their ss. 2(b) and 7<i> Charter</i> arguments.  Neither party pursued the s.
    2(d) <i>Charter</i> argument.  Counsel for Nadarajah carried the
    constitutional arguments in this court.  We address the merits of those arguments in our reasons in <i>Nadarajah</i>, released concurrently.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sriskandarajah also argues that his committal order cannot
    be supported by the evidence and, hence, that it is unreasonable.  He submits, in particular, that there was no
    evidence before the extradition judge that he knew that any of his dealings
    were with LTTE members, that he intended his activities to benefit the LTTE, or
    that he acted for the purpose of enhancing the LTTE’s ability to facilitate or
    carry out terrorist activity.  Sriskandarajah maintains that, as there was no evidence to support
    essential elements of the Canadian offences set out in the Authority to
    Proceed, his committal order was unreasonable and should be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in support of his judicial review application,
    Sriskandarajah contends that in making his surrender order, the Minister of
    Justice denied him procedural fairness, failed to consider several relevant
    factors, and failed to take account of the submissions and materials placed
    before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to these arguments.  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that
    Sriskandarajah’s appeal and judicial review application must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       Discussion</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Constitutional Challenge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given in <i>Nadarajah</i>, the constitutional arguments fail.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Reasonableness of Committal Order</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge’s reasons for committal reveal that
    he properly directed himself on the applicable test for committal, set out
    under s. 29(1)(a) of the Act and discussed in <i>United States of America v. Ferras</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 77; <i>United States of America v. Thomlison</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No.
    179; <i>United States of America v. Anderson</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 380 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No.
    159.  As the extradition judge indicated,
    that test is met “if there is some <span class=GramE>evidence, that</span> is
    available for trial and not manifestly unreliable, on every essential element
    of the parallel Canadian crime, upon which a jury properly instructed, could
    convict”: <i>Thomlison</i>, at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence before the extradition judge in this case
    was contained in original and supplemental records of the case certified as
    being available for trial and sufficient under the laws of the United States to
    justify prosecution against Sriskandarajah by the responsible prosecuting
    authority in New York State in accordance with s. 33 of the Act and Article
    10(2) of the <i>Treaty on Extradition between
    the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America</i>,
    3 December 1971, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3, as amended by 11 January 1988, Can. T.S.
    1991 No. 37 (the “Treaty”).  The same
    records of the case were used in support of the committal request involving
    Nadarajah and in separate proceedings involving Ramanan Mylvaganam: <i>United States of America v. Mylvaganam</i> (2009), 254 O.A.C. 1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge reviewed the evidence against
    Sriskandarajah in detail.  It included
    the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sriskandarajah displayed pictures of LTTE-controlled
    territory in Sri Lanka on his personal website, including a picture of a large
    communications tower with satellite dishes;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an email in Sriskandarajah’s email account included a
    logo for an organization called “NTAB” that consisted of the LTTE “tiger”
    symbol and satellite dishes;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in a September 2004 email from Sriskandarajah to Tha-varjah
    Pratheepan, a senior LTTE arms and technology procurement agent, and an
    individual called “Elil”, Sriskandarajah stated that he was ready to buy equip-ment
    and parts for communication towers on receipt of further information;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in a March 2005 email, Sriskandarajah provided Pra-theepan
    with the name of a contact who worked on air traffic radars at a large military
    contracting company;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>also in March 2005, Sriskandarajah and two others, allegedly
    acting on behalf of an LTTE leader, transferred $13,150 in LTTE funds through
    bank accounts in the United States to a travel agent to pay the costs for two
    individuals to travel to LTTE controlled territory in Sri Lanka;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>in</span> October 2005,
    Sriskandarajah directed three students to smuggle various property and
    equipment, including computer and GPS items, past Sri Lankan officials into
    Tamil territory.  He provided the
    students with detailed instructions on how to deceive Sri Lankan customs
    officials to carry out the directed smuggling. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Sriskandarajah’s
    directions to the students included instructions to advise LTTE territory check-point
    personnel that, “Waterloo Suresh sent you and you need to see Elil”.  Sriskandarajah also told the students, “I
    need to know you arrived safely and more importantly all the things got there
    safely”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(7)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>some</span> months later, in March
    2006, Sriskandarajah directed Ramanan Mylvaganam on how to obtain information
    regarding the purchase of submarine and warship design software, valued at
    approximately $22,000, from a company in the United Kingdom.  He also provided Mylvaganam with false
    information and a false purchase order to furnish to the vendor to <span
class=GramE>effect</span> the purchase.  Sriskandarajah also arranged for payment of the software purchase price;</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(9)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in April 2006, Mylvaganam forwarded various com-munications
    devices to Sriskandarajah, valued in excess of $22,000, that had been purchased
    from a company in California; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(10)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sriskandarajah instructed Mylvaganam to wire transfer
    over $5,000 to two smouldering equipment distributor companies in Singapore and
    Mylvaganam did so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sriskandarajah admitted, and the extradition judge was
    satisfied, that he was the person named in the request for extradition by the United
    States.  The issue, therefore, was
    whether, on assessment by the extradition judge, the evidence in the records of
    the case was sufficient to justify a committal order against Sriskandarajah on
    the Canadian offences identified in the Authority to Proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge concluded that the test for
    committal had been satisfied.  He held at
    para. 105 of his reasons:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is some evidence [Sriskandarajah] assisted
    Mr. Pratheepan, a senior procurement officer for the LTTE, in respect of the
    purchase of communications equipment.  There is some evidence that he was involved with an individual in the
    United States in the purchase or attempted purchase of submarine and warship
    design software, communications equipment and other technology.  There was some evidence that Mr.
    Sriskandarajah was involved in smuggling equip-ment to the LTTE in Sri
    Lanka.  There is also some evidence that
    he was involved in the laundering of money through bank accounts in the United
    States to enable two individuals to travel to LTTE controlled territory in Sri
    Lanka.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the LTTE itself, there was evidence in
    the records of the case that an expert was expected to testify at
    Sriskandarajah’s trial about the background, structure, leadership, methods of
    operation and activities of the LTTE, including suicide bombings and political
    assassinations carried out by the LTTE. This evidence, if accepted, could
    establish that the LTTE is a terrorist group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sriskandarajah asserts, as he did before the
    extradition judge, that the evidence of an unnamed expert cannot be relied upon
    as reliable evidence of the LTTE’s status as a terrorist group.  However, he concedes on appeal that the
    Canadian government’s listing of the LTTE as a terrorist group pursuant to s.
    83.05 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as of
    April 8, 2006, prior to the date of the Authority to Proceed, suffices to
    establish that the LTTE is a terrorist group, an essential element of the
    Canadian offences alleged against Sriskan-darajah. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on his review of the evidence in the records of
    the case, the extradition judge concluded that there was some evidence in
    respect of each essential element of the offences under ss. 83.18, 83.03 and
    83.21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> alleged
    against Sriskandarajah upon which a properly instructed jury could
    convict.  We see no reversible error in
    this conclusion.  On the contrary, in our
    view, it was amply supported by the evidence before the extradition judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Sriskandarajah renews his argument that the
    evidence in the records of the case fell short of establishing that he knew of
    the LTTE or that his activities were carried out with the intention of
    benefiting the LTTE and for the purpose of enhancing the LTTE’s ability to facilitate
    or carry out a terrorist activity.  Essentially,
    he asserts that there was no evidence before the extradition judge of the
    requisite <i>mens rea</i> for the offences
    listed in the Authority to Proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge considered and rejected Sriskandarajah’s
    assertion that these and other alleged evidentiary shortcomings compelled the
    refusal of a committal order.  He
    reasoned as follows at para. 109:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While individually each of the identified pieces of
    evidence may not connect Mr. Sriskandarajah to the LTTE or indicate his
    knowledge of it, when the evidence against him is viewed as a whole, there is
    certainly some evidence in my view from which a jury properly instructed could
    make that finding.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence against Sriskandarajah, while mostly
    circumstantial, was extensive.  The
    extradition judge correctly assessed that evidence as a whole.  In light of the contents of the records of
    the case, in part described in paragraphs 13 and 16 above, the extradition
    judge was fully justified in concluding that there was some evidence which, if
    accepted, could lead a properly instructed jury to conclude that Sriskandarajah
    knew of the LTTE and that he knowingly contributed to LTTE activities with the
    intention that his activities benefit the LTTE and for the purpose of enhancing
    the LTTE’s ability to facilitate or carry out terrorist activity.  We agree with the Crown’s submission that the
    inferences drawn by the extradition judge regarding the <i>mens rea</i> of the alleged s. 83.18 <span class=GramE>offence</span> (participating in or contributing to any activity of a terrorist group) were
    reasonable and supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reach a similar conclusion regarding the evidence
    pertaining to the remaining Canadian offences set out in the Authority to
    Proceed.  Simply put, we agree with the
    extradition judge that there was some evidence in the records of the case
    which, if accepted, could lead a properly instructed jury to conclude that
    Sriskandarajah acted contrary to ss. 83.03 (providing, making available etc.,
    property or services for terrorist purposes) and 83.21 (instructing to carry
    out any activity for a terrorist group) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in relation to and in support of the LTTE.  This included evidence of Sriskandarajah’s collection
    and provision of, or making available, various types of property for the use or
    benefit of the LTTE, his instructions to Mylvaganam in March of 2006 to obtain
    submarine and warship design software, and his directions to students in
    October 2005 on methods to successfully smuggle equipment into LTTE controlled
    territory in Sri Lanka.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no basis on which to interfere
    with the extradition judge’s committal order.</p>

lang=EN-US>      Attack on Surrender Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also reject Sriskandarajah’s attack on the
    Minister’s surrender decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sriskandarajah’s complaint that he was denied
    procedural fairness at the surrender stage of the extradition process rests on
    his contention that the Minister was obliged to disclose the assessment of the
    Canadian prosecuting authorities concerning the feasibility of prosecution in
    Canada, conducted in accordance with <i>United
    States of America v. Cotroni</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469.  Nadarajah advanced an identical argument on
    his judicial review application.  This
    contention is flawed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons in support of his surrender order, the
    Minister confirmed that: (1) he had provided Sriskandarajah with all
    non-privileged materials that he considered in making his surrender decision,
    including a copy of the document containing the conclusion of the Canadian
    prosecuting authorities on their <i>Cotroni</i> inquiry; (2) he had not been furnished with a copy of the <i>Cotroni</i> assessment itself; and (3) he conducted his own independent
    analysis of the <i>Cotroni</i> factors,
    having regard to all the materials before him, the results of which were set
    out in his reasons.  In all these
    circumstances, the non-disclosure of the <i>Cotroni</i> assessment did not impair procedural fairness and the Minister’s decision not
    to provide a copy of the requested <i>Cotroni</i> assessment was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also do not accept Sriskandarajah’s claim that the
    Minister failed to take account of relevant factors, submissions and materials
    in deciding to order his surrender.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Sriskandarajah acknowledges in his factum, the
    Minister expressly considered a number of relevant factors in his assessment of
    whether surrender would be a justifiable limitation on Sriskandarajah’s s. 6(1) <i>Charter</i> rights.  Sriskandarajah argues, however, that the
    Minister acted unreasonably by failing to consult with the relevant authorities
    in the United States about the current status of his co-accused and by failing
    to consider his alleged inability to challenge, in the United States, the
    lawfulness of a search of his residence conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted
    Police.  He further submits that the evidence
    discloses a “highly tenuous link, if any, between [his] conduct and the
    interests of the United States”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  As
    we have said, the Minister stated in his reasons that he had conducted his own <i>Cotroni</i> inquiry.  There is no basis on the record before us to
    doubt that the Minister did precisely what he said he had done.  Moreover, the Minister was not obliged to
    refer expressly to each <i>Cotroni</i> factor in his reasons: see <i>United States
    of America v. Lake</i> (2006), 212 C.C.C. (3d) 51 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 29,
    affirmed [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761.  Thus, his
    failure to indicate in his reasons whether he had confirmed the status of
    Sriskandarajah’s co-accused, or his failure to comment on Sriskandarajah’s
    assertion that he would be unable to challenge the lawfulness of the search of
    his residence in a trial held outside Canada, does not render his surrender
    decision unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, the Minister detailed in his reasons
    the basis for his conclusion that surrendering Sriskandarajah to the United States
    was a justifiable breach of Sriskandarajah’s s. 6 <i>Charter</i> right to remain in Canada.  The reasons reveal that the Minister weighed and balanced the interests
    and ability of the United States to prosecute Sriskandarajah against those
    factors that arguably favoured his prosecution in Canada.  The Minister noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[S]ince 1999, agents of the United States Federal
    Bureau of Investigation and other United States law enforcement personnel have
    been investigating individuals and charitable organizations that allegedly
    provide material support to the LTTE. It is this investigation which linked Mr.
    Sriskan-darajah to the LTTE and which is the basis of the allegation that Mr.
    Sriskandarajah was involved in providing material support to the LTTE in the
    period from September 2004 to April 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this court has said, “The Minister is entitled to
    rely on the validity of the assertion of jurisdiction made by the requesting
    state” and, further, “[T]he determination of jurisdiction of the foreign court
    is a matter first for the foreign authorities and ultimately for the foreign
    court”: <i>United States of America v.
    Kavaratzis</i> (2006), 208 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 10.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Minister explicitly addressed, among
    other factors, the interests of the United States in prosecuting
    Sriskandarajah, the genesis of the allegations against him, the fact of
    Sriskandarajah’s Canadian citizenship, the place where his conduct is alleged
    to have been committed, the fact that the search of his residence in Canada was
    conducted at the request of authorities in the United States, and the fact that
    no charges have been laid and none are contemplated in Canada.  Based on his review of these and other
    considerations, the Minister determined that the United States has the superior
    interest in prosecuting Sriskandarajah.  The Minister put it this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the circumstances of this case, insofar as the
    investigation was initiated and developed by the American authorities, all of
    the co-accused have been charged there, and most of the witnesses are located
    there, it would not in my view be an unjustifiable breach of Mr.
    Sriskandarajah’s section 6 <i>Charter</i> rights to surrender him to face prosecution in the United States.  Nor am I persuaded that this is a case where
    surrender would be either unjust or oppressive under paragraph 44(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span><i>a</i>) of the Act or
    would otherwise warrant a refusal of surrender under the <i>Treaty</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As appears from these comments, and contrary to
    Sriskandarajah’s submission, the evidence before the Minister revealed strong
    links between Sriskandarajah’s conduct and the interests of the United
    States.  The Minister’s assessment of the
    strength of those interests in this case attracts considerable deference from a
    reviewing court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, we are not persuaded that the Minister’s
    surrender decision is unreasonable.  On
    the contrary, we think that it is fully supported by the evidence in this case.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given, both the appeal and judicial
