  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 8, 2009, the appellant, Zakaria Amara,
    entered pleas of guilty before Durno J. of the Superior Court of Justice on the
    following two counts in an indictment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[B]etween the lst day of March 2005 and the 2nd day
    of June 2006, in the City of Mississauga, in the City of Toronto, in the City
    of Fort Erie, in the Township of Ramara, in the Township of Guelph/Eramosa and
    elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, and in the country of Pakistan, [did] knowingly
    participate in or contribute to, directly or indirectly, any activity of a
    terrorist group, namely Fahim Ahmad and others, for the purpose of enhancing
    the ability of the terrorist group to facilitate or carry out  terrorist activity, thereby committing an
    offence contrary to s. 83.18(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[B]etween the lst day of March 2006 and the 2nd day
    of June 2006, in the City of Mississauga, in the City of Toronto, in the
    Township of Ramara and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, did commit an
    indictable offence to wit, doing anything with intent to cause an explosion of
    an explosive substance that was likely to cause serious bodily harm or death to
    persons or was likely to cause serious damage to property, contrary to s.&nbsp;81(1)(a)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, for the benefit
    of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group, namely
    Zakaria Amara and others, thereby committing an offence contrary to s. 83.2 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge referred to the first count as the
    “camp plot” and the second count as the “bomb plot”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 18, 2010, the appellant was sentenced on the
    camp plot to 21 months’ imprisonment. In arriving at that sentence, the
    sentencing judge credited the appellant with 7 years and 3 months for the 43 months
    and 18 days he had spent in pre-sentence custody. Hence, on that count, the
    appellant received the equivalent of a 9-year sentence. The appellant does not
    contest that sentence on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of the bomb plot, the appellant was
    sentenced to life imprisonment. Under s.&nbsp;743.6(1.2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, the
    sentencing judge fixed the period of the appellant’s parole ineligibility at 10
    years from the date of his arrest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal from the life
    sentence imposed in connection with the bomb plot and if leave is granted,
    requests that his sentence be reduced to a fixed term of 18 to 20 years, to be
    served consecutively to the 21-month sentence imposed on the camp plot. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, we would grant leave to appeal
    but dismiss the appeal from sentence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Offence
    and the Appellant’s Role in it</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We find it unnecessary to describe at length the facts
    relating to the bomb plot. Suffice it to say that the appellant was the
    mastermind and chief organizer of a plot in which bombs were to be detonated at
    the Toronto Stock Exchange Tower, the CSIS Headquarters on Front Street in
    Toronto, and an unspecified military base east of Toronto.  These three buildings were to be blown up
    during the morning rush hour. As the sentencing judge observed at para. 102,
    had the plot succeeded, “the results would have been catastrophic.” It would
    have led to “multiple death[s] and injuries” and “changed the lives of many, if
    not all Canadians forever.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike his co-conspirators, Saad Khalid and Saad Gaya,
    whose sentences are also under review by this court,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> the appellant did not feign ignorance at the sentencing hearing as to the loss
    of life and human carnage that would have resulted had the plot succeeded. He
    knew full well that hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people would die or
    be gravely injured if everything went according to his plan. And yet, he went
    ahead despite this – or perhaps because of it –under the misguided belief that
    the greater the harm, the greater the likelihood that Canada would rethink its
    foreign policy in Afghanistan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Driven by his violent Jihadist convictions, the
    appellant plotted and schemed for months, schooled himself in the science of
    bomb-making, recruited underlings to assist him, used tactics designed to reduce
    the chances of detection, and played a central role in every important decision
    that was made to further the conspiracy. As the sentencing judge observed at
    paras. 107-108: “The meticulous details for the bomb plot were provided by
    Zakaria Amara.”  Further, his plan “was
    thoroughly researched and meticulously planned to the point that detailed
    instructions were given to those who did not know all the plans. The plans even
    included his fleeing the country right after the detonations.”</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Offender</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge was alive to the appellant’s
    positive attributes and to the various mitigating factors he advanced.  He noted that the appellant was a young man
    (20 years old when arrested) and that he was a first offender. He acknowledged the
    appellant’s guilty plea and took that into account, along with evidence from the
    appellant, his family, and a psychiatrist retained by him, in concluding that the
    appellant was remorseful.  He also
    observed at para. 112 that the guilty <span class=GramE>plea “save[</span>d]
    court time and the public the expense of a trial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge further acknowledged the appellant’s
    family responsibilities as a husband and the father of a young child, and the
    support that his family had provided to him and would continue to offer in the
    future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the sentencing judge considered the psychiatric
    evidence put forward on the appellant’s behalf.  He found it to be of some assistance, in that
    it provided “some evidence” that the appellant had “the capacity to change.”  However, in his view, it was too early to realistically
    assess the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation.  He noted at para. 95:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The depth of the offender’s commitment and
    ideological beliefs <i>may</i> be changing,
    but a few months in the general population with inmates, four hours with the
    doctor, and his apparently sincere comments in court, require a circumspect
    assessment at this time. The depth and duration of his commitment will best be
    known in the future.  <span class=GramE>[Emphasis
    in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the most the sentencing judge could say was
    that the appellant had “the capacity to be rehabilitated” (at para. 125).
    However, he added that “given the circumstances of this offence and this
    offender, those prospects are guarded at this stage.”</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Sentence of Life Imprisonment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having reviewed in considerable detail the
    circumstances surrounding the bomb plot, the appellant’s background and
    character, the aggravating and mitigating factors, the governing principles of
    sentencing and sentences imposed in other terrorism cases, the sentencing judge
    concluded at paras. 156 and 158 that the appellant should receive a life
    sentence for his participation in the bomb plot:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As regards the bomb plot, <span class=GramE>again
    having</span> considered all the circumstances of the case, I am persuaded that
    this is one of those rarest of cases where the maximum sentence of life is
    appropriate for this offender for committing this offence in this community. I
    acknowledge the exceptional nature of maximum sentences and particularly so
    where it is a life sentence for a young, first offender. However, the truly
    exceptional nature of this offence leads to the conclusion that that is the
    only appropriate sentence in these circumstances. In my view the circumstances
    warrant imposing the maximum sentence, as the Supreme Court of Canada has
    indicated. Having reached that conclusion, I must impose that sentence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am well aware of the concern expressed in
    appellate authorities that sentences should not be such as to crush the hopes
    for rehabilitation and eventual release. I have given that principle as well as
    all the circumstances of this case most anxious consideration. However, the
    offender will be eligible for full parole in 6 years and 3 ½ months. He is a
    young man with some community support. That he has that support will no doubt
    be considered by the Parole Board. <span class=GramE>As will the fact that he
    pled guilty, accepting full responsibility for the offences.</span> Should he
    bring the determination he had in pursuing the terrorist activities and
    objectives to his rehabilitation, he has the capacity to be rehabilitated. That
    too should be a positive factor. Zakaria Amara asked me not to close the door.
    While I have concluded that the only fit sentence is one of life imprisonment,
    I do not regard the door as permanently closed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant essentially raises one issue on appeal.  He submits that in imposing a life sentence,
    the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient, or indeed any weight, to his
    many positive features and the mitigating factors in his case. According to the
    appellant, had the sentencing judge given those factors the weight they deserved,
    he would have received a sentence in the range of 18 to 20 years for his
    participation in the bomb plot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, we see no merit in this argument, which
    in essence is that life sentences should be reserved for the worst cases
    involving the worst circumstances and the worst offenders. That notion was laid
    to rest by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R.
    v. L.M.</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at paras. 18-22, a decision with which the
    sentencing judge was fully familiar. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, having regard to all the facts and
    circumstances, the sentencing judge concluded that the appellant’s case was one
    of those rare instances where a life sentence was warranted. That disposition
    was open to him and we see no basis for interfering with it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, had the sentencing judge followed the
    approach to the sentencing of terrorists that we have outlined in <i>R. v. Khawaja</i> and <i>R. v. Khalid</i>, released concurrently, the result would have been the
    same. As we observed in those decisions, life sentences should not be viewed as
    exceptional for terrorists who actively participate in plots that, to their
    knowledge, are designed to or are likely to result in the indiscriminate
    killing of innocent human beings. Under that approach, a life sentence for the
    appellant would have been a certainty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the mastermind of a plot that, at the
    very least, he knew was likely to result in the indiscriminate killing of
    innocent people on a potentially massive scale.  Indeed, in the appellant’s case, a strong
    argument can be made that widespread carnage was precisely the outcome that he
    intended.  As the sentencing judge
    observed at para. 102: “[T]here is no dispute that what would have occurred was
    multiple death[s] and injuries.... [T]he potential for loss of life existed on
    a scale never before seen in Canada.” Add to this observation, the sentencing
    judge’s finding that the appellant’s reformation is far from certain and that
    his prospects for rehabilitation “are guarded at this stage”, and a life
    sentence becomes the only feasible sentence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal from sentence is dismissed.</p>
