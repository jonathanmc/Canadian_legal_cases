  <h2>By the Court:</h2>
  <h2>I.          Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Piratheepan Nadarajah is wanted in the United
    States to stand trial on terrorism charges for his alleged role in assisting
    the Liberation Tigers of the Tamil Eelam (the “LTTE”).  It is alleged that in August 2006, Nadarajah,
    together with three others, attempted to purchase surface-to-air-missiles and
    AK-47s on behalf of the LTTE from an undercover law enforcement officer who was
    posing as a black market arms dealer in Long Island, New York.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 20, 2006, the Minister of Justice
    issued an Authority to Proceed under s. 15 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18 (the “Act”) to seek a committal
    order against Nadarajah.  The Authority
    to Proceed identified the following Canadian criminal offences as corresponding
    to the alleged criminal conduct for which Nadarajah’s committal into custody
    for extradition to the United States is sought: (1) participating in the
    activity of a terrorist group, contrary to s. 83.18 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46; (2) conspiracy to traffic in
    weapons, contrary to ss. 465(3) and 99(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>; and (3) attempt to traffic in weapons, contrary to
    s. 99(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By order of Pattillo J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice dated March 5, 2008, Nadarajah was committed into custody for
    extradition.  On November 17, 2009, the
    Minister of Justice ordered his surrender to the United States.  Nadarajah appeals against the committal order
    and also applies for judicial review of the Minister’s surrender order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nadarajah’s extradition hearing was held
    together with that of Suresh Sriskandarajah, who is also wanted in the United
    States to stand trial for unrelated alleged terrorism offences in respect of
    the LTTE.  The proceedings against
    Sriskandarajah also led to a committal order by the extradition judge and,
    eventually, a surrender order by the Minister.  Like Nadarajah, Sriskandarajah appealed from his committal order and
    sought judicial review of the Minister’s surrender decision.  This court heard his appeal and judicial
    review application together with those of Nadarajah.  Our reasons for decision in Sriskandarajah’s
    proceedings are being released concurrently with these reasons.</p>
  <h2>II.        Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At their extradition hearings, Nadarajah and
    Sriskandarajah raised several <i>Charter</i> arguments.  They argued that the
    statutory definition of “terrorist activity” found in s. 83.01(1)(b), and its
    operation throughout the terrorism provisions in Part II.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, violated their right to
    freedom of expression (s. 2(b)) and freedom of association (s. 2(d)).  They also argued that the offence-creating
    provisions in Part II.1 and, in particular, s. 83.18, were unconstitutionally
    vague and overbroad and, therefore, violated their rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  On appeal, they have narrowed their <i>Charter</i> arguments.  They no longer contend that s. 83.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) violates s. 2(d), and they no longer argue that the
    offence-creating provisions are unconstitutionally vague.  They do, however, maintain their arguments
    based on s. 2(b) and overbreadth.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to the constitutional arguments,
    Nadarajah raises two additional grounds of appeal, one relating to the
    committal order and the other by way of judicial review attacking the
    Minister’s surrender decision. Nadarajah submits that the extradition judge
    erred by ruling that the test for committal set out in s. 29(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the Act was satisfied.  On the judicial review application, he
    submits that the Minister’s surrender decision is tainted by procedural
    unfairness and that the decision to surrender is an unreasonable one.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We reject these arguments.  For the following reasons, we conclude that
    Nadarajah’s appeal and judicial review application must be dismissed.</p>
  <h2>III.       Discussion</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Constitutional Arguments</h2>
  <h2>(a)  The s. 2(b) Arguments</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We have addressed the s. 2(b) arguments raised
    on this appeal and that of Sriskandarajah in our reasons in <i>R. v. Khawaja</i>, released
    concurrently.  For those reasons, we
    would not give effect to the submission that the motive clause in s. 83.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b)(i)(A) contravenes s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <h2>(b)  The s. 7 Challenge</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By order of the extradition judge, Nadarajah was
    committed for surrender to the United States on the offences set out in the
    Minister’s Authority to Proceed issued under s. 15 of the Act.  As indicated above, those offences included
    participating in the activity of a terrorist group, contrary to s. 83.18.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If, as counsel for Nadarajah submits, s. 83.18
    is unconstitutionally overbroad, the provision is of no force and effect and
    the extradition judge’s committal order cannot stand.  Without the committal order, the surrender
    order would fall.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Nadarajah, in her helpful
    submissions, contends that the wide meaning given to the words “participating”
    and “contributing” in s. 83.18, combined with the very broad definition of
    “terrorist activity” in s. 83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b), which reaches
    inchoate conduct such as conspiracies and attempts, results in the potential
    imposition of criminal liability for conduct that is very far removed from any
    substantive offence.  Counsel argues that
    a provision that imposes criminal liability for conduct that has not reached
    the point at which liability could attach for an inchoate crime, such as
    conspiracy or attempt, necessarily overshoots any legitimate legislative
    purpose and is therefore unconstitutionally overbroad.  She supports this submission by reference to
    cases that have refused to impose criminal liability for double-barrelled inchoate
    offences such as attempting to conspire:  see <i>R. v. D</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>ry</i>,
    [2006] 2 S.C.R. 669, at paras. 47-50.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The extradition judge rejected this submission
    at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When the words of the impugned provisions are read
    in their entire context, I do not think that the means chosen by Parliament are
    too sweeping having regard to the objective of the legislation which is the
    prosecution and prevention of terrorist offences. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An understanding of the overbreadth argument
    requires an appreciation of the interaction of s. 83.18 and parts of the
    definition provisions found in s. 83.01.  None of the legislation makes for easy reading.  Section 83.18 and the relevant parts of the
    definitions are set out below:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>83.18</b> (1)
    Every one who knowingly participates in or contributes to, directly or
    indirectly, any activity of a terrorist group for the purpose of enhancing the
    ability of any terrorist group to facilitate or carry out a terrorist activity
    is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not
    exceeding ten years.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2) An offence may be committed under subsection (1)
    whether or not</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a) <span class=GramE>a</span> terrorist group actually facilitates or carries out a terrorist activity;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) <span class=GramE>the</span> participation or contribution of the accused actually enhances the ability of a

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) <span class=GramE>the</span> accused knows the specific nature of any terrorist activity that may be
    facilitated or carried out by a terrorist group.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3)  Participating in or contributing to an activity of a terrorist group
    includes</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a) <span class=GramE>providing</span>,
    receiving or recruiting a person to receive training;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) <span class=GramE>providing</span> or offering to provide a skill or an expertise for the benefit of, at the

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) <span class=GramE>recruiting</span> a person in order to facilitate or commit</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i) <span class=GramE>a</span> terrorism offence, or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii) <span class=GramE>an</span> act or omission outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would be a
    terrorism offence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d) <span class=GramE>entering</span> or remaining in any country for the benefit of, at the direction of or in

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii) <span class=GramE>an</span> act or omission outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would be a
    terrorism offence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4)  In
    determining whether an accused participates in or contributes to any activity
    of a terrorist group, the court may consider, among other factors, whether the
    accused</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a) <span class=GramE>uses</span> a name, word, symbol or other representation that identifies, or is associated
    with, the terrorist group;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) <span class=GramE>frequently</span> associates with any of the persons who constitute the terrorist group;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) <span class=GramE>receives</span> any benefit from the terrorist group; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d) <span class=GramE>repeatedly</span> engages in activities at the instruction of any of the persons who constitute

    directly or indirectly participating in or contributing to the activities of a
    terrorist group.  Section 83.18(3)
    provides a non-exhaustive list of the activities that can constitute
    “participating” or “contributing”.  We do
    not think that s. 83.18(3) expands the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of the offence.  All the conduct described in s. 83.18(3)
    falls within the normal meaning of the words “participates” and
    “contributes”.  </p>

    relation to an accused’s conduct that can constitute evidence of participating
    in or contributing to the activity of a terrorist group.  Section 83.18(4) does not expand the meaning
    of participation or contribution.  It
    simply allows the court to “consider” the factors identified in the subsection.
    The extent to which these factors assist in proving participation or
    contribution will depend on the circumstances.  Section 83.18(4) does not add anything to the generally applicable rules
    of evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To understand the phrase, “any activity of a
    terrorist group”, in s. 83.18 requires reference to three of the definitions
    found in s. 83.01 and set out above.  A
    terrorist group includes an entity that has as one of its purposes or
    activities the facilitation or carrying out of terrorist activity, itself a
    defined term.  All activities of a
    terrorist group are not, however, necessarily terrorist activities within the
    meaning of the definition of that phrase.  The word “entity” is broadly defined and even includes a single
    person.  Thus, an activity of a terrorist
    group in s. 83.18 can include a non-terrorist activity engaged in by an entity
    that falls within the definition of a terrorist group.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The combined effect of the definitions set out
    above significantly expands the <i>actus <span
class=GramE>reus</span></i> of the offence created by s. 83.18.  This is particularly so given that the
    definition of terrorist activity includes a conspiracy, attempt, threat to
    commit, counselling or being an accessory after the fact to any of the acts or
    omissions caught by the definition of terrorist activity. Thus, the activity of
    a terrorist group may include a failed and futile attempt to do something that
    would have constituted terrorist activity under the definition. An individual
    who did anything that directly or indirectly contributed to that failed and
    futile attempt would have committed the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of the offence described in s. 83.18.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The ambit of the crime created by s. 83.18 is
    not defined exclusively by its <i>actus <span
class=GramE>reus</span></i>.  The <i>mens rea</i> must also be considered.  The <i>mens
    rea</i> is twofold.  First, the act said
    to constitute participation in or contribution to any activity of a terrorist
    group must be done “knowingly”. The term “knowingly” establishes a high level of <i>mens rea</i>.  To act “knowingly”, a person who does the act
    said to amount to participating in or contributing to any activity of a
    terrorist group must know the circumstances that render the entity in question
    a “terrorist group”.  The person must
    also know that the thing being participated in or contributed to is “an
    activity” of that terrorist group.  Thus,
    if the entity is said to be a terrorist group because it has engaged in
    terrorist activity as defined in s. 83.01, a person must know the nature of the
    activity engaged in by the entity he or she is participating in or contributing
    to before that person’s actions can attract liability under s. 83.18. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to the requirement that the acts of
    participation or contribution must be done knowingly, the reach of s. 83.18 is
    further restricted by the requirement that the Crown prove an ulterior
    intention. The acts that amount to participation in or contribution to the
    activity of a terrorist group must be done for the specific purpose “of
    enhancing the ability of any terrorist group to facilitate or carry out a terrorist
    activity”.  Even if the acts of participation
    or contribution are done knowingly, they are not captured by s. 83.18 unless they
    are done with the further and specific intent of improving the ability of a
    terrorist group to facilitate or carry out a terrorist activity.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We think it is significant that the ulterior
    intention requirement speaks of terrorist activity and not the activity of a
    terrorist group.  Not all activities of a
    terrorist group are terrorist activities as defined in s. 83.01. The ulterior
    intention requirement is met only if the individual’s expressed purpose is to
    enhance the group’s ability to carry out acts that are within the definition of
    terrorist activity. An accused, of course, need not know the definition of
    terrorist activity in s. 83.01.  The
    accused must, however, have knowledge of the facts that bring the activity to
    be facilitated or carried out within that definition.</p>

    specific <i>mens rea</i> requirement.  Sections 83.18(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    and (b) declare that liability will attach even if the prohibited purpose is
    not achieved.  The same result would
    follow if s. 83.18(2) were not in the section.  Where a crime is defined to include an ulterior purpose, the Crown is
    not required to prove that the purpose was actually achieved.  That is why the intention is described as an
    “ulterior” intention.  </p>

    directs that the accused need not know “the specific nature of any terrorist
    activity that may be facilitated or carried out”.  Once again, there is nothing unusual about
    this provision. Even without subsection (2<span class=GramE>)(</span>c), on the
    application of generally applicable criminal law principles, knowledge that the
    activity was of a kind that came within the definition of the phrase “terrorist
    activity” would satisfy the <i>mens rea</i> requirement without proof of specific knowledge of the exact nature of the
    terrorist activity:  see <i>D.P.P. for Northern Ireland v. Maxwell</i>,

  <h2>(ii)  The Objective of s. 83.18</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 83.18 is part of the anti-terrorism
    legislation that was introduced in October of 2001.  As explained in <i>Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re)</i>, [2004] 2
    S.C.R. 248, at para. 40, that legislative package was intended to further the
    prevention of terrorism and the prosecution of terrorism-related offences.  In <i>Ahmad</i>,
    at paras. 50-61, Dawson J. examined at some length the relevant legislative
    history, extrinsic material such as Hansard, and the international context in
    which the anti-terrorism provisions, including Part II.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, were proclaimed in 2001.  We will not repeat the several references
    cited by Dawson J. to the testimony of the Minister of Justice and other senior
    federal civil servants explaining the purpose of the legislation and the
    importance placed on preventative measures by those who fashioned the
    legislation.  We adopt Dawson J.’s
    conclusions at paras. 60-61 with respect to the objective of the legislation,
    including the objective of s. 83.18:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The legislative history just reviewed demonstrates
    the importance of the preventive objective of the legislation.  That objective reflects the difficulty of
    deterring and prosecuting those involved in terrorist activity by relying on
    traditional criminal law approaches.  <i>It is an objective that supports
    Parliament’s determination that there is substantive harm inherent in all
    aspects of preparation for a terrorist act because of the great harm that flows
    from the completion of terrorist acts.</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is this preventive objective that explains why
    Parliament took such an expansive approach to defining the scope of
    liability.... [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h2>(iii)  Is the Scope of s. 83.18 <span
class=GramE>Grossly</span> Disproportionate to the Legislative Objective?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant describes s. 83.18 as
    imposing criminal liability for inchoate conduct that occurs at some point on
    the continuum of conduct that ultimately culminates in a substantive
    offence.  She submits that the conduct
    criminalized by s. 83.18 may fall at a place on the continuum that is even
    before the point where the crimes of conspiracy and attempt are committed. She
    argues that s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, and
    in particular the overbreadth doctrine, prohibits the imposition of criminal
    liability at a point on the conduct continuum that is this far removed from the
    commission of any substantive offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no doubt that the offences proscribed
    by s. 83.18 may well be preliminary to much more serious and deadly
    conduct.  However, we think counsel’s
    description of   s. 83.18 as creating inchoate
    liability is a mischaracterization.  Section 83.18 creates a substantive offence.  It requires proof of conduct, participation
    in or contribution to the activity of a terrorist group that goes beyond
    inchoate liability, such as conspiracy or counselling.  Nor is liability imposed for anything short
    of the completion of the <i>actus <span
class=GramE>reus</span></i> with the requisite <i>mens rea</i>.  Section 83.18 is
    by any measure a substantive offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no constitutional principle that
    declares that acts that are preparatory to some other crime cannot in and of
    themselves be defined as a substantive crime:  <i>R. v. Murdoch</i> (2003), 176
    C.C.C. (3d) 232 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 38. There is no single bright line along
    the continuum of conduct between that which can constitutionally be declared
    criminal and that which cannot. If Parliament chooses to criminalize conduct
    that is preliminary to some further criminal conduct, overbreadth and vagueness
    may become concerns. Parliament’s power to constitutionally criminalize
    preparatory acts as substantive offences is confined by the principles of
    overbreadth and vagueness.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We have no difficulty concluding that when the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> and <i>mens rea</i> are properly described, s.
    83.18 prohibits actions that clearly pose a significant danger to the
    community. This is particularly so when one bears in mind that s. 83.18 does not
    criminalize mere participation in or contribution to activities of a terrorist
    group, but criminalizes only that participation or contribution which is done
    for the specific purpose of improving the terrorist group’s ability to facilitate
    or carry out terrorist activity as defined in s. 83.01. Conduct that falls
    within the prohibition of s. 83.18 is both inherently dangerous and potentially
    preparatory to other very dangerous acts.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As discussed by Dawson J. in <i>Ahmad</i>, at paras. 54-61, prior to passage
    of the anti-terrorism legislation, Parliament had ample evidence before it
    indicating that sophisticated terrorist operations depended on the existence
    and functioning of discrete units, each of which engaged in various acts
    intended to facilitate and culminate in the kind of mass murder that has become
    all too commonplace.  In light of the
    nature of sophisticated terrorist operations and the huge price to be paid if
    terrorist plots reach <span class=GramE>fruition,</span> it was reasonably open
    to Parliament to treat conduct that is preparatory to and in furtherance of the
    ultimate goal of terrorist groups as sufficiently harmful and dangerous to the
    community to warrant its criminalization as a substantive offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The scope of s. 83.18 is entirely consistent
    with the preventative thrust of the anti-terrorism legislation. The appellant
    has failed to demonstrate that the criminal prohibition in s. 83.18 imposes
    limits on individual liberty that go beyond those needed to achieve the purpose
    of the legislation.  The s. 7 claim in this
    appeal and in <i>Sriskandarajah</i> fails.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on the contents of the original and
    supplemental records of the case, the extradition judge concluded that there
    was evidence before him which, if accepted by a properly instructed jury, would
    establish that: (1) the LTTE is a terrorist group; (2) in or around July and
    August 2006, Nadarajah and his alleged co-conspirators participated in or
    contributed to the activity of the LTTE by attempting to purchase
    surface-to-air missiles and AK-47s in the United States for use by the LTTE;
    (3) Nadarajah knew of the existence of the LTTE and his participation in the
    attempted purchase was intended by him to enhance the ability of the LTTE to
    carry out a terrorist activity.  The
    extradition judge further held that there was some evidence in respect of each
    of the essential elements of the weapons-related offences alleged against
    Nadarajah.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, as Nadarajah had conceded that he
    was the person named in the request for extradition by the United States, the
    extradition judge concluded that the test for committal was satisfied.  He therefore granted the requested committal
    order in respect of the three Canadian offences listed in the Authority to
    Proceed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The extradition judge, as he was required to do,
    assessed all the evidence of Nadarajah’s alleged conduct as outlined in the
    records of the case, to determine whether it supported the existence of each
    element of the Canadian criminal offences alleged.  In so doing, the extradition judge properly
    identified the constituent elements of the offences alleged and assessed the
    evidence in light of those elements.  In
    our view, the evidence, including the evidence described in paragraphs 39 and 40
    of these reasons, amply supported the extradition judge’s conclusion that the
    test for committal was satisfied in respect of each of the essential elements
    of the Canadian offences alleged against Nadarajah.  </p>

  <h2>(3)       Attack on Surrender Decision</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nadarajah’s attack on the Minister’s surrender
    decision is also unsustainable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nadarajah contends that the Minister’s refusal
    to provide him with a copy of the assessment of the feasibility of prosecution
    in Canada conducted by the Canadian prosecuting authorities pursuant to <i>United States of America v. Cotroni</i>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469, denied him procedural fairness.  He asserts further that this court’s
    treatment of <i>Cotroni</i> assessments is
    “unduly restrictive”.  Finally, he argues
    that the Minister’s determination that extradition does not unjustifiably
    infringe his s. 6 <i>Charter</i> rights was
    unreasonable.  We would not give effect
    to these arguments.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Procedural fairness and fundamental justice at
    the surrender stage of the extradition process require that: (1) the person whose
    extradition is sought know the case against him or her; (2) the Minister
    provide the person sought with a reasonable opportunity to adequately state his
    or her case against surrender; (3) the Minister give due consideration to all
    relevant factors in deciding whether to order surrender; and (4) the Minister
    give sufficient reasons for the decision to surrender: <i>Whitley v. United States of America</i> (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 794
    (C.A.), affirmed [1996] 1 S.C.R. 467; <i>United
    States of America v. Lake</i> (2006), 212 C.C.C. (3d) 51 (Ont. C.A.), affirmed
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These requirements were met in this case.  In particular, with respect to the Minister’s
    refusal to provide Nadarajah with a copy of the <i>Cotroni</i> assessment conducted by Canadian prosecuting authorities,
    the Minister’s reasons for surrender reveal that: (1) Nadarajah was provided
    with all non-privileged materials that the Minister considered in making his
    surrender decision; (2) the Minister had not been provided with a copy of the
    requested <i>Cotroni</i> assessment; (3)
    Nadarajah, like the Minister himself, was furnished with the document
    containing the conclusion of the Canadian prosecuting authorities that
    prosecution in Canada would not be “equally effective” to a prosecution in the
    United States; and (4) the Minister conducted his own independent <i>Cotroni</i> inquiry, bearing in mind all the
    materials before him (including Nadarajah’s submissions), the results of which
    are set out in the Minister’s reasons.  In all these circumstances, the Minister’s refusal to provide Nadarajah
    with a copy of the requested <i>Cotroni</i> assessment was not unreasonable and the Minister’s limited disclosure
    obligations were satisfied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor do we accept Nadarajah’s complaint that the
    Minister failed to properly assess and give appropriate weight to all relevant
    factors in deciding whether to order surrender.  In his reasons, having considered the applicable <i>Cotroni</i> factors, the Minister stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    important principle of international law that a state should extradite unless
    it can prosecute the offence itself must be considered in determining whether
    extradition would violate Mr. Nadarajah's section 6(1) <i>Charter</i> rights.  In the circumstances of this
    case, insofar as the investigation was initiated and developed by the American
    authorities, all of the co-accused have been charged there, and most of the
    witnesses are located there, it would not, in my view, be an unjustifiable
    breach of Mr. Nadarajah's section 6 <i>Charter</i> rights to surrender him to
    face prosecution in the United States.  Nor am I persuaded that this is a case where surrender would be either
    unjust or oppressive under paragraph 44(1<span class=GramE>)(</span><i>a</i>) of the Act or would otherwise warrant
    a refusal of surrender under the Treaty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This decision, which reflects a balancing by the
    Minister of the relevant competing considerations regarding surrender, was open
    to the Minister on the evidence in this case.  It follows that the Minister’s assessment of Nadarajah’s s. 6 <i>Charter</i> right to remain in Canada, in
    the context of s. 44(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) of the Act, fell within a
    range of reasonable outcomes and interference by this court with the Minister’s
    surrender order is precluded.</p>
