  <p class=Party><b>By the Court:</b></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 28, 2009, the respondent, Saad Gaya,
    entered a plea of guilty before Durno J. of the Superior Court of Justice to
    one count in an indictment as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[B]etween the lst day of March 2006 and the 2nd
    day of June 2006, in the City of Mississauga, in the City of Toronto, in the
    Township of Ramara and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, did commit an
    indictable offence to wit, doing anything with intent to cause an explosion
    of an explosive substance that was likely to cause serious bodily harm or
    death to persons or was likely to cause serious damage to property, contrary
    to section 81(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>, for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a
    terrorist group, namely Zakaria Amara and others, thereby committing an
    offence contrary to s. 83.2 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in the case of his co-conspirator, Saad Khalid
    (see our reasons in <i>R. v. Khalid</i>,
    released concurrently), the respondent&#8217;s guilty plea was followed by a <i>Gardiner</i> hearing in which the respondent
    unsuccessfully attempted to reduce his level of moral blameworthiness by
    claiming that he only knew that the bomb or bombs were likely to cause
    substantial damage to property, but that he did not know they would likely
    result in death or serious bodily injury.&nbsp; Based on evidence that the respondent
    knew the intended target was somewhere in Toronto, as well as other facts
    about the plot that were known to the respondent, the sentencing judge was
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent was wilfully blind as
    to whether the explosions would likely cause death or serious bodily
    harm.&nbsp; As we noted in <i>Khalid</i>, at para. 3, wilful blindness
    is the same as knowledge in the eyes of the criminal law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 18, 2010, the respondent was sentenced to
    4 &frac12; years imprisonment. In arriving at that sentence, the sentencing
    judge credited the respondent with 7 &frac12; years for the 43 &frac12;
    months he had spent in pre-sentence custody. Hence, the respondent received
    the equivalent of a 12-year sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to parole, the sentencing judge declined
    to make an order under s.&nbsp;743.6(1.2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, requiring that the
    respondent serve one half of his sentence before being eligible for parole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown applies for leave to appeal and if leave is
    granted, seeks to have the respondent&#8217;s sentence increased to an
    effective sentence of 17 or 18 years&#8217; imprisonment. The Crown also
    seeks an order under s. 743.6(1.2) of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> requiring that the respondent serve one half of his sentence before
    being eligible for full parole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, we would grant leave to
    appeal and increase the respondent&#8217;s effective sentence from 12 to 18
    years.&nbsp; Taking into account the 7
    &frac12; years credited for pre-sentence custody, we would increase the sentence
    from 4 <span class=GramE>&frac12;&nbsp; years</span> to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 &frac12; years. We would also make an order under s. 743.6(1.2) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> requiring that
    the respondent serve one half of his sentence (5 years and 3 months) before
    he may be released on full parole. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Offence
    and the Respondent&#8217;s Role in it</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[7]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was a willing and active participant in a plot
    formulated by Zakaria Amara to blow up the Toronto Stock Exchange Tower, the
    CSIS Headquarters on Front Street in Toronto, and an unspecified military
    base east of Toronto.&nbsp; Based on
    the sentencing judge&#8217;s findings, the respondent did not know the
    precise buildings that Amara was targeting, nor did he know that he was to
    drive a truck containing a bomb to one of the targeted locations. However, in
    accordance with the sentencing judge&#8217;s findings on the <i>Gardiner</i> hearing, the respondent knew
    that he was engaged in a plot which, if successful, would likely result in
    death and serious injury. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[8]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The details of the bomb plot and the horrific consequences that would
    have resulted had it succeeded have been described in our reasons in<i> Khalid</i> and in <i>R. v. Amara </i>(also released concurrently), and need not be
    repeated.&nbsp; The pertinent facts for
    the purpose of this appeal are that the respondent joined the conspiracy on
    March 22, <span class=GramE>2006,</span> three weeks after Khalid had become
    involved in it.&nbsp; Like Khalid, the
    respondent was recruited by Amara. He and Khalid were given the
    responsibility of renting space for storing the ammonium nitrate that Amara needed
    to make the bombs. After the ammonium nitrate was purchased &#8211; through
    the involvement of a police agent &#8211; the respondent and Khalid were
    given the task of storing it at the rented premises. On June 2, 2006, he and
    Khalid were arrested together while in the process of off-loading 3 tons of
    ammonium nitrate into an industrial unit in Newmarket that Khalid had rented. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[9]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the time of his arrest, the respondent had over $9,000 in cash in
    his knapsack. Also found in his knapsack was a memory stick containing a
    lengthy audio message saved on May 12, 2006 from Amara to him and
    Khalid.&nbsp; Amara in his message gave
    the respondent the responsibility of obtaining a chemical compound and some
    laboratory equipment needed to manufacture the bombs. The message also gave
    instructions to Khalid to do reconnaissance of potential targets in downtown
    Toronto.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
  class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;  '>[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; In addition, Amara indicated in the
    message that he agreed with the respondent and Khalid&#8217;s suggestion to
    move the bombing date forward. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[10]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based on the totality of the evidence, including a statement that the
    respondent gave to the police following his arrest, the sentencing judge
    determined at para. 121 that his &#8220;degree of responsibility remains
    relatively high, albeit not as high as others in the plot.&#8221;&nbsp; In discussing the aggravating factors
    in the respondent&#8217;s case, the sentencing judge commented at paras.
    48-49:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    offender knew that they were considering targeting locations in Toronto on
    his own admission to police and on what I found he heard Amara tell Khalid
    about doing surveillance in downtown Toronto. Any bombs in Toronto would
    likely have drastic results.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>He
    knew he was contributing to a bomb plot and that they were getting two tons
    of ingredients. While he did not know all the details because the leaders did
    not tell him, that plan if implemented would have enormous ramifications for
    those close to the bomb, for the community at large and the country. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[11]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge also observed at para. 46 that the
    respondent&#8217;s involvement in the plot was &#8220;not a spur of the
    moment knee jerk reaction&#8221;. His first involvement was on March 22,
    2006, a little more than two months prior to his arrest. According to the
    sentencing judge, the respondent &#8220;was part of those plotting to place a
    bomb or bombs to protest Canada&#8217;s involvement [in Afghanistan] for at least
    a month.&#8221;</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Offender</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[12]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge noted that, although the respondent was 21 years
    of age at the time of the hearing, he was an 18-year old first offender at
    the time of the offence and the youngest person charged in the bomb plot. He
    accepted the joint findings of forensic psychiatrists retained by the
    respondent, Dr. Ramshaw and Dr. Cohen, that the respondent was na&iuml;ve and
    immature when he joined up with Amara.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the sentencing judge found the respondent to be &#8220;an
    intelligent young man, not one with learning deficits&#8221; (para.
    121).&nbsp; As the respondent had
    acknowledged to police, he was certainly &#8220;able to put two and two
    together.&#8221; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[13]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge also took into consideration that the respondent
    had entered a plea of guilty and that he was the only one of his co-accused
    to have given a statement to the police following his arrest. In his
    statement, the respondent had provided the police with some information
    &#8220;they did not have before&#8221;.&nbsp; However, according to the sentencing judge at para. 61, &#8220;he was
    clear he did not want to point fingers, was inconsistent at times, and
    obviously hesitant to go too far&#8221;.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[14]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge also referred to the joint psychiatric opinion
    that the respondent did not suffer from any major mental illness or
    psychiatric disorder.&nbsp; The
    respondent&#8217;s avowed reason for participating in the plot was to
    pressure Canada into withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.&nbsp; He had told Dr. Ramshaw that &#8220;he
    knew what he was doing was wrong but the prevention of death and suffering in
    Afghanistan was much more important than the destruction of
    property.&#8221;&nbsp; In his statement
    to the police, the respondent said that Amara had told him &#8220;that maybe
    he was that one person God [had] chosen who was going to make a
    difference&#8221; and that &#8220;he [the respondent] would be a hero in the
    eyes of God.&#8221;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[15]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge further noted at para. 71 that the respondent had
    good family support and support from a wide range of friends and community
    members.&nbsp; Based on information
    from various sources, including the respondent himself, the sentencing judge
    concluded at para. 68 that the respondent was &#8220;genuinely
    remorseful&#8221; for his actions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[16]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge, at para. 73, was also satisfied that the
    respondent had taken some steps towards rehabilitation and that he did not
    present a &#8220;significant risk to himself or others in the short-term
    period.&#8221;&nbsp; However, he noted
    Dr. Ramshaw&#8217;s concern that, in view of the respondent&#8217;s past behavior,
    &#8220;risk over the long-term period cannot be ruled out&#8221; and that
    &#8220;counselling, including cognitive behavioural therapy&#8221;, should be
    undertaken.</span></p>
  
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Sentence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[17]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After reviewing in considerable detail the circumstances surrounding
    the offence, the background and character of the offender, the aggravating
    and mitigating factors, the governing principles of sentencing and the
    various sentences imposed in other cases involving terrorism, the sentencing
    judge determined that a fit sentence was one of 12 years&#8217; <span
  class=GramE>imprisonment</span>. That was two years less than the sentence he
    imposed on Khalid. Although the sentencing judge did not specifically address
    the rationale for the two-year differential, he noted at para. 124 that
    Khalid&#8217;s involvement in the offence &#8220;was more significant than
    [the respondent], he was involved longer, did more and was involved in
    recruiting another person.&nbsp;&nbsp; He [Khalid], however, was the first to plead guilty.&#8221; </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[18]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We see little distinction between the culpability of Khalid and the
    respondent. However, we accept that it was open to the sentencing judge to
    make a distinction between the two offenders and to sentence the respondent
    to a shorter sentence. We would not interfere on that basis.&nbsp; In raising the respondent&#8217;s
    sentence, we have respected the distinction drawn by the sentencing judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
  lang=EN-US>[19]<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Our reasons for increasing the respondent&#8217;s effective sentence
    from 12 to 18 years are essentially the same as those that have led us to
    increase Khalid&#8217;s sentence from 14 to 20&nbsp;years. In short, we are
    respectfully of the view that the sentence imposed on the respondent did not
    adequately reflect the unique nature of terrorism-related crimes, nor did it
    adequately reflect the enormity of the respondent&#8217;s crime and the role
    he played in it. Like Khalid, the respondent played an essential role in a
    scheme which, if implemented, could have killed countless people and left the
    entire country changed very much for the worse. </span></p>

    over-emphasized the significance of the mitigating factors relating to the
    respondent and reduced the sentence below the appropriate range. Taking into
    account all the mitigating factors applicable to the respondent, a sentence
    of 20 to 25 years would not have been out of line. &nbsp;However, given the distinction that the
    sentencing judge drew between Khalid and the respondent, and given our
    conclusion that Khalid&#8217;s sentence should be increased by 6 years, we would
    only increase the respondent&#8217;s sentence by the same amount.</span></p>

    pre-sentence custody, we would increase his sentence from 4 &frac12; years to
    10 &frac12; years.&nbsp; </span></p>

    prospects.&nbsp; In our view, had the

    come to a different conclusion on the issue of parole ineligibility.</span></p>

    sentencing judge found that the respondent heard <span class=SpellE>Amara&#8217;s</span> message to Khalid about doing surveillance in downtown Toronto.&nbsp; In responding to the Crown&#8217;s
    sentence appeal, the respondent challenged this finding.&nbsp; In our view, this was a finding that the
    sentencing judge was entitled to make, particularly given that the memory stick
    containing the message was found in the respondent&#8217;s possession and given
    the absence of any conflicting evidence from the respondent.</p>
