  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 4, 2009, the respondent, Saad Khalid, entered a
    plea of guilty before Durno J. of the Superior Court of Justice to one count in
    an indictment as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[B]etween the 1st day of March 2006 and the 2nd day
    of June 2006, in the City of Mississauga, in the City of Toronto, in the
    Township of Ramara and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, did commit an
    indictable offence to wit, doing anything with intent to cause an explosion of
    an explosive substance that was likely to cause serious bodily harm or death to
    persons or was likely to cause serious damage to property, contrary to section
    81(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, for
    the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group,
    namely Zakaria Amara and others, thereby committing an offence contrary to section
    83.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Section 83.2 provides for a maximum punishment of life
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In pleading guilty to this offence, the respondent was
    prepared to admit that he participated in a bomb plot with a terrorist group
    led by Zakaria Amara (“Amara”), but he would not admit to knowing that
    detonation of the bomb or bombs would likely result in death or serious bodily
    harm. He was only willing to admit that, to his knowledge, the explosions would
    likely result in serious property damage. The sentencing judge therefore heard
    evidence as to the respondent’s state of mind and his degree of moral
    blameworthiness, pursuant to <i>R. v.
    Gardiner</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368 (the “<i>Gardiner</i> hearing”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge rejected the respondent’s attempt
    to reduce his level of moral culpability. In a lengthy ruling dated August 20,
    2009, reported at 2009 CanLII 44274, the sentencing judge stated at para. 128 that
    he was “satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that [the respondent] was wilfully
    blind as to whether persons were likely to be killed or seriously injured as a
    result of the explosion(s) he was assisting with.”  Wilful blindness is the same as knowledge in
    the eyes of the criminal law. In other words, the respondent knew that the terrorist
    activities in which he was an active and willing participant were likely to cause
    death or serious bodily injury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having determined the respondent’s level of
    culpability, the next issue was the appropriate sentence. Over the course of
    the sentencing hearing, the sentencing judge heard from several witnesses who
    attested to the respondent’s good character. In addition, numerous letters of
    reference were filed on his behalf. The sentencing judge also received a report
    and heard evidence about the respondent from Dr. Ramshaw, a forensic
    psychiatrist retained by the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown sought a sentence of 18 to 20 years and an
    order requiring the respondent to serve half of the sentence before being
    eligible for release on full parole. With respect to the amount of credit to be
    given for the 39 months spent by the respondent in pre-sentence custody, Crown
    counsel submitted that he should be credited with 5 to 5 1/2 years.  Defence counsel sought a sentence of 8 to 10 years,
    with no increased period of parole ineligibility, less a credit of 8 years and 3
    months for pre-sentence custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 3, 2009, the sentencing judge delivered
    very full and comprehensive reasons for sentence.  In the end, having regard to all the
    circumstances and the relevant sentencing principles, he concluded that a
    sentence of 14 years was appropriate. To accomplish this, he sentenced the
    respondent to “a further seven years, in addition to 39 months of pre-sentence
    custody” for which he credited the respondent with 7 years. The sentencing
    judge declined to make an order under s. 743.6(1.2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requiring that the respondent serve one half of his
    sentence before being eligible for parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown applies for leave to appeal and if leave is
    granted, seeks to have the respondent’s sentence increased to an effective
    sentence of 18 to 20 years. The Crown does not challenge the credit of 7 years
    allotted for the 39 months the respondent spent in pre-sentence custody.  Hence, in real numbers, the Crown submits that
    we should add 4 to 6 years onto the respondent’s 7-year sentence. The Crown
    also seeks an order under s.&nbsp;743.6(1.2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, requiring that the respondent serve half of his
    sentence before being eligible for full parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, we would grant leave to
    appeal, allow the appeal and increase the respondent’s effective sentence from 14
    to 20 years. Taking into account the 7-year credit for pre-sentence custody, that
    translates into a sentence of 13 years. We would also make an order under s.
    743.6(1.2), requiring that the respondent serve one half of his sentence (6 1/2
    years) before he may be released on full parole.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Over
    a period of three months, from March 1, 2006 until the day of his arrest on
    June 2, 2006, the respondent participated in a plot with his high school friend
    Amara and others, to detonate bombs at the Toronto Stock Exchange Tower, the
    CSIS Headquarters on Front Street in Toronto, and an unspecified military base east
    of Toronto. These three buildings were to be blown up during the morning rush
    hour. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based
    on the findings of the sentencing judge, the respondent did not know the
    precise locations that Amara was targeting, nor did he know that he was to
    drive a rented van containing a bomb to one of the targeted locations. What he
    did know, pursuant to the sentencing judge’s finding on the <i>Gardiner </i>hearing, was that he was
    engaged in a plot which, if successful, would likely have caused the death or
    serious injury of innocent people. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    bombs that Amara planned to detonate were each to consist of one ton of
    ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel – the blast effect of which would have been
    the equivalent of 768 kilograms of TNT. The consequences resulting from such an
    explosion were not lost on the sentencing judge. As he noted in his ruling on
    the <i>Gardiner</i> hearing at para. 55, it
    “would have caused catastrophic damage to a multi-storey glass and steel frame
    building 35 metres from the bomb site, as well as killing or causing serious
    injuries to people in the path of the blast waves and force.” The sentencing
    judge, who also presided over Amara’s sentencing hearing, described in his
    reasons for sentence in <i>R. v. Amara</i>,
    2010 ONSC 441, at paras. 102 and 104, the horrific consequences that would have
    followed had the plot succeeded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]<span lang=EN-US>here
    is no dispute that what would have occurred was multiple death and injuries. On
    the timetable indicated in the facts with detonation occurring at 9 a.m., the
    impact would have been magnified as workers arrived for work. With one ton
    bombs at each location, the results would have been catastrophic. What this
    case revealed was spine-chilling. I agree with Mr. Lacy that the potential for
    loss of life existed on a scale never before seen in Canada. </span>It was
    almost unthinkable without the suggestion that metal chips would be put in the
    bombs. Had the plan been implemented it would have changed the lives of many,
    if not all Canadians forever. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This was not an offence that would just impact on
    those who were injured or killed and their families and friends. This type of
    offence, even when it is stopped before the plans are implemented, impacts
    throughout Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evidence led by the Crown at the respondent’s
    sentencing hearing, which largely took the form of a “Statement of Uncontested
    Facts”, the respondent’s primary task, up to and including the date of his
    arrest, was to rent an industrial storage unit for storing the three tons of
    ammonium nitrate that Amara had arranged to purchase – unwittingly from a
    police agent – and to off-load and store it there once it was delivered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And that is what the respondent did, with the
    assistance of Saad Gaya, another co-conspirator. The sentencing judge made the
    following findings in this regard:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The offender [the respondent] also gave and relayed
    instructions to Gaya, including telling him on June 1 that he would pick him up
    the next morning but that it would not be from Gaya’s house, and that he was to
    take his beard off and bring $4,000 and food. When arrested, Gaya had over
    $9,000 in his backpack.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On June 2, on instructions from Amara, Saad Khalid
    and Gaya bought a large quantity of corrugated boxes and plastic bags and drove
    to the industrial unit in Newmarket. They assembled the boxes and lined them
    with garbage bags as they were to empty the ammonium nitrate into the boxes and
    stack them. They were then to destroy the ammonium nitrate bags. They were to
    put a dot on the bags so they would know if it was replaced as occurred in the
    London bombings when the authorities switched the bags. In order to put wax on
    the door and the doorframe so that it would be obvious if the door was opened,
    they brought two candles as directed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>After the arrest, police found step-by-step instructions
    to the offender and Gaya outlining what they were to do at the industrial unit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s involvement did not end there.  In concluding that the respondent was not just
    a “gofer”, as he maintained, and that “his degree of responsibility remain[ed]
    relatively high”, the sentencing judge referred to the respondent’s overall
    involvement in the plot as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He is an intelligent young man, not one with
    learning deficits who might not have been able to put together what he got
    himself into. There is no reduction because of the wilful blindness finding
    reference <i>R. v. Sidhu</i> (2009), 242 C.C.C.
    (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 17. He was not just a gofer. No doubt, he bought
    the electrical components, tried to rent one house and did rent two industrial
    units, was prepared to do reconnaissance in downtown Toronto, bought the boxes
    and bags and assembled them, and unloaded the purported ammonium nitrate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He also recruited a third member making sure he
    would not cause any trouble and was a good candidate. He said the candidate
    should be picked on how useful they will be. Getting others involved in the scheme
    is an aggravating factor in itself. He told his accomplices that they had to be
    alert to security measures because Amara was being followed. There was no room
    for error. It was not a joke. They were not cooking biryani. It was not the
    cool club. He wanted them to meet every week to keep everyone updated. While
    that was his wish, it was not going to happen. He also had input into the date
    of the bombings, moving it forward. He gave and relayed instructions to Gaya.
    He was not someone who just sat by waiting for his next assignment without
    providing input.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The electrical components mentioned by the sentencing
    judge were located at the respondent’s home following his arrest. They
    consisted of six light/dark relay switches and a PMK 160 circuit board designed
    to function with a cellular phone and capable of receiving a visual signal
    through a photo-sensor unit. The PMK 160 circuit board could be used at close or
    long range. </p>

    whether persons were likely to be killed or seriously injured as a result of

    and was not “a spur of the moment offence”; the explosion or explosions, to the
    respondent’s knowledge, were likely to cause death or serious bodily harm and
    were intended to cause “serious property damage and a serious risk to the
    health and safety of the public”; and all terrorism offences are serious and the

    guilty plea, his age, his lack of prior criminal record, his remorse, the psychiatric

    recognized that denunciation is “a key component in sentencing for terrorism

    those who might “be tempted to ‘sign-on’ to the terrorist plans of the more

    on his findings, the sentencing judge concluded that the principle of specific
    deterrence had already been achieved in the respondent’s case and there was no
    need to separate the respondent from society because he was not dangerous and
    would not compromise the public’s safety. As for rehabilitation, the sentencing
    judge was of the view “that with counselling [the respondent] can be
    rehabilitated and become a law abiding member of society.” He also believed
    that the respondent had “accepted responsibility for his wrongdoing”, despite
    his attempt to minimize “the results that would likely have flowed from his
    conduct”.  The sentencing judge went on
    to observe that there is a “need to bring home to the [respondent] the enormous
    dangers involved in this activity” and that, while he had “taken some valuable
    steps in that direction… there remains a distance to go.” </span></p>

    the end, having determined that “denunciation and general deterrence are the
    predominant considerations”, but noting that “due consideration must be given
    to all factors relevant to the offence and the offender”, the sentencing judge
    concluded that the respondent should be sentenced to 14 years in the
    penitentiary.  He observed that, but for
    the mitigating factors, the range of 18 to 20 years suggested by the Crown
    “might have been appropriate.” However, in this case, the purposes and
    principles of sentencing could “be achieved with a shorter sentence. The

    the respondent to demonstrate, on balance, and having regard to the

    been specifically deterred and did not present a continuing danger to the

    way not seen in other criminal offences.” He also recognized the enormity of
    the particular crime that the respondent and his confederates were actively
    pursuing. As noted earlier, the sentencing judge observed in <i>Amara</i> at para. 102 that if the bombs had
    been detonated, “the results would have been catastrophic.”  He referred to the case as “spine-chilling”

    reason for taking a more punitive approach to youthful first offenders who might
    be tempted to commit terrorist crimes is to let them know, in clear terms, that
    their youth and lack of criminal antecedents will count for little in
    ameliorating the severity of their sentences. As Lord Phillips C.J. observed in<i> R</i>.<i> v. Barot</i>, [2007] EWCA Crim. 1119, at para. 45, while the length of sentence
    may not deter “the more fanatic” who in some cases, “are prepared to kill
    themselves in order the more readily to kill others”, it is “important that
    those who might be tempted to accept the role of camp followers… are aware

    accept that the respondent’s youth and his lack of criminal antecedents were
    relevant considerations on sentencing. But, in terrorism cases, these factors
    must be viewed through a different lens. Youthful first offenders present as
    attractive recruits to sophisticated terrorists. They are vulnerable and
    impressionable because of their youth and their prior good character makes them
    difficult to detect by law enforcement authorities. The sad truth is that young
    home-grown terrorists with no criminal antecedents have become a reality. And
    that is something the courts must recognize and take into account when deciding
    how much leniency to give to youthful first offenders who commit terrorist
    crimes. </span></p>

    terrorists takes on added significance in situations such as the respondent’s.
    It is easy to get caught up in the fact, without more, that the respondent was
    only 19 years old when he chose to join Amara and his terrorist associates. But
    a more probing inquiry puts the respondent’s youth in a somewhat different
    light.</span></p>

    all accounts, his family is loving and supportive and he was given the
    opportunity of gaining a university education at one of Canada’s finest

    the court – his planned and deliberate activities over the space of three
    months can hardly be dismissed as a mere “mistake”. Nor can he attribute his
    actions to the immature over-exuberance of a youthful radical.  In truth, the respondent was engaged in a
    diabolical plot that most 19-year-olds would never even think of, let alone
    pursue. Fuelled by fanatical beliefs, he was prepared to engage in the

    responsibility for his wrongdoing, he nonetheless observed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There

    from his conduct and a need to bring home to the offender the enormous dangers

    remains a distance to go.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding that the respondent had taken “some
    valuable steps” towards reformation but that “there remain[ed] a distance to
    go”, the sentencing judge no doubt had in mind the respondent’s unsuccessful
    attempt on the <i>Gardiner</i> hearing to
    reduce to a very significant degree his level of moral blameworthiness. He was
    not prepared to admit that he knew that people would likely die or suffer
    serious injuries from the explosions.  Along the same lines, at the sentencing hearing, the respondent took the
    position that he was merely “a gofer”. The sentencing judge disagreed with that
    characterization. The respondent further tried to suggest, by way of
    mitigation, that there was no real risk that anyone would have been harmed or
    any buildings destroyed because Amara was totally incompetent – and that in any
    event, without the assistance of a police agent, Amara would not have been able
    to obtain the large quantities of ammonium nitrate needed to build the bombs.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge was clearly alive to the danger of
    uncritically accepting the respondent’s assertions that he had seen the light
    and was now a reformed person. He was right to have approached these protestations
    with a healthy degree of scepticism. The respondent’s position at the <i>Gardiner </i>hearing attempting to minimize
    his degree of culpability did not reflect the attitude of someone who had
    accepted responsibility for his wrongdoing and was truly remorseful. His effort
    to reduce the level of his moral blameworthiness could just as easily have been
    seen as an attempt on his part to get away with as much as he could. Moreover, the
    respondent made no attempt to cooperate with the authorities following his
    arrest. He did not provide information about his co-conspirators, nor did he
    offer to testify against them.  Had he
    done so, this would have been much more telling about the extent of his
    reformation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, we accept the sentencing judge’s findings
    that the respondent’s reformation was sincere and that his positive efforts merited
    consideration. These factors served to ameliorate the severity of the sentence
    that the respondent might otherwise have received. That said<span class=GramE>,</span> we believe that his reformative efforts were entitled to less weight than the
    sentencing judge gave them. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       Conclusion on Sentence and Period of Parole
    Ineligibility</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking into account the mitigating factors that the
    sentencing judge considered and giving them the weight they deserve, we think
    that the respondent should have received a sentence in the range of 20 to 25
    years.  Stern sentences in that range are
    meant to send a clear message – those who chose to pursue deadly terrorist
    activities from or in Canada will pay a very heavy price.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having identified the appropriate range of sentence at
    20 to 25 years, we note that Crown counsel, both at the sentencing hearing and
    on appeal, submitted that the respondent should receive a sentence in the range
    of 18 to 20 years.  Obviously, in making
    that submission, Crown counsel could not have known of the approach that this
    court would take to the sentencing of terrorists like the respondent. That
    said, when the court determines that a Crown sentence appeal should be allowed,
    the court will inevitably give considerable weight to the Crown’s position as
    to the appropriate sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in light of all the circumstances, including the
    range proposed by the Crown, we would impose an effective sentence of 20 years,
    which is at the bottom end of the 20 to 25 year range we have identified.  In order to impose an effective sentence of 20
    years, we would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal from sentence and
    increase the respondent’s term of imprisonment from 7 to 13 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be apparent from our reasons that we
    respectfully disagree with the sentencing judge’s decision to reject the
    presumptive period of parole ineligibility (in this case, one half of the
    sentence) set out in s. 743.6(1.2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have already set out our reasons for concluding that,
    in imposing the sentence he did, the sentencing judge under-emphasized the enormity
    of the respondent’s crime and over-emphasized his rehabilitative prospects. These
    reasons apply with equal force to the issue of parole ineligibility. We need
    not repeat them. Suffice it to say that, had the sentencing judge followed the
    approach that we believe he should have, he would have come to a different
    conclusion on the issue of parole ineligibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, an order will go requiring that the
    respondent serve one half of his sentence (6 1/2 years) before he may be released
    on parole. The ancillary orders made by the sentencing judge shall remain the
    same. </p>
