    horrific terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, Canada,

    December 18, 2001.  The Act made significant
    amendments to the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46, gave the police new investigative powers, and created several new
    offences targeting terrorist activities and terrorist groups.  </span></p>

    terrorism-related offences introduced by Bill C-36 hinges on the commission of
    “terrorist activity” as defined in s. 83.01(1) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  The central
    issues in these proceedings involve: (1) the constitutionality and
    interpretation of the statutory definition of “terrorist activity” set out in
    s. 83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b); and (2) the proper approach to be
    taken in sentencing those convicted of terrorism-related offences.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    matters of first impression for this court. The appellant is the first person
    to be tried for terrorism-related offences in Ontario.  After a lengthy trial before a judge alone,
    which included several pre-trial motions, the appellant was acquitted on two of
    the terrorism charges (counts 1 and 2), although he was convicted of included
    offences that did not require proof of terrorist activity.  The appellant was convicted of five terrorism
    offences (counts 3 to 7).  He received
    sentences <span class=SpellE>totalling</span> 10 ½ years, having spent almost
    five years in custody prior to his sentencing.  </span></p>

    brothers and sisters in any and every way possible, whether physically,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That the appellant’s stance on
    Jihad is far from benign, and expressly extends to a willingness to engage in
    violent activities, was revealed by a series of chilling emails that he wrote
    to Khan in September and October 2003.  In these emails, the appellant expressed his support for preparing for
    Jihad by training in warfare and the use of weaponry, by adopting a “war-like
    mentality” against those at “war with Islam”, and by “bringing down … the enemy
    … by whatever means available or necessary”.  The appellant wrote:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For a sincere Muslim, guns, warfare, and weaponry
    are a means of <span class=SpellE>defense</span>, a means of deliverance, and
    something which enables him to carry out the obligation of Jihad. … <i>So engaging in Jihad also requires us to
    prepare in the best of ways</i>. Not only spiritually in Deen, <i>but also train with excellence in warfare
    and the best of weaponry … A war-like mentality is needed against the Kuffar
    (governments, armies, supporters) because they ‘are’ at war with us</i>.  America is at war with Islam. Israel is at
    war with Islam, so we do not treat Ariel Sharon and George Bush with
    compassion, do we?  They have slaughtered
    tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters.  The blood of the Ummah has been spilt. … <i>This is the precise reason for the Jihad, the training, warfare,
    weaponry, and war-like mentality against those who commit acts of aggression</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So under certain specific circumstances, a major
    sin becomes a praiseworthy, noble, and mandatory action … True eco-<span

    institutions and scam large, pulling off elaborate scams worth millions and
    using that for the J.  <span
class=SpellE><i>Its</i></span><i> about bringing down the <span class=SpellE>kuffar</span> enemy dealing blow after blow, by whatever means available or necessary … picture
    this, a young bro wearing an explosive vest walks into a busy Israeli nightclub
    and in midst of all the partying, he presses a button and detonates, killing
    himself and dozens around him.  <span
class=GramE>Suicide or Martyrdom?</span></i> … Now think about this, Islam forbids suicide as a heinous crime, a very
    major sin.  So how on earth can such a
    huge sin <span class=GramE>be</span> considered one of the most noble acts,
    martyrdom? … <i>The reason why this is
    permissible and noble is because there is absolutely NO other way of fighting
    them except this</i> … So sometimes things that seem wrong from face-value due
    to our lack of info or understanding, such as certain operations that <span
class=SpellE>Muj</span> carry out against the <span class=SpellE>kuffar</span>,
    may in fact be very noble deeds with great long-term benefits for the Muslim
    Ummah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]e <span class=GramE>know</span> that the only
    way the Kuffar support their wars are with their economies.  <i>So we
    have to come up with a way that we can drain their economy of all its
    resources, cripple their industries, and bankrupt their systems in place</i>.  All so that they are forced to withdraw their
    troops, so they cannot afford to wage war, get them so entangled with problems
    at home that they dare not worry about attacking us or supporting others in
    attacking us.  We need constant economic
    J, blow after blow, until they cripple and fall, never to rise again. … <i>What did Sept. 11 <span class=SpellE>do</span> to America? … <span class=GramE>Would you not say that the actions of 19 men on

    America down, never to rise again?  Yes,
    I understand that innocent human beings died, but there is absolutely no other
    way of achieving the same objective with the same effect. … Allah <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In July 2003, the appellant
    returned to Pakistan, via London.  He
    remained in Pakistan for approximately two weeks.  Prior to this trip, he had entered into a
    form of covert email correspondence with Junaid Babar (“Babar”), a 34-year old
    American of Pakistani descent who eventually pled guilty in New York City to
    five counts of providing material support or resources to al Qa’eda. Babar
    testified for the Crown at the appellant’s trial.  His evidence about the appellant’s activities
    was especially damning.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to Babar, the
    appellant stayed at his residence while in Pakistan in July 2003.  Khyam was also present.  The appellant and Khyam spent several days at
    a small arms training camp that Babar and others had earlier established in
    northern Pakistan.  After his trip to the
    training camp, the appellant excitedly relayed to Babar that he had fired the
    available camp weaponry, including a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, an AK47
    and a light machine gun.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Babar said that Khyam planned
    to use the training camp for explosives training.  To that end, after the appellant left
    Pakistan, Khyam, Babar and others returned to the training camp and, using
    previously assembled ingredients, successfully detonated an improvised
    explosive device, producing a small crater in the earth.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the explosives
    material was present in Babar’s home when the appellant stayed there, and the
    appellant attended the training camp and used the weapons cached there, Babar
    testified that Khyam’s plan to use the camp for explosives training was unknown
    to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, Babar also said that
    while the appellant was in Pakistan, he gave Khyam money that was intended partially
    for “zakat” – a charitable gift to the poor – and partially for the use of “the
    brothers” in an explosives operation in the United Kingdom or Europe planned by
    Khyam.</span></p>

    returned to Pakistan, via London, for a third time.  He brought supplies obtained by him in London
    from Khyam, including a medical kit, invisible ink pens, two SIM cards<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    cash to Amin, with whom he met while in Islamabad.  Babar understood that he was to use the SIM
    cards to remain in contact with Khyam when transporting detonators from
    Pakistan to Europe.</span></p>

    with Babar to the training camp that he had attended in July, as he wished to
    again fire the grenade launcher stored at the camp.  When this proved impossible due to a shortage
    of ammunition, the appellant returned to Islamabad and flew back to Ottawa
    shortly thereafter.  Before his
    departure, Amin told the appellant to keep him informed of his activities
    through Khyam.</span></p>

    members of the Khyam group did not end there.  The trial judge found that, prior to his July 2003 trip to Pakistan, the
    appellant made available a residence in Pakistan owned by his parents to
    members of the Khyam group.</span></p>

    throughout 2003 and 2004, the appellant provided additional funds – beyond
    those given by him to Amin in October 2003 – to support Babar, Khyam “and the
    bros’ in their jihadist efforts”.  For
    this purpose, the appellant recruited and used a young Muslim woman in Ottawa
    to assist in opening an Ottawa bank account and instructed her to transfer
    money to Khyam and his associates in the United Kingdom from that account and
    other sources on multiple occasions.</span></p>

    was a prototype device intended for potential inner-city use.  For instance, the appellant described the
    frequency of the device to Khyam in these terms: “[I]<span class=SpellE>t’s</span> actually impossible for them near urban areas to block it out because they

    participating in and supporting “armed conflict”, namely, the Islamist
    insurgent fighting in Afghanistan.  The

    first two counts could be grounded on the evidence that the appellant was a
    party to a plan to bomb one or more of several possible targets in the United

    participant with Omar Khyam and others in the London area in a scheme to
    explode improvised explosive devices at a place or places in the United

    not focused on a London, or even a United Kingdom, fertilizer bomb plot, it

    Khyam group’s broader terrorist agenda beyond front line combat in Afghanistan.
    His findings at paras. 134-39 in relation to the individual counts may be
    summarized as follows:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>Count 3           By taking
    weapons training at the camp in northern Pakistan, the appellant had the object
    of enhancing the ability of a terrorist group to facilitate or carry out
    terrorist activity.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>Count 4           The appellant
    deceived a young woman into acting as a conduit to pass funds, including a bank
    card, to Khyam and his group.  The funds
    were for the purpose of enhancing the ability of the group to facilitate or
    carry out terrorist activity.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>Count 5           The appellant
    made his parents’ residence in Pakistan available for the use of Babar, Amin,
    Garcia, or any of the people Khyam needed housing for. Since the relationship
    between the appellant and Khyam involved the pursuit of their common objective
    of violent Jihad, the offer of the residence was to facilitate terrorist
    activity.  It is immaterial that the
    residence was not actually used by members of the terrorist group.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>Count 6           Everything the
    appellant did in relation to developing the remote detonator device, including
    his reports to Khyam and meeting with him in February 2004, amounted to participating
    in or contributing to the activity of a terrorist group for the purpose of
    enhancing the group’s ability to carry out terrorist activity.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>Count 7           The appellant’s
    actions in transporting money, a medical kit, the SIM cards and invisible ink
    pens from Khyam to Babar and Amin; his offer to acquire equipment like night
    vision goggles; his suggestion that Khyam and S. Mahmood come to Canada for
    shooting practice; his offer to provide a course in electronics to Khyam; the
    suggestion that “Immy” be sent on a suicide mission to Israel; and his discussion
    with S. Amin about putting his computer skills to work to assist “the bros” were
    all things knowingly done by the appellant to assist the terrorist purposes of
    the group. </p>

    that the relevant act or omission was committed “in whole or in part for a

    s. 2(a) and s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Section 2(a) protects freedom of religion and

    might engage in the conduct defined as “terrorist activity”, but rather in
    respect of individuals who shared, or could be seen as sharing, some or all of
    the political, religious or ideological beliefs associated with those who actually
    engage in “terrorist activity”.  The
    trial judge took the view that persons who shared or were seen by others as
    sharing views akin to those associated with “terrorist activity” would refrain
    from, or at least be reluctant to, espouse those views, either because of the
    public perception connecting those views to terrorism, or because of the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Even
    in cases, however, in which the politics, religion or ideology of foreign

    help but fall under some sort of shadow.  It is exactly that sort of phenomenon that has given rise to concerns

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    seems to me that the inevitable impact to flow from the inclusion of the

    on the political, religious and ideological beliefs, opinions and expressions
    of persons and groups both in Canada and abroad. <i>Equally inevitable will be the chilling effect Webb </i>[an author

    effect of the sort Professor Stribopoulos [another author cited by the trial

    the definition to be applied to the various offences that required proof of

    the definition of terrorist activity was unconstitutional, the trial judge
    should have declared the entire definition of no force and effect and left it
    to Parliament to decide whether it wished to re-enact the definition without the

    have all upheld its constitutionality:  see <i>Nadarajah</i>, at paras. 29-43<span

    at para. 35.  Alternatively, the Crown
    argues that if the trial judge was correct in his constitutional analysis, he was
    also correct in the remedy he chose and that severance of the motive clause
    from the rest of the definition of “terrorist activity” was the appropriate
    order.</span></p>

    that the motive clause violates s. 2 through its “chilling effect” on those who
    would otherwise be inclined to express political, religious, or ideological
    beliefs that are, or might be seen by the public and the authorities as,
    similar to the views held by individuals associated with “terrorist activity”.  Although the constitutional challenge does
    not allege a personal violation of the appellant’s constitutional rights, the Crown,
    quite properly, does not challenge the appellant’s right to make this argument:  <i>R. v.

    this argument, the terrorism offences in Part II.1, which incorporate “terrorist

    crime under Part II.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The phrase “terrorist activity” does not prohibit
    or criminalize any political, religious, ideological thought, belief or
    opinion.  The phrase defines certain
    conduct.  The definition includes the
    requirement that the defined conduct be performed for a political, religious or
    ideological reason.  The distinction between
    the expression of a belief by means other than those caught by the definition
    of “terrorist activity” and the expression of a belief using “terrorist
    activity” is made explicit in s. 83.01(1.1):</span></p>

    engaged in conduct amounting to “terrorist activity”.  To appreciate the constitutional argument, it

    activity” is complex, having both a conduct and a mental component.  The conduct component, subject to the “armed
    conflict exception” inserted in the final paragraph of the subsection,
    encompasses any act or omission, a conspiracy, attempt or threat to commit any
    act or omission, counselling an act or omission, and being an accessory after the
    fact to an act or omission, that causes one of the five consequences described
    in s. 83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(ii)(A)-(E).  For example, and assuming the armed conflict
    exception does not apply, s. 83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(ii)(A) refers
    to an act or omission that “causes death or serious bodily harm”. The conduct
    component of the definition of “terrorist activity” is established if the Crown
    proves an act or omission that had that consequence.  The conduct component is also established if
    the Crown proves a conspiracy, attempt, threat to commit, or counselling of an
    act or omission that if carried out would cause death or serious bodily harm.  Finally, the conduct component is satisfied
    if the Crown proves that the individual acted as an accessory after the fact to
    an act or omission that caused death or serious bodily harm.      </span></p>

    the intention of bringing about one of the consequences described in

    activity” is made clearer when removed from the dense and abstract language of

    context of the specific findings of fact made by the trial judge at paras.
    89-90. He found that Khyam and others had agreed to cause explosions in the
    United Kingdom and elsewhere.  This agreement
    constitutes an “act or omission” under the definition of “terrorist activity”
    in s. 83.01(1).  The trial judge further
    found that, had the scheme been implemented as planned, there would have been explosions
    that were intended to and would have caused death and destruction of property.  This finding satisfies both the consequence
    component of the definition and one element of the mental component, namely,
    the requirement that the act or conduct be done with the intention of bringing
    about that consequence.  Further, the trial
    judge found that the objectives of the Khyam group included terrorizing
    segments of the public in the United Kingdom and elsewhere with regard to their
    security.  This finding addresses the
    ulterior intention requirement in s. 83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(i)(B).  Finally, and although the trial judge struck the
    motive clause as unconstitutional, he was satisfied that the Khyam group had acted
    in part, at least, for a political, religious or ideological purpose, thus
    satisfying the requirements of s. 83.01(1)(b)(i)(A).  </span></p>

    mental processes that precede and generate conduct are multi-faceted and interrelated.  They can be parsed and labeled in a variety
    of ways.  Conduct may have one or many
    motives.  The same state of mind may be described
    as motive, intention or purpose.  None of
    the labels is intrinsically more accurate than the others.  The distinction between motive and other
    mental states is often one of terminology rather than substance:  B. Fisse, <i>Howard’s

    rea</i>, one can refer to the intention to steal as the burglar’s ulterior
    intention and describe the burglar’s motive as his or her desire for financial

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[91]<span

    part of a crime” does not express a criminal law principle referable to the permitted
    scope of criminal liability, much less a principle of fundamental justice
    protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>. The
    aphorism refers to the interpretive rule that, ordinarily, when interpreting
    the <i>mens rea</i> required for criminal
    culpability, and absent statutory language to the contrary, the reason or
    reasons that cause an accused to engage in prohibited conduct or to choose to
    bring about a prohibited consequence are irrelevant to culpability:  <i>United
    States of America v. Dynar</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462, at pp. 496-97.  The aphorism is also a reflection of the nomenclature
    used to describe the fault component of crimes and, more specifically, to distinguish
    between states of mind that are relevant to culpability as described in the
    statute creating the offence (<i>e.g.</i>, intent,
    purpose), and states of mind that are not relevant to that definition (<i>e.g.</i>, motive):  Colvin &amp; Anand,<sup> </sup>at pp.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In

    motive as relevant to criminal culpability is foreign to Canadian criminal
    law.  Motive plays a part in many aspects
    of the substantive criminal law, including the definition of the fault
    component of some crimes and the definition of exculpatory justifications and
    excuses:  M. Plaxton, “Irruptions of
    Motive in the War on Terror” (2007) 11 Can. Crim. L. R. 233; Colvin &amp; Anand,
    at pp. 192-93.  For example, there are many <i>Criminal Code</i> offences that require
    that the prohibited conduct be done for a specified purpose that is ulterior to
    the conduct component of the crime (<i>e.g.</i>,
    s. 23(1) (accessory after the fact), s. 51 (intimidating Parliament or the
    legislature), s. 52 (sabotage), s. 53 (inciting to mutiny), s. 57(2) (false
    statement in relation to passport), s. 151 (sexual interference), s. 152
    (invitation to sexual touching)).  The
    requirement that the Crown prove “purpose” can refer to different states of
    mind, including the requirement of proof of the reason that precipitated the
    conduct that brought about the intended consequence.  When purpose is used in this sense, it is
    effectively indistinguishable from the concept of motive:  <i>R. v.
    Hibbert</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, at para. 27; <i>R. v. Kerr</i>, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 371, at paras. 26-27.  </span></p>

    crime:  <i>Hibbert</i>, at para. 25.  A
    statutory provision that requires proof of motive is not constitutionally <span

    in the definition of “terrorist activity” signals that Parliament has determined
    that motivation for the conduct described in the definition is a central
    feature of that which distinguishes terrorism from other crimes.  On this view, terrorism is only properly
    described and labeled for criminal law purposes by including certain motives as

    causes a serious interference with or disruption of an essential service, facility

    follow the <i>dicta</i> in <i>Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]o the extent the “activity” in question falls
    outside the violence exception and remains within the scope of s. 2(b)
    protection, (for example because the mode of participation does not involve
    actual violence), it nonetheless involves actions taken in aid of a political,
    religious or ideological objective, by means intended to cause the harmful
    effects that clauses (A) to (E) of s. 83.01(1)(b)(ii) are aimed at, with the
    intention to intimidate or compel action as specified in s. 83.01(1)(b)(i)(B)
    of the definition. ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree with Dawson J. that none of the conduct that falls within “terrorist
    activity” involves expressive activity that advances any of the values underlying
    s. 2(b).  For example, counselling
    someone to engage in conduct that would cause death or serious bodily harm
    hardly encourages the pursuit of truth, participation in the community or
    individual self-fulfillment.  Consequently,
    even if the activity is not violent, it is not expressive conduct for the
    purpose of s. 2(b).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In summary, none of the activity that falls within the definition of
    “terrorist activity” is protected under s. 2(b) for one of two reasons.  First, some, if not all, of the conduct
    involves the use of violence to convey a meaning.  Second, to the extent that the activity does
    not involve the conveying of meaning through violence, it does involve the
    conveying of meaning in a manner that is contrary to and destructive of the
    principles underlying the right to freedom of expression.  As the purpose of the legislation is not to
    limit expression, the fact that it has that effect, but only with respect to a
    form of expression that is destructive of the principles underlying freedom of
    expression, does not constitute an infringement of s. 2(b).  </span></p>

    of the definition infringes the rights protected by s. 2.  However, as outlined above, the trial judge in
    the present case found a violation of s. 2 of the <i>Charter</i> based on his conclusion that the motive clause would inhibit
    persons who wished to engage in conduct that is outside the definition of
    “terrorist activity” from expressing certain beliefs and opinions that might be
    shared by those who were engaged in terrorist activity. A finding of unconstitutionality
    based on a collateral effect on persons whose conduct is not within the terms
    of the statute is, to our knowledge, unique to this case. The impact of
    legislation on persons who are not directly “caught” by the terms of the
    legislation is normally addressed in the context of the proportionality
    analysis required by s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>e.g.</i>,
    see <i>Zundel</i>, at pp. 771-72; <i>R. v. Sharpe</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at
    para. 104.  Section 1, and the
    proportionality analysis required by it, is of course engaged only after it is concluded
    that the legislation breaches a constitutionally protected right.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Even assuming that an indirect effect of a statutory provision can
    render that provision unconstitutional, we reject the trial judge’s conclusion
    that the motive clause is unconstitutional because it has a chilling effect on
    the rights protected by s. 2 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    The problem with the trial judge’s view of the indirect effect of the impugned
    definition is that it is founded entirely on speculation, both as to the existence
    of the “chilling effect” and the cause or source of that “chilling effect”, if
    indeed one exists.  The trial judge
    simply declared that the “chilling effect” on the rights of certain segments of
    our society to freely express themselves was “the inevitable impact” of the
    inclusion of the motive clause in the definition of “terrorist activity”.  In doing so, he relied on similar declarations
    made by academic commentators: see paras. 55-58.</span></p>

    motive clause unconstitutional would presumably fall upon those in the
    community who shared some of the views associated with those who engaged in
    “terrorist activity”, or who shared the cultural or religious background of
    those associated with “terrorist activity”.  Neither this appellant, nor the appellants in <i>Nadarajah</i> and <i>Sriskandarajah</i>,
    led any evidence to support the contention that individuals within any part of
    the community felt constrained in the expression of their beliefs or opinions
    by any part of the terrorism-related provisions, much less specifically by the

    beyond question.  The extradition judge
    in <i>Nadarajah</i>, at paras. 37-42, acknowledged
    the absence of any evidence to support the “chilling effect” argument, but determined
    that it was not fatal to that argument.  In <i>Ahmad</i>, at paras. 130-35, Dawson

    evidence is required to meet that onus.  The
    anti-terrorism legislation has been in place in Canada for almost 10
    years.  Similar legislation operates in
    several other countries.  If the motive
    clause has dampened freedom of expression in certain segments of the community,
    as assumed by the trial judge, one would have thought that the appellants would
    be able to produce, at the very least, some credible anecdotal evidence to that

    effect” of legislation, judicial notice still requires that the fact of which

    threshold for judicial notice is strict: a court may properly take judicial
    notice of facts that are either: (1) so notorious or generally accepted as not

    of the community is reluctant to exercise its rights under s. 2 because of the motive
    clause in the anti-terrorism legislation comes nowhere near to meeting the
    standard required before judicial notice can be taken.  The appellants had the obligation to
    demonstrate the “chilling effect” said to result in the infringement of s. 2 of
    the <i>Charter</i>.  In our view, they could not do so without
    adducing some evidence to support that contention. The absence of evidence
    cannot be overcome by judicial speculation or academic commentary.  The “chilling effect” argument fails for this
    reason alone.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[125]<span

lang=EN-US>There is a second difficulty with the “chilling effect” analysis.  Even if one could assume or take judicial notice
    of the fact that there is a segment of the community that is reluctant to express
    its views because those views may be associated in the public mind with
    “terrorist activity”, the motive clause would thereby be rendered
    unconstitutional only if the appellants demonstrated a connection between that
    reluctance and the motive clause.  Dawson
    J. in <i>Ahmad</i> referred to this
    difficulty at para. 133:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span
lang=EN-US>The problem in the present case is
    that the cause and effect relationship the applicants rely upon is not obvious.</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>  I have no trouble concluding on a common sense basis that some members
    of minority communities have experienced a chill when it comes to the expression
    of their political, religious or ideological views because they are concerned
    they may be seen as extremist and singled out for scrutiny.  Where I have difficulty is in connecting such
    a chill to the motive requirement.… <i>It
    seems to me that any such chill could simply be the result of the general state
    of our society in the post “9/11” environment.  </i>[Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree with Dawson J.’s remarks.  There are many potential explanations for why people might feel a
    chilling effect when it comes to expressing extremist Islamic views.  Perhaps, most obviously, there is the reality
    of the world we live in.  Terrorism and
    the fear and uncertainty terrorism creates are facts of life.  Fear can generate many things, including
    suspicion based on ignorance and stereotyping.  Many, but by no means all, of the major terrorist attacks in the last 10
    years have been perpetrated by radical Islamic groups fueled by a potent mix of
    religious and political fanaticism.  It
    is hardly surprising that, in the public mind, terrorism is associated with the
    religious and political views of radical Islamists.  Nor is it surprising that some members of the
    public extend that association to all who fit within a very broad racial and
    cultural stereotype of a radical Islamist.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In making these observations, we do not intend to condone profiling
    or stereotyping.  We do, however, mean to
    say that the most obvious cause of any “chilling effect” among those whose beliefs
    would be associated in the public mind with the beliefs of terrorist groups is
    the temper of the times, and not a legislative provision that in all
    probability is unknown to the vast majority of persons who are said to be
    “chilled” by its existence: see <i>Reference
    re Marine Transportation Security Regulations</i>, at para. 35. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Section 83.01(1.1) also stands in the way of any finding that the
    motive clause has generated a “chilling effect” on freedom of expression in
    certain segments of the community.  To reason
    that the motive clause causes an individual to be reluctant to express an
    opinion or belief, one must assume that that person is aware of the motive
    clause.  If one makes that assumption,
    one must, it seems to us, also assume that the individual is aware of s.
    83.01(1.1).  That provision clearly
    declares that one need not fear expressing any political, religious or
    ideological belief as long as one does not engage in conduct that falls within
    the meaning of “terrorist activity”.  If
    assumptions are to be made about the effect of legislation, those assumptions
    must be based on the entirety of the relevant provision.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

lang=EN-US> The respondent Crown makes
    the valid point that the motive clause has virtually no effect on the manner in
    which potential terrorist activities are investigated and prosecuted.  The vast majority of terrorist acts are borne
    of political, religious and ideological motivations.  Consequently, motive will play a crucial role
    in the detection and prosecution of terrorist activities.  The investigative focus will fall on persons
    or groups whose beliefs are known or believed to promote or condone terrorist
    conduct.  Where those investigations lead
    to prosecutions, the motive of the accused will no doubt be a central feature
    of the prosecution’s case.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The facts of this case present a good example.  The appellant’s motive was the subject of
    considerable evidence.  To the extent
    that the “chilling effect” on freedom of expression is the product of the
    targeting and prosecution of individuals who have certain motives, that chill
    would exist regardless of whether the motive clause was part of the definition
    of “terrorist activity”.  In other words,
    it is the nature of the activity and the nature of the state response that may
    generate the “chilling effect”, not the content of the legislation.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The irrelevance of the exact terms of the anti-terrorism legislation
    to any potential “chilling effect” is also supported by the absence of any
    evidence suggesting that there is a distinction to be drawn between the
    countries where motive is an element of the definition of “terrorist activity”
    and countries where motive is not an element of that definition.  For example, there was no evidence adduced in
    this case that the “chilling effect” said to exist in Canada does not exist, or
    exists in any different way, in the United States where the anti-terrorism
    legislation does not require proof of motive. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge was concerned that the investigative authorities, in
    the course of efforts to prevent and uncover terrorist activities, would overstep
    their powers and in the course of doing so, sweep within their investigative
    net persons who had done nothing more than bear a religious, cultural or racial
    resemblance to persons stereotyped by authorities as terrorists.  This was certainly an important and proper
    concern.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It is equally important, however, to distinguish between proper and
    improper police conduct.  If the police
    have grounds to believe that someone is engaged in or associated with
    “terrorist activity”, they are not only entitled, they are obliged, to
    investigate that person. Individuals who associate themselves through their conduct
    or statements with the goals or activities of terrorist groups can expect to be
    investigated by the police even though it may turn out that those persons have
    not engaged in any “terrorist activity”.  As long as the police conduct their investigation in a lawful manner,
    any “chilling effect” on those targeted by the investigation is no basis upon
    which to find a <i>Charter</i> infringement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Improper police conduct, such as profiling based exclusively on
    ethnicity or religious belief, is an entirely different matter.  This kind of state conduct is not only unacceptable,
    it is unconstitutional. There is, however, no evidence of any connection
    between these abuses and the motive clause.  Nor can improper conduct by the state actors charged with enforcing
    legislation render what is otherwise constitutional legislation
    unconstitutional. Where the problem lies with the enforcement of a constitutionally
    valid statute, the solution is to remedy that improper enforcement, not to
    declare the statute unconstitutional:  <i>Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v.
    Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1120, at paras. 133-35.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For these reasons, we are satisfied that the appellant in this case
    and the appellants in the extradition appeals have failed to show that the
    motive clause has caused any “chilling effect” on the rights of those who do
    not engage in “terrorist activity”.  We
    make one final point.  It seems to us,
    although we could perhaps be accused of the same speculation we have attributed
    to the trial judge, that persons who are inclined to express views that support
    some of the beliefs or goals (but not the methods) of terrorist groups, might
    well be dissuaded from openly expressing those views because of the terrorist
    activities of those who hold similar views.  A person who would never engage in “terrorist activity” may refrain from
    expressing a particular point of view for fear of being identified with true
    terrorists who happen to share the same belief.  On this analysis, it is the actions of the terrorists and not the
    legislation targeting their activities that creates the “chill”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>We agree with the Crown that the trial judge erred in holding that
    the motive clause was unconstitutional and of no force and effect. The
    constitutional remedy granted by the trial judge was to sever the motive
    requirement in s. 83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(i)(A) of the definition
    of “terrorist activity”. As a result, the Crown was not required to satisfy

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In view of our conclusion that the motive requirement is not
    unconstitutional, the trial judge erred in granting the remedy he did.  However, that error is of no moment because,
    as the trial judge observed at para. 89, even if the motive requirement was an
    essential ingredient of these offences, the Crown would have proved it was
    established based on the evidence adduced against the appellant: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    say that because there is such an abundance of evidence that what was being

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In his opening address at trial, Crown counsel described the nature
    of the Crown’s case in these terms:   </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In late 2003 and early 2004, a terrorist group was
    plotting to build and then detonate within the United Kingdom one or more
    improvised explosive devices based on 600 kilograms of ammonium nitrate-based
    fertilizer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If an improvised explosive device based on 600
    kilograms of ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer were to be detonated in a
    populated area, the result would be massive destruction and loss of life.  If parceled into separate bombs, the
    explosions would cause similar destruction and loss of life distributed over a
    wider area.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Possible targets discussed by members of the group
    included a shopping mall in Kent, a nightclub in central London and the high
    voltage electricity and high pressure gas supply networks in England and
    Wales.  The aim was to cause death,
    injury and damage for religious and political purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, Crown counsel described the offence charged in count 7 –
    the knowing facilitation of a terrorist activity – as: “knowingly facilitating
    a terrorist activity, namely the fertilizer bomb plot undertaken by ... a
    terrorist group in the United Kingdom.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant claims that, based on this early articulation of the
    Crown’s case, the thrust of the defence advanced at trial was to attempt to
    show that he knew nothing about the U.K. fertilizer bomb plot and that his
    activities were designed merely to further his desired participation in the
    insurgency in Afghanistan.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that, in response to this defence strategy,
    the Crown improperly expanded the nature of its case at the end of trial by
    alleging in closing submissions that the terrorist activity underlying the
    offences charged “resided within a greater common criminal design: violent
    Jihad wherever it might opportunistically be committed.”  The appellant contends that this constituted
    a material shift in the Crown’s case at a late stage of the trial, thereby
    compromising trial fairness and occasioning a miscarriage of justice. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We did not find it necessary to call on the Crown to address this
    argument.  Simply put, the appellant’s contention
    that the Crown impermissibly recast its case against him ignores the basic
    distinction between formal particulars and the prosecution’s chosen theory of
    an accused’s criminal liability.  As this
    court stated at p. 286 in <i>R. v. Groot</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 280 (C.A.), aff’d [1999] 3 S.C.R. 664: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is important to distinguish between particulars
    under s. 587 of the <i>Code</i> and
    particulars of the theory of the Crown.  While the Crown is bound to prove formal particulars, subject to the
    surplusage rule, particulars are distinguished from the Crown’s theory which it
    is not bound to prove.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>See also <i>R.
    v. Ranger</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 134.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>More recently, a majority of the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Pickton</i>, 2010 SCC 32, reiterated
    that the Crown has the right to modify its theory or strategy as the trial
    progresses.  Citing Binnie J.
    (dissenting, but not on this point) in <i>R.
    v. Rose</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262, at para. 27, the majority in <i>Pickton</i> noted at para. 19: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The notion that it is sufficient for the accused to
    respond to the “Crown theory of the case” also suffers from the practical
    difficulty that the Crown’s theory of the case is a moving target that has to
    adjust to meet new or changing circumstances during the trial, including what
    the Crown hears in the defence closing address. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, in the absence of formal particulars regarding the terrorist
    activity alleged, it would have been unobjectionable for the Crown to adjust
    the theory of its case in response to the evidence at trial as it evolved.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In this case, Crown counsel’s opening depiction of the appellant’s criminal
    conduct was not confined to his alleged involvement in a fertilizer bomb plot,
    in London or elsewhere.  Early in his
    opening address, Crown counsel stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Throughout the years 2002, 2003 and until his
    arrest in 2004, Khawaja participated in and contributed to the London
    fertilizer bomb plot and <i>other activities
    of the Omar Khyam group</i> by numerous e-mail exchanges and meetings, both in
    London and Pakistan, with various associates of the terrorist group.  [Emphasis added.]<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It was therefore clear from the outset of trial that the Crown’s
    theory of liability was not <span class=SpellE>centred</span> exclusively on a
    fertilizer bomb plot.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Moreover, on the facts of this case, the defence cannot be said to
    have been taken by surprise by the Crown’s contention that the appellant
    knowingly worked in concert with terrorists to achieve commonly-held terrorist
    aims. The record confirms the Crown’s assertion before this court that evidence
    of the Khyam group’s aims and of the appellant’s desire “to advance<i> </i>Jihad on all fronts”, formed part of
    the Crown’s case at trial.  There is no
    suggestion that the Crown’s disclosure of this evidence was inadequate or
    deficient.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant elected not to testify or lead any evidence in answer
    to the Crown’s case.  Nor did he seek from
    the Crown formal particulars of any of the offences charged.  Of course, had he done so, the Crown would
    have been bound to prove any particulars provided.  While the appellant was entitled to make
    these tactical decisions, he cannot now complain that he was denied the
    opportunity to know, and to attempt to meet, the Crown’s case as established by
    the evidence actually led at trial.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> Finally, the authorities
    relied on by the appellant in support of the proposition that the Crown cannot
    seek and obtain a conviction on a different basis than is presented in its case
    to the court – <i>R. v. Wynnychuk</i> (1962), 132 C.C.C. 227 (Alta. C.A.), <i>R.

    by subsequent cases: see <i>R. v. Drolet</i>,
    [1989] R.J.Q. 295 (C.A.), aff’d [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1107 and <i>R. v. Pincemin</i>, [2005] 11 W.W.R. 55 (Sask. C.A.), at para. 35.  Additionally, the cases he relied on are
    distinguishable on the facts. They involved trials in which the accused
    testified in his own defence and admitted to committing the same or a related
    offence, but on a different occasion than that in regard to which the Crown
    called evidence in its case in chief: see <i>Motto</i>,
    at para. 5; <i>Wynnychuk</i>, at pp.

lang=EN-US>As we have said, at the close of the Crown’s case, the defence moved
    for directed verdicts of acquittal on all counts. The defence sought to rely on
    the “armed conflict exception” to the definition of terrorist activity set out
    in s.&nbsp;83.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as a complete answer to all the offences
    charged.  This exception excludes from
    the definition of terrorist activity:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>an</span> act or omission that is
    committed during an armed conflict and that, at the time and in the place of

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The defence position was that the appellant’s activities were
    designed solely to further his desired participation in and support of “armed
    conflict” in Afghanistan.  The defence maintained
    that the Crown bore the evidential onus of establishing that the armed conflict
    exception was inapplicable because the appellant’s actions did not comply with
    customary or conventional international law applicable to the war in
    Afghanistan.  As the Crown failed to
    discharge this onus, the exception was engaged.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge disagreed. He ruled that the armed conflict
    exception was inapplicable and irrelevant in this case, reasoning that the
    appellant was not part of an armed force or involved in any armed conflict. He
    was of the view that the exception found in s. 83.01(1)(b)(ii) of the
    definition: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>applies</span> to those actually
    engaged in armed combat.  In my view, the
    term ‘during’ has the meaning of ‘in the course of’ and does not just mean
    ‘contemporaneously with,’ or ‘at the same time as.’  The exception shields those who do acts while
    engaged in an armed conflict that would otherwise fit the definition of
    terrorist activity from prosecution as terrorists as long as the acts are
    within the internationally recognized principles governing warfare.  Momin Khawaja was not so engaged.  His actions in Canada, in the U. K. and in
    Pakistan cannot, in my view, be regarded as falling outside the definition of
    ‘terrorist activity’ by reference to the ‘armed conflict’ exception.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

    was obliged to establish that the exception was inapplicable based on evidence
    that the appellant’s acts did not accord with international law.  He held at para. 127: “There is no burden on
    the prosecution to negative or establish that the exception is

    to revisit his earlier ruling that the armed conflict exception did not
    apply.  The trial judge acceded to this
    request and again concluded that the exception was inapplicable.  In his reasons for judgment, he held that:
    (1) the appellant, Babar and members of the Khyam group were not engaged in
    “armed conflict” within the meaning of that term under the exception, and the
    exception did not extend to the appellant’s and the Khyam group’s
    “non-combatant” activities; (2) there was no armed conflict in Canada, the
    United Kingdom or Pakistan where the appellant’s relevant acts were carried

lang=EN-US>Before this court, the appellant renews his argument that the armed
    conflict exception applies to exempt his actions from the ambit of “terrorist
    activity” as defined under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He submits that the exception was engaged at
    trial because the Crown conceded on the directed verdicts motion that the war
    in Afghanistan was a form of “armed conflict” and that the insurgent fighting
    in that country constituted “terrorist activity”.  Given these concessions, the appellant says
    it was incumbent on the Crown to establish that the exception was inapplicable
    based on evidence that his impugned acts did not comply with international law
    governing the conflict in Afghanistan. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[158]<span

lang=EN-US>We begin with the purpose of the armed conflict exception.  The exception is concerned with armed
    conflict in the context of the rules of war established by international
    law.  It is designed to exclude
    activities sanctioned by international law from the reach of terrorist activity
    as defined in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  We agree with Sproat J.’s observation in <i>R. v. N.Y.</i>, 2008 CanLII 24543 (ON S.C.),
    at para. 12, that, “[t]he armed conflict exception reflects the well recognized
    principle … that combatants in an armed conflict, who act in accordance with
    international law, do not commit any offence.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The parties accept that, where shown to apply, the exception operates
    much like a traditional defence.  An
    accused is entitled to have all <span class=SpellE>defences</span> put to a
    jury that are realistically available on the evidence.  As the Supreme Court of Canada held in <i>R. v. Cinous</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at
    para. 50, <i>per</i> McLachlin C.J. and
    Bastarache J.: “[A] defence should be put to a jury if and only if there is an
    evidential foundation for it”.  The
    inquiry into whether there is an evidential foundation for a defence is
    referred to as the “air of reality test”: <i>Cinous</i>,
    at para. 50; see also <i>R. v. Gunning</i>,
    [2005] 1 S.C.R. 627, at para. 29, <i>per</i> Charron J.  The air of reality test
    applies to all <span class=SpellE>defences</span> and all requisite elements of
    a defence.  Consequently, if evidential
    support for a necessary element of a defence is lacking, the air of reality
    test is not met: <i>Cinous</i>, at paras. </span><span
lang=FR-CA>57, 82; <i>R. v. Ribic</i> (2008), 238 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), at para. </span><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>During oral argument before this court, the appellant did not
    dispute that the air of reality test applies to the armed conflict exception.  Rather, he argued that the test was satisfied
    by virtue of the Crown’s concessions on the directed verdicts motion,
    above-described.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We disagree.  The Crown did
    not concede on the directed verdicts motion that the exception was implicated, but
    rather maintained that there was no air of reality to the armed conflict
    exception in this case. Indeed, the second “concession” by the <span
class=GramE>Crown, that</span> the insurgent fighting in Afghanistan
    constituted terrorist activity, dooms the appellant’s argument that the exception
    operated in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The relevant inquiry in respect of the exception was whether there
    was anything in the evidence to suggest that the appellant’s activities: (1)
    were undertaken while an armed conflict was in progress, and (2) were in
    accordance with the rules of war established by international law applicable to
    that armed conflict.  This is not a
    question of evidential onus.  It is a
    question of whether there was some evidential support for the invocation of the
    armed conflict exception based on the nature of the appellant’s activities.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On the directed verdicts motion, Crown counsel argued that, in order
    for the exception to apply, the evidence must establish that the appellant
    actually participated in the theatre of war where the relevant armed conflict
    was underway.  The trial judge appears to
    have accepted this submission, observing at para. 128 of his reasons: “There
    was no … armed conflict in Canada, the United Kingdom or in Pakistan where the
    acts with which Khawaja is charged, were carried out.”   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On appeal, the Crown conceded that this narrow construction of the
    exception is inappropriate.  We
    agree.  The availability of the exception
    does not require proof of an accused’s physical presence in an area of armed
    conflict.  Nor does it contemplate that
    an accused’s impugned acts or omissions must be carried out within the
    territorial limits of an area of armed conflict.  As we have already said, all that is required
    to trigger the exception is some evidence that: (1) an accused’s acts or omissions
    were committed “during” an armed conflict; and (2) those acts or omissions, at
    the time and at the place of their commission, accorded with international law
    applicable to the armed conflict at issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This interpretive error, however, is of no moment. There was simply
    no evidence in this case that the appellant acted in accordance with
    international law, or that the hostilities by the insurgents in Afghanistan
    were undertaken in compliance with international law.  As the Crown succinctly argued in its factum:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here is not one iota of evidence in this case
    which suggests that the Appellant has any inclination that laws of war and
    [international humanitarian law] exist and what they are, much less that he has
    the slightest desire or intention to obey or observe these principles. Equally,
    as the Appellant’s counsel acknowledged, there was no evidence that the ‘side’
    of the armed conflict he claimed to be supporting behaved in any way
    consistently with international law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree with the Crown’s submission that the appellant’s own emails
    belie any suggestion that he viewed the violent Jihad that he espoused as
    lawful.  Contrary to the central tenets
    of international humanitarian law, he made no distinction between civilians and
    soldiers or lawful combatants.  Indeed,
    his emails reveal that he supported the indiscriminate and random murder of
    civilians, for instance, by means of a suicide attack in a crowded public venue
    in Israel or by terrorist attacks similar to those in the United States on
    September 11, 2001.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Moreover, the appellant’s claim that his actions were directed
    solely at supporting the insurgency in Afghanistan is contradicted by the trial
    judge’s unchallenged factual findings.  The trial judge expressly held at paras. 130-31 that the appellant knew
    of and supported the Khyam group’s terrorist objectives, which extended beyond
    Jihad-related activities in Afghanistan:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Momin Khawaja... knew that the group he was
    training with [and] supporting... was far more than just a support mechanism
    for front line armed combat in accordance with the international rules of
    war.  His knowledge extended to the
    broader terrorist activity that the group had, in whole or in part, as its
    purpose.  Babar testified that they all
    shared an appetite for violent Jihad.  Khawaja … shared [the group’s] broad vision of economic terror
    throughout the western world. … He shared its appetite for suicide bombing in
    countries including Israel.  … He was
    willing to help in other ways, offering to do so on several occasions and telling
    Khyam he was ‘<i>… starting to work on a few
    other much more sophisticated projects that can be of great benefit to the J …’</i> and would speak to Khyam about them when they met.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, there is ample evidence apart from the
    support and preparation for violent Jihad with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan or
    elsewhere, establishing that Momin Khawaja knew he was dealing with a group
    whose objects and purposes included activity that meets the <i>Code</i> definition of terrorist activity. <span

    of hostilities by the insurgent fighters in Afghanistan” based on daily news
    reports of the deaths of civilians and military personnel in Afghanistan (at

    judicial notice, there was also evidence in the form of the appellant’s own
    words that supported the trial judge’s finding that the ulterior intention

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Crown premised its case on proof of the appellant’s

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in the alternative, there is no evidence that the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>in</span> the further alternative,

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[178]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>These arguments may be dealt with summarily.  First, for the reasons already set out, the
    Crown’s case at trial did not rest solely on proof of the appellant’s knowledge
    of and involvement in the U.K. fertilizer bomb plot.  Moreover, nothing in counts 3 to 7 or in the
    Crown’s submissions at trial confined the offences underlying those counts to
    activities in relation to a fertilizer bomb plot.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[179]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, the trial judge expressly found that the Khyam group was a
    “terrorist group”.  The phrase “terrorist
    group” is defined under s. 83.01(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, in part, as: “(a) an entity that has as one of its purposes or
    activities facilitating or carrying out any terrorist activity”.  This finding was amply supported by the

    participation and support included receiving training, providing money and
    supplies, furnishing the use of a home in Pakistan, constructing a remote
    detonator device with the intent that it be used to trigger an explosion in
    London or elsewhere, proposing to thereafter build 30 such devices, and
    offering to provide other assistance as needed by the terrorist group.  We have no hesitation in affirming the trial

    served by the time of sentencing.  At the

    refused to specify a precise arithmetic formula for assigning a value to the
    credit for time served.  Rather, he simply
    noted at para. 47 that he took this period of pre-trial custody into account in
    determining the sentences in this case. </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[189]<span

lang=EN-US>The trial judge provided clear and comprehensive reasons for sentencing:  (2009), 248 C.C.C. (3d) 233. His task was not
    an easy one. Although he was presented with sentencing precedents from around
    the world, this was, as he observed, “the first sentencing under Canada’s Part
    II.1 Terrorism provisions”, which contain several sentencing provisions that
    apply specifically to terrorist activity:  see Appendix A to these reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[190]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge approached his task in an orderly and coherent
    fashion. He applied traditional principles of sentencing where appropriate and
    modified them as necessary to give effect to the new terrorist sentencing
    provisions as he understood them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[191]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Our reasons for interfering with the sentences he imposed can be
    organized into two categories of concern. First, the trial judge made three
    specific errors in his reasons for sentence that warrant appellate intervention:
    (1) the trial judge erred in assessing the appellant’s level of determination;
    (2) the trial judge erred in failing to treat the absence of any evidence of the
    appellant’s rehabilitative prospects as a critical factor in sentencing; and
    (3) the trial judge erred in interpreting s. 83.26 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[192]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, the trial judge erred in his overall approach to sentencing
    the appellant.  As we will explain, the
    sentencing of terrorists requires particular regard to three critical factors:
    (1) the unique nature of terrorism-related offences and the special danger that
    these crimes pose to Canadian society; (2) the degree of continuing danger that
    the offender presents to society; and (3) the need for the sentence imposed to
    send a clear message to would-be terrorists that Canada is not a safe haven
    from which to pursue their subversive and violent ambitions.  In failing to properly apply these
    considerations, the trial judge imposed a sentence that was manifestly unfit.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The Crown at trial submitted that the appellant should receive a
    life sentence, just as Khyam and his associates had received in England for
    their roles in the U.K. fertilizer bomb plot: see <i>Khyam</i>, at para. 2. The trial judge refused to give effect to the
    Crown’s submission, stating at para. 37 of his reasons for sentence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am not persuaded that Momin Khawaja should be
    characterized as a similar offender in similar circumstances as those [Khyam’s]
    men. He was a willing helper and supporter, but Khyam [and his associates] <i>were away out in front of Momin Khawaja in
    terms of their determination to bring death, destruction and terror to innocent
    people</i>. In my view, Momin Khawaja’s offences, the circumstances in which
    they were committed and his personal circumstances do not warrant his being
    sentenced to life imprisonment. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[194]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Leaving the appellant’s personal circumstances aside for the moment,
    we are respectfully of the view that the trial judge’s finding that Khyam and
    his associates “were away out in front” of the appellant “in terms of their
    determination to bring death, destruction and terror to innocent people” is not
    borne out by the record. On the contrary, the record attests not only to the
    depth of the appellant’s commitment to violent Jihad, but also, as his emails
    show, his willingness to do anything and go anywhere to promote violent Jihad.
    He was eager to get on with the job and displeased that things were not moving
    as quickly as he would have liked. He was obsessed with the cause, fanatic in
    his determination to establish Islamic dominance, seemingly at any cost, and
    eager to assist in bringing about the destruction of western culture and
    civilization.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[195]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge was not unaware of these features of the evidence.
    At paras. 130-31 of his reasons for convicting the appellant, he summarized the
    nature and extent of the appellant’s involvement with Khyam and his supporters.
    The trial judge’s salient findings about the appellant’s aspirations in
    providing the Khyam group with financial and other support, including his
    efforts to build remote detonator devices to enable the group to detonate IEDs,
    are as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant knew that the group he was

    Rawalpindi to, transporting supplies for, offering to train in electronics,
    offering to buy equipment for, offering to help with other projects, and
    building triggering devices to enable to remotely detonate IEDs for, shared an
    appetite for violent Jihad; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant was aware that the group’s
    activity included guerrilla and sniper training and sending its members to
    different parts of the world to engage in violent Jihadist activities; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant shared the group’s broad vision of
    economic terror throughout the western world and he shared its appetite for
    suicide bombing in countries including Israel; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant told <span class=SpellE>Khyam</span> he was ‘<span class=SpellE><i>startin</i></span><i> to work on a few other much more
    sophisticated projects that can be of great benefit to the J...</i>’; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>the</span> appellant’s most
    tangible and visible facilitation of the group’s terrorist activity was his
    work in developing the hifidigimonster, which was intended to serve as the
    remote trigger for an IED; he agreed to build about 30 of them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[196]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In light of those findings, we fail to see on what basis the trial
    judge was able to differentiate the appellant’s level of determination to bring
    about death and destruction from that of Khyam and his terrorist followers. In
    fairness to the trial judge, perhaps he was merely saying that Khyam and his
    followers were further along in terms of realizing their violent plans. But if
    that is what he meant, we do not consider the distinction to be significant.
    The fact that the appellant may have lagged behind his co-conspirators in this
    regard does not speak to his level of determination, nor does it attenuate the
    degree of his moral blameworthiness. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>The trial judge recognized at para. 25 that, in cases involving
    terrorist activity, “denunciation, deterrence, both personal and general, and
    protection of society must weigh heavily in the sentencing process.” At the
    same time, he observed at para. 26 that “the potential for rehabilitation and
    promotion of a sense of responsibility on the part of the offender cannot be
    overlooked.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[198]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The question of reformation presented a problem in the appellant’s
    case because, as the trial judge remarked at para. 27:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he
    Court knows virtually nothing about his potential for reformation, of any sense
    of responsibility or of any remorse he may feel for his criminal conduct, or of
    the likelihood of his re-offending. The only words heard from him throughout
    these proceedings were his pleas of ‘not guilty’ when arraigned and his answer
    ‘no’ when asked if he wished to say anything before I determined what sentences
    to impose. The purpose of a pre-sentence report is to provide information about
    an offender, including as to his “maturity, character, behavior, attitude, and
    willingness to make amends.” This would assist the court in imposing sentence.
    Neither Momin Khawaja nor his parents were willing to be interviewed in the
    course of the preparation of the court-ordered pre-sentence report, and so it
    was of limited value.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[199]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>After observing that he was at a loss to know what to make of the
    dearth of information about the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation, the
    trial judge effectively treated this absence of information as a neutral factor
    in the sentencing process, stating at para. 29:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While I cannot regard this silence, this dearth of
    information as an aggravating factor, it can lead to only one inference, and
    that is that there is nothing that can be said on behalf of Momin to lend
    weight to the mitigating factors relating to his rehabilitation, including his
    taking responsibility for his actions, making amends, feeling remorse or
    determination not to re-offend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[200]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>With respect, by treating this lack of evidence at the sentencing
    hearing in this manner, the trial judge fell into serious error. Far from being
    a neutral factor, the absence of any evidence of the appellant’s remorse or of his
    prospects for reformation should have been treated as a significant indicator
    of his present and future dangerousness. Absent convincing evidence that he no
    longer subscribed to violent Jihad at the time of sentencing (evidence the
    appellant could have led without compromising his conviction appeal), the trial
    judge ought to have found that the appellant continues to pose a serious threat
    to society and is likely to do so for the indefinite future. In the absence of
    any evidence of rehabilitation, there was no reason to conclude that the
    appellant would not engage in terrorist activity again if given the opportunity
    to do so. The trial judge should have viewed him in that light and sentenced
    him accordingly. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[201]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We add this observation. Consideration of an offender’s prospects
    for rehabilitation is a relevant factor on sentencing even in terrorism cases.  That said, the import of rehabilitation as a
    mitigating circumstance is significantly reduced in this context given the unique
    nature of the crime of terrorism and the grave and far-reaching threat that it
    poses to the foundations of our democratic society:  see our reasons in <i>R. v. Khalid</i>, released concurrently with these reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[202]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The important point in this case is that there is simply no evidence
    at all of any rehabilitative potential on the part of the appellant. On the
    contrary, the evidence established that this is a man who had written that he
    “wish[<span class=SpellE>ed</span>] to be with the Mujahideen in the front-lines
    of Jihad”; who described 9/11 as “the most accurate, effective, and honorable
    way of conducting economic [Jihad]” and who wrote “imagine if there were 10
    Sept 11’s, wouldn’t that accurately bring America down, never to rise again?
    Yes, I understand that innocent human beings died, but there is absolutely no
    other way of achieving the same objective with the same effect.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[203]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In cases like this, where an offender has shown a willingness to participate
    in the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and there are good grounds
    for believing that he or she is likely to remain a serious danger for an
    indeterminate time, the need to segregate such offenders from society for
    society’s protection must be the predominate purpose of any sentence. And it is
    in that sense that the trial judge failed to accord appropriate weight in the
    sentencing process to the absence of any evidence of the appellant’s prospects
    for rehabilitation.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Section 83.26 of the <i>Criminal

    involving terrorist activity. It reads in part as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>83.26
    A sentence, other than one of life imprisonment, imposed on a person for an
    offence under any of sections 83.02 to 83.04 and 83.18 to 83.23 shall be served

lang=EN-US>That provision clearly applied in this case. The appellant was being

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[206]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While the trial judge recognized that s. 83.26 applied in the
    appellant’s case, his reasons show that he had difficulty harmonizing it with
    s. 718.2(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    which reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>718.2

lang=EN-US>The trial judge addressed the potential conundrum created by the two
    provisions at para. 39: “Accordingly, the sentences I impose must be
    consecutive terms. At the same time, however, in light of s. 718.2(c) I must
    ensure that in their totality, they are not <i>unduly
    long or harsh</i>” (emphasis in original).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[208]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge indicated that he felt constrained by the totality
    principle described by Lamer C.J. in <i>R.
    v. C.A.M.</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 42, which “requires a sentencing
    judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for multiple
    offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the
    overall culpability of the offender.” As noted by Lamer C.J. at para. 43: “Whether
    under the rubric of the ‘totality principle’ or a more generalized principle of
    proportionality, Canadian courts have been reluctant to impose single and
    consecutive fixed-term sentences beyond 20 years.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[209]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Faced with this seeming dilemma, the trial judge imposed modest
    sentences on counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 and token sentences on counts 6 and 7. He did
    so presumably in the belief that s.&nbsp;83.26 speaks to the form the sentences
    are to take rather than their overall length, which is to remain within the
    customary upper range. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[210]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>With respect, we have difficulty with the trial judge’s
    interpretation of s. 83.26. That interpretation effectively neutralizes the
    provision and instead endorses a “business as usual” approach to the sentencing
    of terrorists. In our view, s. 83.26 reflects Parliament’s intention that the
    general principle of totality must be moderated or altered in the case of
    terrorism-related crimes. This provision signals that, when offenders are
    convicted of a number of such crimes, total sentences will be higher than they
    otherwise would be, and the customary upper range for consecutive fixed-term sentences
    will not be applicable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[211]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In this regard, we note that in the realm of conventional offences,
    a practice has developed in this country whereby sentences in the range of 15
    to 20 years have become the default position where it is felt that a life
    sentence is unwarranted.  That, however,
    is a matter of custom, not principle.  Indeed, the custom was soundly rejected as a matter of principle in <i>C.A.M.</i>, the very case that the trial judge
    cited in support of treating s. 83.26 as essentially cosmetic in nature.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    core issue in this appeal concerns whether or not Parliament intended fixed-term
    sentences under the <i>Code</i> to generally

    for multiple offences involving consecutive terms of imprisonment. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    central argument advanced by the proponents of such a ceiling is that
    Parliament, by fixing the default parole ineligibility period for any numerical
    sentence beyond 20 years (absent an order under s. 741.2) at seven years,
    implicitly intended to cap numerical sentences at 20 years. Given the fact that
    an offender sentenced to 30 or 40 years is still eligible for full parole at
    seven years, the suggestion is that Parliament saw little utility in such
    lengthy terms of imprisonment.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At para. 56, Lamer C.J. responded to that argument as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With the greatest respect, <i>I find no evidence in either the Code or the Corrections Act that
    Parliament intended to constrain a trial judge’s traditionally broad sentencing
    discretion through the imposition of a qualified legal ceiling on numerical
    sentences pegged at 20 years’ imprisonment. Rather, in my reading of both
    statutes, </i>beyond setting statutory maximum and minimum sentences which
    reflect the relative severity of different offences, <i>Parliament intended to vest trial judges with a wide ambit of authority
    to impose a sentence which is “just and appropriate” under the circumstances
    and which adequately advances the core sentencing objectives of deterrence,
    denunciation, rehabilitation and the protection of society</i>. Accordingly, in
    my view, whether or not life imprisonment is available as a maximum sentence in
    the particular case, <i>there is no pre-set
    ceiling on fixed-term sentences under the Code</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

lang=EN-US>In the course of his analysis, Lamer C.J. reviewed the origins of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The offender remains under the strict control of
    the parole system, and the offender’s liberty remains significantly curtailed
    for the full duration of the offender’s numerical or life sentence. The
    deterrent and denunciatory purposes which animated the original sentence remain
    in force, notwithstanding the fact that the conditions of sentence have been
    modified. <i>The goal of specific deterrence
    is still advanced, since the offender remains supervised to the extent and
    degree necessary to prevent possible crime, and since the offender remains
    under the shadow of <span class=SpellE>reincarceration</span> if he or she
    commits another crime. As well, the goal of denunciation continues to operate,
    as the offender still carries the societal stigma of being a convicted offender
    who is serving a criminal sentence.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>

lang=EN-US>With respect to minimum periods of parole ineligibility such as
    those established in s. 120(1) of the <i>Corrections
    and Conditional Release Act</i>, S.C. 1992, c. 20 (the lesser of 1/3 of the
    sentence or 7 years), the Chief Justice observed at para. 64 that in fixing
    such periods, “Parliament seems to have concluded that a minimum period of
    physical confinement was necessary to advance the cause of general deterrence
    and denunciation <i>even if the offender was
    completely rehabilitated and posed absolutely no threat to society at the time
    of sentence</i>” (emphasis added). While recognizing that the 7-year default
    period under s. 120(1) of the <i>Corrections
    and Conditional Release Act</i> constituted the period of physical confinement
    that Parliament considered necessary to vindicate the principles of deterrence
    and denunciation, Lamer C.J. emphasized at para. 65 that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>[T]here is no
    indication that the default parole ineligibility rules exhaust a court’s
    ability to advance the goals of deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation and
    the protection of society through the imposition of a numerical sentence beyond

    may be subject to change after seven years, the interaction of well-accepted
    sentencing principles could still require that the offender remain under the
    supervisory aegis of the parole system (if not under imprisonment) for well
    beyond 20 years. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

    saw “no reason why numerical sentences in Canada ought to be <i>de facto</i> limited at 20 years as a matter
    of judicial habit or convention.” He recognized at para. 73 that, for “many of
    the lesser crimes presently before our courts” sentences beyond 20 years would
    be “grossly excessive, and probably cruel and unusual.” However, he also noted that

lang=EN-US>We have reviewed <i>C.A.M.</i> at
    some length because in our view, it helps shed light on Parliament’s purpose in
    enacting s. 83.26. In short, we believe that in enacting that provision,
    Parliament intended to send a message that terrorism is a crime that warrants
    special consideration and it is to be treated differently for sentencing
    purposes. Parliament could have evidenced this intention in a variety of ways
    as, for example, by legislating minimum sentences for terrorist activity. By
    enacting s. 83.26, it chose to signal its intention by mandating the imposition
    of consecutive sentences for terrorism offences that are not punished by a life
    sentence.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"

'>[13]</span></span></span></a> If
    giving effect to this intention means imposing sentences of more than 20 years
    in some instances where a life sentence is either unavailable or unwarranted,
    trial judges should not feel constrained from doing so by reason of a 20-year
    fixed ceiling custom that has no foundation in sentencing principles or policy. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[219]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This view of s. 83.26 fits with the approach we believe should be
    taken in the sentencing of terrorists. Specifically, where the terrorist
    activity, to the knowledge of the offender, is designed to or is likely to
    result in the indiscriminate killing of innocent human beings, trial judges
    should consider very stiff sentences, including life imprisonment. And in those
    cases where a life sentence is found to be inappropriate, trial judges should determine
    the appropriate length of sentence having regard to the special sentencing
    provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i> applicable to terrorism offences, the unique nature of terrorism-related
    crimes, and the enormity of the offence or offences at hand. This process will
    often result in sentences that are beyond the 15 to 20-year range that the
    courts have traditionally imposed in respect of serious crimes where a life
    sentence is not warranted. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[220]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In advocating this sentencing approach to terrorist-related activity
    that, to the offender’s knowledge, is designed to or is likely to result in the
    indiscriminate killing of innocent human beings, we are not suggesting that
    there will never be cases of that nature for which the appropriate sentence
    will be within or below the 15 to 20-year customary range. For example, full
    and meaningful cooperation by the offender with law enforcement authorities in
    the detection of terrorists and terrorist activity may well alleviate against
    the imposition of longer than customary sentences. Such cooperation is always
    significant for sentencing purposes and particularly so in the case of
    terrorist-related crimes. By their nature, such crimes tend to be shrouded in
    secrecy and usually involve numerous people acting at different times, different
    places and in different ways. The heads of such conspiracies will generally be
    difficult to detect. Some may reside in foreign jurisdictions. Information from
    those lower down in the chain may prove invaluable to the authorities and lead
    to the capture of such individuals before they can perpetrate atrocities. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[221]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Cooperation is but one example of the type of mitigating conduct
    that may alleviate against the imposition of longer than customary sentences in
    terrorism cases. We use it to emphasize the fundamental principle that
    sentencing remains a highly individual process and that the punishment imposed
    must be proportional to the overall culpability of the offender: see <i>C.A.M.</i>,<i> </i>at para. 73. For this reason, trial judges retain discretion, even
    in terrorism cases, to impose lighter sentences in appropriate circumstances.
    That said<span class=GramE>,</span> it will be the rare case where lighter
    sentences are imposed on offenders who knowingly engage in terrorist activity
    that is designed to or is likely to result in the indiscriminate killing of
    innocent human beings. As indicated, in those cases, life sentences or
    sentences exceeding 20 years will generally be appropriate. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[222]<span

lang=EN-US>As we shall explain, there are many reasons why long fixed-term
    sentences exceeding 20 years may be warranted in terrorism cases. These include
    the horrific nature of the crime and the need to let would-be terrorists know
    that they will pay a heavy price if they choose to pursue their deadly
    activities in Canada.  Beyond those
    factors, there is much to be said for keeping those who have shown a
    willingness to engage in the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians under
    the aegis of the parole system, if not in prison, for well beyond 20 years. </span></p>

    would take only minor modifications to change that. There were several cases

    intended terrorists, resulted in explosive devices failing or in one or more
    instances blowing up prematurely such that the lives of innocent victims were

lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge stated that he did not regard the
    “amateurish” nature of the appellant’s efforts as mitigating the seriousness of
    his intent, there has been some suggestion that the trial judge treated the
    appellant’s lack of expertise as a mitigating factor: see, for example, <i>R. v. Khalid</i>, (September 3, 2009), Brampton,

    &amp; Pen. Div.)), at paras. 50 and 57. Hence, the need to provide
    clarification. (For a case in which the sentence was mitigated where the plot
    in question was “amateurish”, in the sense that the expected result “would never
    have occurred in practice”, see <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Barot</span></i>, [2007] EWCA Crim. 1119, at para. 29. We express

lang=EN-US>In this case, the RCMP seized the hifidigimonster device and a
    photograph showing a detonator device from the appellant’s home. According to
    Sergeant Fiset of the RCMP, the Crown’s expert on explosive devices, the seized
    device was non-functional as a triggering device for an IED due to a design
    flaw; however, with modifications, it could be made to function effectively. Sergeant
    Fiset also testified that the hifidigimonster as photographed was capable of

lang=EN-US>The fact that the detonator as seized may have required some minor modifications

    are caught in the preparatory stage may often appear to be amateurish; in those

    but amateurish. The characterization “amateurish” does not lessen the threat.  </span></p>

    sense motivated, as criminal activities so often are, by a need for financial
    gain or simply private revenge. Rather, an intolerant and inflexible

    the characteristics of terrorism that distinguish it from other crimes: “Terrorism

    likely to result in the loss of innocent lives, as is the case with the
    appellant, there can be little doubt that <span class=SpellE>Elomar</span> would have received a life sentence. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>In assessing the danger the appellant poses to society in this case,
    we have not ignored his submission that his goal was to kill western soldiers
    in Afghanistan and local troops that support them, not innocent civilians, and
    that his punishment should be mitigated accordingly. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[245]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We see no merit in that submission. His own writings belie it and
    the trial judge concluded that he cared not who his victims might be.  The appellant advocated the death of innocent
    human beings as the only way of achieving his goal of violent Jihad. Beyond
    that, we reject outright the notion that the lives of soldiers serving in
    Afghanistan should be somehow treated as “less worthy” of protection when
    fashioning appropriate sentences for terrorism-related offences under Part II.1
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>We have already explained why terrorism is a crime like no other.
    Once detected, it must be dealt with in the severest of terms. When terrorists
    acting on Canadian soil are apprehended and brought to justice, the
    responsibility lies with the courts to send a clear and unmistakable message
    that terrorism is reprehensible and those who choose to engage in it here will
    pay a very heavy price.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Our justice system is committed to the values of a democratic
    society, in which <span class=GramE>openness,</span> governmental
    accountability, individual freedoms and the rule of law are accepted as the
    cornerstones of a fair and just system of criminal justice.  Our sentencing and correctional philosophy
    also places a premium on the notion of individual dignity and it accepts
    redemption and rehabilitation as desired and achievable goals.  Regrettably, the hallmarks that define our
    justice system may be seen by those who reject democracy and individual freedom
    as signs of weakness. Terrorists, in particular, may view Canada as an
    attractive place from which to pursue their heinous activities. And it is up to
    the courts to shut the door on that way of thinking, swiftly and surely. </span></p>

    to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> this observation as a sad truism. <i>Moreover, terrorism is an increasing evil in

lang=EN-US>In <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Sakr</span></i> (1987), 31 A. Crim. R. 444, at p. 451, Crockett J., speaking for the Court of
    Criminal Appeal of Victoria, expressed similar thoughts on the need to stamp
    out terrorism quickly and decisively:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[Terrorism]
    is an offence that is callous in its conception, wanton in its perpetration
    and, if the intent is given effect to, ruthlessly destructive in its aftermath.
    It is a crime that is relatively novel in this country, as I have already
    indicated, and yet it is plain that there is <span class=GramE>a community</span> recognition that it is regarded with a particular repugnance because its
    commission represents a profound assault upon a stable society and the law and
    order that is necessary for that society’s survival. Those responsible for such
    reprehensible conduct must expect to suffer condign punishment.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If
    ever there were a case in which the nature of the offence and the circumstances
    of its commission, called for a deterrent penalty, then this is that case. The
    court is justified in believing that the community would expect that the
    punishment to be imposed should mark its intention, so far as it might be
    within the power of the court to do so, to arrest the incipient growth of
    terrorist-style criminal activity in this community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[250]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree with the sentiments expressed by Justices <span
class=SpellE>Whealy</span> and Crockett. Terrorism must not be allowed to take
    root in Canada. When it is detected, it must be dealt with in the severest of
    terms.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[251]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>With respect, the trial judge in the instant case did not give
    sufficient weight to this concern. Nor, as we have observed, did he adequately
    consider the unique nature of terrorism-related offences, the gravity of the
    appellant’s crimes, or the continuing risk that he poses to society now, and
    for the indefinite future.  In the result,
    he imposed a sentence that was manifestly unfit. The appellant should have been
    sentenced to life imprisonment, with an order under s. 743.6(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requiring that he serve at
    least 10 years before being eligible for release on full parole.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[252]<span

lang=EN-US>The appellant is now 31 years old. He is still a young man. If he truly
    reforms and renounces his commitment to violent Jihad by presenting clear
    evidence of his reformation to the satisfaction of the parole board, he will
    have the opportunity to live out a full and productive life in the community,
    albeit under the scrutiny of the parole system. If he does not reform, society
    will at least have the peace of mind of knowing that he will never again be in
    a position to pursue his deadly activities. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Conclusion on Sentence Appeals</span></a></h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[253]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We would grant the Crown’s application for leave to cross-appeal and
    increase the appellant’s sentence on count 1 to life imprisonment. Although the
    trial judge entered the conviction on count 1 on the included offence of “doing
    anything with intent to cause an explosion of an explosive substance” contrary
    to s. 81(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> – a
    non-terrorism-related offence – that offence also attracts a possible life
    sentence. As we have explained, the trial judge acquitted the appellant of the
    terrorism-related offences underlying counts 1 and 2 on a very narrow basis,
    namely, that he was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    knew he was assisting in the U.K. fertilizer bomb plot of the Khyam group, as
    alleged by the prosecution in connection with these counts.  The Crown did not appeal the acquittal on the
    terrorism-related offences in counts 1 and 2.  With that in mind, we are prepared to assume that the trial judge’s
    decision on this issue was correct. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[254]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Nonetheless, we are satisfied that the basis for the conviction on
    the underlying offence in count 1 was clearly connected to terrorist activity
    and thus properly triggers the sentencing principles we have articulated.  As noted by the trial judge at para. 4 of his
    reasons for sentence, the appellant’s activity in developing and possessing an
    explosive device “was directed at assisting his terrorist associates in a way
    that could only result in serious injury, death and destruction to people and
    property somewhere.”  Accordingly, even
    though the appellant was acquitted of the terrorism-related offence in count 1,
    on the trial judge’s findings, it is accurate to describe the underlying
    offence as a terrorist-related crime.  Pursuant
    to s.&nbsp;743.6(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    an order will go on count 1 requiring that the appellant serve 10 years before
    he may be released on full parole. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In light of the life sentence imposed on count 1, the sentences to
    be imposed on the remaining counts take on somewhat less significance. However,
    we would have regard to the following five factors in fashioning the sentence
    for the remaining counts: (1) the seriousness of the conduct underlying the
    counts as a whole; (2) the nature of the individual terrorism offences proved
    by the Crown; (3) the absence of evidence of the appellant’s rehabilitative
    prospects; (4) Parliament’s intent, reflected in s. 83.26 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, that the cumulative sentence
    for multiple terrorism-related crimes will be beyond the upper range imposed
    for other crimes; and (5) the overriding principle of proportionality.  Taking these factors into account, we would
    impose the following consecutive sentences on each remaining count, to be
    served concurrently with the life sentence imposed on count 1: </span></p>

    note that the logic of the trial judge’s finding would suggest that the
    entirety of Part II.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> should be struck down.  Commonsense would tell us that, if indeed there is a “chilling effect”
    as described by the trial judge, it is a product of the entire package of
    legislation, particularly the extensive investigative powers given to the
    authorities in respect of terrorism offences.  This would appear to be the view of Professor Webb, one of the authors
    relied on by the trial judge:  M. Webb, “<span
lang=EN-US>Essential Liberty or a Little
    Temporary Safety?  <span class=GramE>The
    Review of the Canadian Anti-terrorism Act” (2006) 51 Crim. L. Q. 53.</span></span></p>
