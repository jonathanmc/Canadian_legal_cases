  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises from a prolonged and bitter
    matrimonial proceeding.  The trial judge
    ordered the appellant to make an equalization payment to the respondent,
    dismissed the appellant’s claim for a constructive trust with respect to the
    respondent’s property, made a restraining order against the appellant, required
    that a vexatious litigant determination be made before the appellant could
    undertake any further litigation and awarded substantial indemnity costs
    against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was self-represented at trial.  He applies to admit the report of an
    audiologist as fresh evidence in support of his contention that he had a
    hearing impairment that interfered with his ability to understand the
    proceedings below and present his case.  That
    application, filed on the eve of this hearing, was linked to a last minute
    notice of constitutional question whereby the appellant sought to raise <i>Charter</i> issues related to his ability to
    present his case at trial, and which was not pursued in oral argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the material proffered as fresh evidence
    does not meet the test for admissibility and there is no merit in the <i>Charter</i> claims.  There is no affidavit to support the
    audiologist’s report and, in any event, that evidence does not meet the test for
    admissibility of fresh evidence.  Even if
    the other criteria for admissibility of fresh evidence were satisfied, this
    evidence would not affect the result.  There is nothing in the record or in the fresh evidence that persuades
    us that the appellant was denied a fair trial.  Our review of the record at trial satisfies us that any problem the
    appellant had in presenting his case was not the product of any hearing
    deficiency.  He appeared to hear
    everything that was said, he demonstrated a familiarity with legal proceedings
    and the trial judge endeavoured to assist him with explanations as to how to
    proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, who has considerable experience as a
    litigant, was strongly advised by a judge on a pre-trial motion to retain
    counsel for the trial.  He refused to
    follow that advice.  The trial judge made
    considerable efforts to explain the proceedings and the relevant rules.  The trial judge did not err in rulings made
    during the course of the appellant’s cross-examination of the respondent’s
    expert and the respondent.  The trial
    judge merely insisted that the cross-examinations focus on matters relevant to
    the issues raised and that the appellant respect the rules for the
    admissibility of evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s difficulties arose from the fact that he
    had no evidence to support the claims he was advancing that the gold mine, at
    the heart of the dispute over equalization, had a value of some $360 million
    and that he was the beneficiary of a constructive trust in relation to shares
    and property owned by the respondent.  The appellant has included in the appeal book material that was not
    tendered or admitted at trial as evidence.  Even if that material were to be considered, it does not support his
    exaggerated contention as to the value of the mining property or indeed any
    value of the shares as of valuation date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this record, we would not disturb the trial judge’s
    finding that the shares in KPM and KPM’s property had no value at valuation
    date.  However, it follows from that
    finding that the two receivables from KPM totalling $362,980 included in the
    appellant’s valuation date assets should be given no value.  If the company had no value, it was highly
    unlikely that the receivables were collectable.  The equalization payment ordered should be adjusted accordingly and
    reduced by $181,490 from the $225,840 that, but for a mathematical error, the
    trial judge should have ordered.  This
    yields an equalization award of $44,350. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The agreed statement of facts identifying the issues to
    be tried did not mention a request for a restraining order or an order
    qualifying the appellant’s right to bring further proceedings.  Accordingly, we would strike paragraphs 3 and
    6 of the judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we would not interfere with the trial judge’s
    order as to the costs of trial.  With
    respect to the costs of the appeal, we award $10,000 to the respondent
    inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
