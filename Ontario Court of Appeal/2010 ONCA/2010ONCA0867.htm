  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises out of a dispute over which level of
    government, if any, is responsible for the maintenance of two roads near the
    town of Sioux Lookout.  One road leads to
    the Lac Seul First Nation (LSFN) Reserve and the other leads to the Pelican
    Falls Centre, a high school and residence for First Nations students. Until
    1998, the territory on which the roads are located was not under the
    jurisdiction of any organized municipality and the roads were maintained by
    Ontario pursuant to cost-sharing agreements with LSFN and the respondent
    Northern Nishnawbe Educational Council (NNEC), the entity that operates the
    Pelican Falls Centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 1, 1998, the appellant Municipality of Sioux
    Lookout (“Sioux Lookout”) was expanded by the restructuring order of a
    commission under the <i>Municipal Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, to include a large territory that includes the roads at
    issue in this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sioux Lookout applied for a declaration that it did not
    become responsible for these roads as a result of the restructuring order, and
    that it has no present responsibility for their maintenance.  NNEC applied for a declaration that the
    Pelican Falls Road lies within the jurisdiction of Sioux Lookout and that Sioux
    Lookout is responsible for its maintenance and raised certain constitutional
    issues. The two applications were consolidated.  Pursuant to a case management order, the issues to be determined on the
    hearing of the application were narrowed to: (1) whether any of the roads <span
class=GramE>are ,</span> or have been a municipal highway since January 1,
    1998, and if so, (2) whether Sioux Lookout is under a duty to repair and
    maintain any or both of them.  This
    agreement to limit the issues was without prejudice to NNEC and LSFN’s right to
    advance claims for maintenance and repair against Ontario and Canada in a
    subsequent proceeding.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Lac Seul Road is approximately 8.45 km long and has
    two components.  The Goodie Lake Road
    component runs from the Mill Road to the Frenchman’s Head Road.  The Frenchman’s Head Road component runs from
    the Goodie Lake Road to the boundary of the Lac Seul First Nation Reserve.  The Goodie Lake Road was built by the
    province on provincial Crown land in the 1960s.  It was designated as a public forest road under s. 53 of the <i>Public Lands Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 380
    (now s. 51 of the <i>Public Lands Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 43) in 1974.  The
    Frenchman’s Head Road was built by the province on provincial Crown land in the
    late 1970s.  The Lac Seul Road is the
    only means of road access to the Lac Seul First Nation Reserve.  The public has enjoyed an uninterrupted right
    of passage over the Frenchman’s Head Road and the Goodie Lake Road since each
    was built.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Pelican Falls Road, approximately 6.5 km long,
    starts at Provincial Highway 664.  It
    runs north past the Radar Base Road, across a CN Railway line, and continues
    toward the Pelican Falls Centre operated by the respondent NNEC.  The road was built by the federal government,
    but the land south of the railway is provincial Crown land.  The province granted the federal government a
    licence of occupation under the <i>Public
    Lands Act</i> for the portion between the Radar Base Road and the railway in
    1946.  A similar licence was granted for
    the portion between Highway 664 and the Radar Base Road in 1949.  While the latter licence was cancelled in
    1968, the former licence remains in effect.  The road is the only means of road access to the Pelican Falls Centre
    from Sioux Lookout. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The public has had access to all of these roads since
    they were built.  The Frenchman’s Head
    Road and the Pelican Falls Road are roads under the <i>Public Lands Act</i>, and the Goodie Lake Road is a public forest road
    under the same Act.  For many years prior
    to 1998, the roads were maintained by the Ministry of Transportation (MTO)
    pursuant to cost-sharing agreements under s. 90 of the <i>Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    P.50.  The costs for the Lac Seul Road
    were evenly shared between the MTO and LSFN, and those for the Pelican Falls
    Road evenly shared between the MTO and NNEC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Restructuring Order under the <i>Municipal Act</i> was issued on June 30, 1997 and took effect on
    January 1, 1998.  The accompanying report
    of the restructuring Commissioner explicitly acknowledged that he had no
    authority over the funding of provincial highways and their potential
    assumption by Sioux Lookout.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario took the position that from January 1, 1998,
    the roads came under municipal jurisdiction.  The MTO repeatedly stated that it would not be responsible for the roads
    after the restructuring, and proceeded to terminate its cost-sharing
    arrangements as s. 90 of the <i>Public
    Transportation and Highway Improvement Act</i> only provides for cost-sharing
    for roads in territory without municipal organization.  However, Ontario did not transfer the roads
    to Sioux Lookout pursuant to the statutory mechanisms available to accomplish
    that objective in the <i>Municipal Act</i> and the <i>Public Transportation and Highway
    Improvement Act</i>.  Sioux Lookout disputed
    any obligation on it to maintain the roads and did not pass any bylaw or
    resolution to assume the roads, but spent approximately $750,000 on maintenance
    of the roads between January 1998 and October 2007.  It stopped this maintenance as of November 1,
    2007 and this litigation ensued.  The
    roads are currently in a state of serious disrepair. </p>

    BEFORE THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Positions of the Parties</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of the case management order, the only
    issue before the application judge was whether the roads had become municipal
    highways and, if so, whether Sioux Lookout had the duty to maintain and repair
    them.  Sioux Lookout took the position
    that the answer to both questions was no, while NNEC and LSFN submitted that
    the answer was yes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario’s initial position, as set out in its factum
    filed for argument of the application, was that Sioux Lookout’s application
    should be dismissed.  However, at the
    case management meeting and during oral argument, Ontario changed its
    position.  Ontario asked the application
    judge to grant Sioux Lookout’s application, hold that the roads were never
    dedicated and that, apart from portions of the Pelican Falls Road that fall
    under Canada’s authority, the roads were <i>Public
    Lands Act</i> roads.  Ontario maintained,
    however, that as these are roads under the <i>Public
    Lands Act</i>, Ontario was not responsible for their maintenance.  As I will explain below, before this court
    Ontario again changed its position and it now asks this court to uphold the
    judgment of the application judge.  Canada’s submissions were restricted to the status of portions of the
    Pelican Falls Road as against the province and accordingly were not, and Canada
    maintains ought not to have been, dealt with by the application judge.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Judgment of the Application Judge</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that both roads became municipal
    highways as of January 1, 1998, and that Sioux Lookout was under a duty to
    repair and maintain them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge based her conclusion on the
    common law doctrine of dedication and acceptance, described at para. 32 of her
    reasons as “a common law principle that involves the transfer of land from a
    private owner or the Crown to facilitate creation of a public highway”.  While the <i>Municipal
    Act, 2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c. 25, s. 31 now provides that land can only become a
    highway if a municipality passes a by-law to that effect, this case fell to be
    decided according to the law as it stood in 1998, when no similar provision
    existed in the <i>Municipal Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found first that there had been
    “dedication by legislative enactment”.  She
    found that the history of the roads established that they were accepted by
    public use, and that permission for the public to use the roads flowed from the <i>Public Lands Act</i>, s. 49, which
    provides that “any person may exercise a public right of passage on a road [on
    public lands] other than a private forest road.”  She found, at paras. 59-60, that ss. 262 and
    263 of the <i>Municipal Act</i> “operate as
    dedication by provincial legislative enactment that took effect upon
    annexation.”  She added, at para. 60,
    that while the roads were public forest <span class=GramE>roads under the <i>Public Lands Act</i>, that status was</span> inconsistent “with the scheme of legislative dedication under the <i>Municipal Act</i>.”  The application judge made no reference to s.
    258(2), which provides that the Part of the Act including ss. 262 and 263 “does not apply to a provincial road or
    bridge under the control of the Crown” absent a specific declaration by the
    Lieutenant Governor in Council pursuant to s. 272. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As an alternative basis for finding dedication, the
    application judge found that dedication occurred by the province’s
    conduct.  There was extensive documentary
    evidence that the MTO consistently represented that Sioux Lookout, and not the
    MTO, would be responsible for the roads after the restructuring.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acceptance was evidenced by Sioux Lookout’s expenditure
    of approximately $750,000 to maintain the roads between 1998 and 2007, as well
    as its written communications.  On this
    basis, she held that the roads had been municipal highways since January 1,
    1998.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge applied s. 284 of the <i>Municipal Act</i> and s. 44(1) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i> in determining that
    Sioux Lookout has a duty to repair and maintain the roads.</p>

    application judge erred in her interpretation of the legislation and that in
    view of the express terms of s. 258(2), ss. 262 and 263 of the <i>Municipal Act</i> do not apply.  It also argues that the hearing below was
    unfair because of restrictions imposed on its reply argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario agrees with Sioux Lookout that the application

    Ontario submits that her application of the common law doctrine of dedication
    and acceptance by virtue of the conduct of Ontario and Sioux Lookout is
    correct.  </p>

    pointed out, s. 258(2) provides that the Part of the Act that includes ss. 262 and
    263 “does not apply to a
    provincial road or bridge under the control of the Crown” absent a specific
    declaration by the Lieutenant Governor in Council pursuant to s. 272.  There was no such declaration and it therefore
    follows that ss. 262 and 263, the sections the application judge applied to
    sustain her theory of “dedication by statute”, have no application on the facts
    of this case.</p>

    the Crown” for the purpose of s. 258(2).  In my view, that submission must be rejected.  It begs the very question to be decided: the
    issue is whether ss. 262 and 263 take the roads at issue from their status as
    provincial roads to a new status as municipal highways.  That question cannot be answered by assuming that
    the roads are already municipal highways. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The common law doctrine of dedication and acceptance is
    a mechanism by which a passage over private land becomes a public highway and
    title is transferred from the owner to a municipality: see W.D. (Rusty)
    Russell, <i>Russell on Roads</i>, 2d ed.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court in <i>Broslaw v. North York (City) </i>(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 458 at p. 463 (C.A.)
    adopted the statement from <i>Tait v.
    McKellar (Township)</i>, [1951] O.R. 226 at p. 239 (C.A.):  “The question whether land has been dedicated
    by the owner thereof for use as a public highway is one of fact, and dedication
    must not be too readily presumed”.  Unobstructed use by the public over a substantial period of time is
    evidence from which an intention to dedicate may be inferred:<i> O’Neil v. Harper</i> (1913), 28 O.L.R. 635
    at p. 644 (C.A.);<i> Broslaw</i> at p. 463; <i>Reed v. Lincoln (Town)</i> (1975), 6 O.R.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While dedication is usually by a private owner, there
    is nothing inherent to the doctrine that prevents it from applying to land
    owned by the Crown, subject of course to relevant legislation.  As this court stated in <i>O’Neil </i>at pp. 644-645: “[t]he Crown certainly may dedicate a road
    to the public....The presumption of dedication may be made where the land belongs
    to the Crown or to a private owner”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I conclude that the doctrine

    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application of the doctrine of dedication and
    acceptance to roads under the <i>Public
    Lands Act</i> was considered in <i>Clark v.
    North Kawartha (Township)</i> (2009), 69 M.P.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 146 (Ont.
    S.C.), aff’d (2010), 67 M.P.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 67 (Ont. C.A.).  Gunsolus J. held, at para. <span class=GramE>53,
    that</span> the common law doctrine cannot apply to a road governed by the <i>Public Lands Act</i>.  Section 49 of the <i>Public Lands Act</i>, quoted above, explicitly provides the public with
    access to roads on public lands.  Gunsolus J. held, at para. 45, that as the public already enjoys a
    legally protected right of passage, it is not possible to infer dedication from
    public use: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While an intention to
    dedicate a road may sometimes be inferred from evidence of use by the public,
    in this case such an inference cannot be made. The public clearly enjoyed and
    continues to enjoy use of the Road in question pursuant to the legislated
    permission as set out in s. 49 of the <i>Public Lands Act</i>.... Since public
    use of this Road is specifically provided for in the Act, mere use by the
    public cannot, by itself, be sufficient to infer an intention to dedicate the
    Road in question, in this case by the Province of Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court upheld that judgment on appeal on the ground
    that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis for the factual findings that
    there had been no dedication or acceptance.  It did not address the applicability of
    dedication and acceptance to <i>Public Lands
    Act</i> roads.  However, I agree with the
    holding in <i>Clark </i>that public use
    cannot be evidence of an intention to dedicate a road under the <i>Public Lands Act</i> as the public already enjoys
    the right of access by virtue of the statute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also important to observe that there are clear
    statutory mechanisms by which the province can transfer a <i>Public Lands Act </i>road to a municipality.  Under s. 29(4) of the <i>Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act</i>, the Lieutenant
    Governor in Council may transfer any part of any highway under the control of
    the Ministry of Transportation to any municipality in which it is situate.  A similar mechanism was available in 1998 under
    s. 272 of the now-repealed <i>Municipal Act</i>.
     While the road in question would first
    have to be transferred from the Ministry of Natural Resources to the Ministry
    of Transportation, this could have been accomplished by the Minister of
    Transportation under s. 5 of the <i>Public Transportation
    and Highway Improvement Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The failure to use the statutory mechanisms specifically
    designed to achieve a transfer of responsibility from the province to a
    municipality is telling.  The law
    provided a clear statutory mechanism to accomplish the assignment of
    responsibility for the roads to Sioux Lookout.  In my view, in the face of Ontario’s failure to take the steps clearly
    spelled out in the legislation, it was an error of law to infer an intention to
    transfer the roads to municipal jurisdiction and responsibility through a
    strained interpretation of the common law doctrine of dedication and
    acceptance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of my conclusion on the issue of dedication, it
    is not necessary to consider the question of whether Sioux Lookout “accepted” the
    purported dedication.  As the conclusion
    on dedication resolves the appeal in Sioux Lookout’s favour, it is also not
    necessary to address the municipality’s submissions that the hearing below was
    unfair and that the Province’s position on this appeal is inconsistent with
    representations and agreements made at the case management meeting.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;'>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the Province had
    dedicated the roads by statute, specifically ss. 262 and 263 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, or by dedication at common
    law through its conduct.  Section 258(2)
    explicitly provides that Part XVII, which includes ss. 262 and 263, “does not
    apply to a provincial road or bridge under the control of the Crown.”  Accordingly, the application judge erred in
    finding “dedication by legislative enactment”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge correctly found that the roads
    were roads under the <i>Public Lands Act</i>.  There was no room for the common law doctrine
    to apply to accomplish dedication as evidenced by public use as the public
    already enjoyed a statutory right of passage over the roads.  Moreover, as the province failed to take the
    steps spelled out in legislation to transfer responsibility for the roads to
    the municipality, it was an error to infer from the province’s conduct an
    intention to dedicate, thereby triggering the application of the common law
    doctrine of dedication and acceptance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize that my decision leaves the important issue
    of who is responsible for the maintenance of these roads unresolved.  While we are restricted to deciding the case
    on the legal principles that apply to the specific issues raised on the appeal,
    the need for an immediate solution, be it legal, political or some combination
    of the two, is obvious and I would urge the parties to make every effort to find
    that solution as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would allow Sioux Lookout’s
    appeal, set aside the judgment of the application judge, grant Sioux Lookout’s
    request for a declaration that the roads are not municipal roads or highways and
    that Sioux Lookout is not responsible for their maintenance, and dismiss NNEC’s
    application for a declaration to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I would set aside the application judge’s judgment

    Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties may make brief written submissions as to
