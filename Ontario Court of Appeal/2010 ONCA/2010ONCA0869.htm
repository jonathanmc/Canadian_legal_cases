  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the evening of June 6, 2003, Raheel Malik was attacked by a group of young men
    in the parking lot of the Albion Mall in the Rexdale area of Toronto.  He was hit on the head with various weapons
    including a hammer, a wooden “two-by-four” and possibly a metal pipe.  The attack was over in less than a minute.  Following the assault, Malik lapsed into a
    coma.  He never regained consciousness,
    and died of pneumonia in hospital 20 days later.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Events leading up to the
    attack</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Malik
    was associated with a group of young South Asian men from Rexdale and Banwait
    with a similar group from Mississauga.  The two groups had a history of conflict, and in the months leading up
    to the attack, Malik and the appellant Banwait developed some form of personal “beef”.  In the week before Malik’s death, Banwait had
    been attempting to locate Malik and the two apparently had an altercation at
    Malik’s place of work a day or two before the attack.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The day of the attack</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Banwait
    arranged for a group of young men to gather at “Mac’s Plaza” in
    Mississauga.  The appellant Matharu was one
    of the men that Banwait called.  Matharu
    showed up at the plaza in a car driven by his friend Gurpreet Bath.  Banwait took over as driver and left the
    plaza. The group followed in a convoy.  Matharu was in the backseat along with another young woman.  While driving, Banwait borrowed Bath’s cell
    phone and called Malik.  The two
    exchanged angry words and agreed to meet at the Albion Mall.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
    he received the call from Banwait, Malik was out with three friends.    After the telephone conversation, Malik made
    his way to the Albion Mall.  However, he
    stopped at a Rexdale home along the way to recruit some people to join him.  They refused.  Malik then drove to Albion Mall with his three passengers in tow.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Banwait’s
    sister, Daljit, had lived in Rexdale for a couple of years and was present at
    the Rexdale home when Malik tried to enlist some supporters. Another person at the
    home heard Malik say things like, “I’m gonna like kill him” and “I’m gonna go
    myself and finish this business”. Fearing for her brother’s safety, Daljit quickly
    borrowed a car and headed for the Albion Mall before Malik left the house.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The events at Albion Mall</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    and his friends arrived at the mall before Malik, at about 9:30 p.m.  Most of the group parked near the northern
    exit of the mall, though others parked a little to the west.  Banwait, Matharu and two other young men went
    to look for Malik in the pool hall.  Not
    finding him there, they went back outside and the two other young men returned
    to their car. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    and Matharu approached two men near the cinema entrance, Mutti-Ur Rehman and Hammad
    Khan. They were joined shortly by Hammad’s brother, Azzm Khan.  Banwait asked the group (all of whom were
    friends with Malik) if they knew a short guy who worked as a security guard at
    the mall. The three men immediately recognized this man as Malik. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    some point during this discussion, Daljit Banwait arrived and asked her brother
    what he was doing. He said he was waiting for the security guard to arrive and
    that he had 25 to 30 men parked in the parking lot, in case something happened. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Just
    as Rehman attempted to reach Malik by cell phone to warn him, Malik drove into
    the parking lot and stopped his car near Banwait and Matharu. Malik got out of
    his car, telling his passengers to stay in the car and lock the doors.  He and Banwait began to yell at one
    another.  Banwait and Matharu gestured
    for the group waiting across the parking lot to approach, yelling “come,
    come”.  The group ran across the parking
    lot towards Malik.  Many carried weapons.  Banwait pulled out a hammer from his clothing
    and Matharu pulled out a pipe.  Malik
    backed away from them but was struck on the back of the head with a two-by-four
    by someone in the approaching group.  Banwait then hit Malik on the jaw with the hammer.  There was some evidence that Matharu hit
    Malik with his pipe, though Matharu maintained that he only kicked him. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    evidence concerning how many further blows were struck and by whom was
    conflicting. Suffice it to say that Malik was surrounded and brutally beaten to
    the point of unconsciousness in under a minute. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    group dispersed quickly and ran back to their cars. Banwait remained, shattering
    the windows of Malik’s car with his hammer before returning to Bath’s car. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Malik
    suffered three main head injuries, including fatal skull fractures to the side
    and back of the head.  The forensic
    evidence was that the injury to the temple was likely caused by a hammer blow, and
    the injury to the back of the head was the result of a blunt instrument.  Malik’s third non-fatal head injury was a
    fracture to the left jaw, also caused by a blunt instrument.  He had no other significant injuries.</span></p>

    responded to phone calls, telling everyone to meet at Country Style
    Donuts.  According to witnesses, Banwait
    was rowdy and hyper at the donut shop and he told his sister that he had spoken
    to his father about sending him to India.  Soon after their arrival, Matharu left the donut shop.</span></p>

    armed with a pipe. He claimed he just waved the pipe at Malik but acknowledged
    kicking him hard a couple of times in the body. A third man, Amar Gurpreet
    Sandhu, was arrested several weeks later. </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of the three accused called evidence at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thrust of the Crown’s theory, as expressed in the
    closing address, was that the three accused, along with others, concocted a
    plan to kill Malik to exact revenge. According to the Crown, the evidence at
    trial established that the group hunted Malik down; lured him to the Albion
    Mall where they lay in wait for him; surrounded him when he got out of his car
    alone and unarmed; beat him mercilessly about the head in a carefully executed
    manner with dangerous weapons; and then left him lying in a parking lot, unconscious
    and bleeding, to die. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Banwait’s counsel challenged causation and
    therefore did not admit any degree of liability, in his closing address he acknowledged,
    on behalf of his client, the following level of participation: being present at
    the Albion Mall on the evening of the attack; trying to contact Malik
    beforehand; arranging for some people to be with him at the Albion Mall “in
    case something happened”; arguing with Malik before the fight; hitting Malik
    once with the hammer; smashing the car windows; and becoming panicky, fleeing
    from the scene, disposing of the hammer and telling a friend that he hurt
    Malik. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Banwait’s counsel disputed the Crown’s claim
    that Banwait intended to kill Malik and vigorously disputed the Crown’s claim
    that Banwait planned and deliberated a murder. According to Banwait’s counsel,
    the planning and deliberation was for nothing more than a gang fight.</p>
  <h4> <span lang=EN-US>           (b) The trial judge’s instructions on
    the routes to first degree murder</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his final instructions, the trial judge left with the
    jury the option of finding each accused guilty of a planned and deliberate
    murder (s. 231(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>)
    under either s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i) (means to cause death) or s.
    229(a)(ii) (means to cause bodily harm knowing it is likely to cause death and being

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the verdicts against Matharu and Sandhu, the
    jury must have rejected the Crown’s theory of a joint plan to murder Malik and
    almost certainly rejected the Crown’s theory that it was Sandhu who hit Malik
    over the head with the two-by-four when the attack began. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (d)
    Banwait’s position on appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Banwait submits that the Crown’s theory that
    the evidence gave rise to an inference of a planned and deliberate murder makes
    no sense and ignores powerful and unchallenged evidence pointing to a plan for
    a gang fight that got out of control. In particular, Banwait relies on the following
    evidence and available inferences:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>planning a murder in a public venue like the
    parking lot of a shopping mall with good lighting, security cameras and the
    likelihood of bystanders makes little sense;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the fact that Banwait had no way of controlling
    exactly when or where Malik would arrive and no way of predicting that he would
    arrive alone and unarmed is inconsistent with the suggestion of a planned and
    deliberate murder;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although there was a history of hostilities
    between the two groups, no evidence was called demonstrating a motive for
    murder—similarly, unlike the situation with Malik, no evidence was called
    suggesting that Banwait, or anyone in his group, expressed an intent to kill
    anyone;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the history of confrontation between the two
    groups, the evidence that Banwait talked about going to get “these guys” while
    en route to the mall, as well as the evidence that Malik attempted to recruit
    supporters before going to the mall suggest that all participants expected a
    group encounter;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Banwait’s conduct at the mall belies the
    suggestion of a planned and deliberate murder—after they first arrived at the
    mall, he and Matharu went downstairs on their own at the pool hall to look for
    Malik, leaving their two companions upstairs–in addition, Banwait gave his
    first name and the general location of his residence when talking to the group
    of three young men at the cinema entrance; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Banwait’s conduct before and after the attack is
    inconsistent with a planned and deliberate murder—he had not obtained the keys
    to the car he arrived in before going to look for Malik and therefore had no
    clear plan for escape; and the fact that he did not talk to his father about
    going to India until after the attack also undermines the suggestion of a
    planned event.</p>

    Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I agree the jury would have been justified in concluding
    that the tragic events of June 6, 2003, reflected a plan for a gang fight that later
    got out of hand, I am also satisfied that it was open to the jury to conclude
    that Banwait was guilty of a planned and deliberate murder taking account of
    the following evidence and available inferences:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in the week leading up to the attack, Banwait

    worked; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>after obtaining this information, Banwait went
    to Malik’s place of employment accompanied by two friends and engaged in a
    confrontation;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>within a day or two of the workplace
    confrontation, Banwait organized a much larger armed group to accompany him to
    Rexdale for a further confrontation; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Banwait started organizing the armed group hours
    before the attack;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although some of the evidence had Banwait
    speaking of getting “these guys”, other evidence referred to him as speaking of
    going to see “the Rexdale guy”;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an inference could be drawn that Banwait
    contacted Malik and arranged their meeting in a manner that would limit Malik’s
    ability to organize and recruit supporters for himself–although he had a cell
    phone, Banwait borrowed Bath’s cell phone that had a caller identification
    blocking feature to call Malik, thus increasing the likelihood that Malik would
    take the call; further, Banwait made the telephone call only after his group
    was at or close to Rexdale;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although the evidence about Banwait’s
    conversation with Malik was conflicting and somewhat ambiguous, one possible  inference was that Banwait chose the location
    for the confrontation;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the assault itself could be viewed as a well
    co-ordinated attack initiated on Banwait’s signal after Malik arrived and got
    out of his car—Banwait and Matharu began approaching Malik while signalling and
    calling to their supporters to join them; Malik was originally struck from the
    rear as Banwait and Matharu produced their weapons; within seconds, Banwait and
    his group surrounded Malik, crushed his skull and left him for dead;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the speed of the attack was demonstrated by the
    security cameras – Malik lay fatally injured within a minute of his arrival;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all of Malik’s injuries were to his head, he had
    no other significant injuries; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all of Malik’s head injuries were caused by blunt
    force weapons applied with considerable force;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although the three men at the entrance indicated
    they were friends of Malik and made some efforts to impede the attackers, none
    of them was harmed and none of the passengers in Malik’s car was harmed;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an inference could be drawn that Banwait was
    celebrating following the attack—at the Country Style venue, Banwait was
    observed thanking people as they left, shaking hands and exchanging shoulder
    bumps–to at least one witness, he appeared rowdy and hyper, making statements
    along the lines of: “We got him. He’s gone….Oh, he is dead. He’s dead….We
    fucked him up; we fucked him up.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly in the light of the organized nature of
    the attack, the potential inference that it was planned in a way that would
    limit Malik’s ability to recruit supporters for himself, the speed and
    intensity of the blows administered exclusively to Malik’s head and the failure
    to harm any of Malik’s friends, in the context of all the factors outlined
    above, in my view, it was open to the jury to return a verdict of first degree
    murder against Banwait.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Was the jury properly instructed on the
    relationship between planning and deliberation and murder, as defined under s.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the trial judge left with the jury the
    option of finding each accused guilty of a planned and deliberate murder under
    either s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i) or s. 229(a)(ii)of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Those sections read as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>229.  Culpable homicide is murder</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>where</span> the person who
    causes the death of a human being</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>       (i)               <span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>       (ii) <span

    cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banwait argues that it is possible, on the facts of
    this case, that the jury reached second degree murder by concluding that, even
    though the principals in the attack were not planning to kill Malik, they inevitably
    realized, during the course of their attack, that the injuries they were
    inflicting would likely cause death, even though they did not originally intend
    to kill him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account of this possibility, Banwait submits the
    trial judge’s instructions on the interrelationship between planning and
    deliberation and s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) were not sufficient.
    These instructions failed to make it clear to the jury that, even though they
    were satisfied Banwait had murdered Malik, in order to return a verdict of
    first degree murder, they had to be satisfied not only that he planned and
    deliberated causing bodily harm to Malik that would likely cause death, but also
    that he actually recognized, <i>in advance
    of the attack</i>, that Malik would likely die from his injuries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essence of this ground of appeal is an attack on
    the adequacy of the jury instructions.  However,
    because it appears that counsel and the trial judge did not share the same
    views about whether the strength of the Crown’s case for first degree murder arose
    under ss. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i) or (ii), or whether the Crown was even
    relying on s. 229(a)(ii), I will also review what emerges from the record about
    those subjects. </p>

    8, 2005, when counsel for all three accused elected not to call evidence.
    Pre-charge discussions began on Monday, December 12, 2005. During the course of
    these discussions it became clear that counsel for Sandhu and the trial judge
    perceived the essence of the Crown’s case as being a s.&nbsp;229(a)(ii) case,
    at least in relation to planning and deliberation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Sandhu’s

    and deliberate murder <i>in the sense of
    planned and deliberate to inflict serious bodily harm that was likely to cause
    death</i>.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the defence called no evidence, the Crown
    addressed the jury first. In his closing address, Crown counsel characterized
    the attack as a planned and deliberate mission agreed upon by all three
    defendants to kill Malik. He made no reference in his address to a plan to
    cause bodily harm, knowing the bodily harm is likely to cause death and being
    reckless whether death ensues. </p>

    came to relying on s. 229(a)(ii) were the following comments made at different
    points in the address:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The next stop with his convoy was a gas station
    where Jason Noronha told you that he saw a rowdy and hyper Mr. Banwait, and he
    heard him say, or yell, “We’re going to get these guys. We’re going to fuck them
    up.” </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is very important evidence for you to
    consider. Mr.&nbsp;Banwait clearly stated the group’s plan and their intent
    before they arrived at the mall.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>

    days. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After describing the general legal principles

    the offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He gave the jury an overview of the homicide provisions
    in the <i>Criminal Code</i> in the classic
    way: by going “up the ladder” from homicide to culpable homicide; by
    distinguishing murder from manslaughter based on the mental element for murder;
    and by distinguishing first degree murder from second degree murder by
    describing a first degree murder as a murder that is planned and deliberate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he did not refer to the section numbers of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the trial judge
    described the necessary mental element for murder in terms of both s. 229(a<span

    229(a)(ii), which he described as an intent to cause serious injuries knowing they

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And again, in the classic way, it was only after
    describing the two possible mental elements for murder that the trial judge distinguished
    a first degree murder (under s.&nbsp;231(2)) from a second degree murder by
    describing a first degree murder as a murder that is planned and deliberate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to the elements of the offence to be
    proven against each accused, the trial judge described the liability of parties
    to an offence and provided the jury with an “Overview of the Case”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In describing the case for the Crown in his “Overview”,
    the trial judge focused exclusively on section 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).
    He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The case for the Crown is that Mr. Banwait, Mr.
    Matharu and Mr. Sandhu <i>agreed to cause
    serious injuries to Raheel Malik that they knew would likely kill him, not
    caring whether or not he died</i>. This agreement was the result of a plan, for
    the most part, by Mr. Banwait joined by Mr. Matharu and Mr.&nbsp;Sandhu at
    critical stages of its implementation on June 6, 2003. It was deliberately
    carried out, efficiently and brutally. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to each accused, the trial judge then gave
    the jury instructions concerning causation, identity as a principal, murder as
    a principal, first degree murder as a principal, identity as an aider or
    abettor, murder as an aider or abettor, first degree murder as an aider or
    abettor, and manslaughter as either a principal or as an aider or abettor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Starting with Banwait, the trial judge went through
    each of the elements to be proven by the Crown in detail. In dealing with the
    mental element for murder as a principal, he essentially repeated his earlier
    short form summary, again without referring to section numbers. He then
    provided the following, more detailed instruction in which he referred to the
    mental element described in both s. 229(a)(i) and s. 229(a)(ii):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The crime of murder requires proof of a particular
    state of mind. For an unlawful killing to be murder, the Crown must prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Banwait meant either to kill Raheel Malik or
    meant to cause serious injuries to Raheel Malik that Mr. Banwait <b>knew</b> would likely kill Raheel Malik,
    and went ahead anyway, not caring whether Raheel Malik died. Crown does <b>not</b> have to prove <b>both</b>. One is enough. All of you do <b>not</b> have to agree on the same state of mind, as long as everyone is
    sure that one of the required states of mind has been proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in the original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After some further instructions, the trial judge set
    out the positions of the parties on the mental element for murder. The trial
    judge indicated the Crown took the position that “there is an abundance of
    evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt <i>either</i> of the states of mind required to commit the offence of
    murder.” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing Banwait’s position, the trial judge
    turned to the issue of first degree murder. Following an introduction, in which
    he repeated his short form summary of the mental element required for murder
    (either an intent to cause death or an intent to cause serious injuries knowing
    they are likely to cause death and not caring whether death ensues), he defined
    a first degree murder as a murder that is both planned and deliberate,
    emphasizing that “[i]t is <b>murder</b> itself that must be both planned and deliberate” and also that “[t]he planning
    and deliberation must be for a ‘murder’ and not merely for a fight.” [Emphasis
    in original].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The full text of the impugned portion of his instruction

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'>Let me now deal with

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Not every murder is first degree murder. To prove

    first degree murder, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only

    and deliberate. It is <b>not</b> enough for
    the Crown to prove that the “murder” was planned, or that the murder was
    deliberate. In order to establish that the “murder” of Mr. Malik was first
    degree murder, the Crown must prove both planning and deliberation beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is <b>murder</b> itself that must be both planned and deliberate, <b>not</b> something else that Mr. Banwait did or said. The planning and
    deliberation must be for a “murder” and not merely for a fight. <span

    deliberation, the trial judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A <b>planned</b> murder is one that is committed as a result of a scheme or plan that has been
    previously formulated or designed. It is the implementation of that scheme or
    design. A “murder” committed on a sudden impulse and without prior consideration,
    even with an intention to kill is <b>not</b> a planned murder.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A deliberate act is one that the actor has taken
    time to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of. The deliberation must take
    place <b>before</b> the act of <span
class=GramE>murder, that</span> is, before the verbal confrontation with the
    deceased at the Albion Mall started. A murder committed on a sudden impulse and
    without prior consideration, even with an intention to kill is <b>not</b> a deliberate murder. <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The trial judge then
    set out the position of the Crown and the position of Banwait on this issue. In
    describing the position of the Crown, the trial judge accurately recounted the
    Crown’s position, which focused solely on s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i).</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (d) Objections
    to the charge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the completion of the trial judge’s
    instructions to the jury, counsel for Banwait objected to the trial judge’s
    leaving s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii)<i> </i>with the jury. He said it appeared to him from the Crown’s closing
    that the theory of the Crown was that the three accused formed the intent to
    kill Malik from the outset and he addressed the jury “in a certain way” as a
    result. Although he acknowledged that s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) might
    be another way of proving the intent for murder, he suggested that it was
    inappropriate to leave that theory with the jury if the Crown was not relying
    on it. Counsel for Banwait did not object to the form of instructions given
    concerning s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) and planning and
    deliberation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge declined to change his characterization
    of the Crown’s position. Although he acknowledged that the focus of the Crown’s
    closing was on s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, he said he understood that
    the Crown was also relying on s. 229(a)(ii) and that it was his recollection
    that Crown counsel referred to both sections in his closing.</p>
  <h4> <span lang=EN-US>           (e) Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banwait submits that the trial judge’s instructions
    failed to make it clear to the jury that even if they were satisfied Banwait
    murdered Malik, in order to return a verdict of first degree murder under ss.
    231(2) and 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), they also had to be satisfied that
    he actually recognized, <i>in advance of the
    attack</i>, that Malik would likely die from his injuries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put another way, Banwait contends that the trial judge
    failed to adequately caution the jury against jumping to a conclusion of first
    degree murder based on how the attack unfolded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the particular circumstances of this case, I would accept
    this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mental element for murder under s. 229(a)(ii) contains
    three components: (1) subjective intent to cause bodily harm; (2) subjective
    knowledge that the bodily harm is of such a nature that it is likely to result
    in death; and (3) recklessness as to whether death ensues: <i>R. v. Nygaard</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1074, at pp. 1087-88; <i>R. v. Moo</i> (2010), 247 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Ont.
    C.A.), at para. 45. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, the central component of the mental element
    is “that of intending to cause bodily harm of such a grave and serious nature
    that the accused knew that it <span class=GramE>was  likely</span> to result in the death of the
    victim.  The aspect of recklessness is
    almost an afterthought in so far as the basic intent is concerned”: <i>Nygaard</i>, at p. 1088; see also <i>R. v. Cooper</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at pp.
    154-55, which describes the mental element in s.&nbsp;229(a)(ii) as having two
    aspects because of this statement in <i>Nygaard</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that the intent described in s.
    229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) can form the basis for a planned and
    deliberate murder under s. 231(2): <i>Nygaard</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that where the Crown alleges a planned and
    deliberate murder under s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), the requirement
    of planning and deliberation applies to all of the components of the mental
    element under s. 229(a)(ii). Accordingly, even though recklessness is
    essentially “an afterthought” in the mental element, in <i>Nygaard</i>, at p. 1088, Cory J. said “[t]he planning and deliberation
    to cause the bodily harm which is likely to be fatal must of necessity include
    the planning and deliberating to continue and to persist in that conduct
    despite the knowledge of the risk.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, even if the jury rejected the defence
    theory of a plan for a gang fight, it was open to them to conclude that Banwait
    planned and deliberated nothing more than ambushing Malik (and whatever
    supporters he managed to enlist) and beating him severely, but that he did not
    plan and deliberate inflicting multiple blows to Malik’s head with blunt
    instruments or turn his mind to the likelihood of Malik’s death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where it is not clear that events unfolded in the way
    that an accused planned, in addition to linking the requirement of planning and
    deliberation to the necessary mental element under s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii),
    I think it is desirable that the trial judge explain to the jury how the
    requirement of planning and deliberation affects the components of the mental
    element. At a minimum, the trial judge should caution the jury against relying
    on findings that fall short of satisfying the requirements of a planned and
    deliberate first degree murder under ss. 231(2) and 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is because it is essential that the jury
    understand that the accused must plan and deliberate causing bodily harm <i>of a kind</i> the accused <i>knows</i> is <i>likely</i> to cause death and must be cautious not to jump to a
    conclusion that the accused planned that degree of harm and recognized the
    likelihood of death simply because the bodily harm the accused actually caused resulted
    in death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such instructions might set out the following
    requirements for making a finding of first degree murder under ss. 231(2) and
    229(a)(ii): </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (i)        <span class=GramE>the</span> accused
    planned and deliberated causing bodily harm;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (ii)      the
    accused <i>recognized</i>, while planning
    and deliberating, that <i>the bodily harm
    she was planning</i> was <i>likely</i> to
    cause the victim’s death and proceeded with her plan not caring whether death
    ensued; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (iii)     <span class=GramE>the</span> fact that the manner of carrying
    out a general plan to cause bodily harm results in the victim’s death is not
    sufficient, in itself, to ground a finding of planned and deliberate first
    degree murder under s. 229(a)(ii).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, several features of the evidence
    suggested it was unlikely that Banwait knew that his plan would unfold in the
    way that it did. For example, the evidence that Malik tried to enlist
    supporters at the Rexdale house before going to the Albion Mall suggested that
    Banwait had no way of knowing that Malik would arrive essentially alone and
    unarmed. Further, it is apparent that Banwait had no way of controlling when or
    where Malik would arrive. Moreover, the fact that Banwait and Matharu went
    downstairs at the pool hall on their own to look for Malik undermines the suggestion
    of a well-organized plan to cause the injuries that were actually inflicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I think that the trial judge’s instructions
    went some distance towards addressing the points I have identified, I am not
    satisfied they went far enough. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge linked the requirement of planning and
    deliberation to the mental element for murder through the following caution
    when<i> </i>discussing planning and
    deliberation:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is <b>murder</b> itself that must be both planned and deliberate, <b>not</b> something else that Mr. Banwait did or said. <i>The planning and deliberation must be for a
    “murder” and not merely for a fight</i>. [Bolding in original; italics added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he did not do so at this point, the trial
    judge set out the two possible mental elements for murder repeatedly throughout
    his charge. In these circumstances, I reject Banwait’s submission that the
    jurors would not understand that the term “murder” in this instruction referred
    to both possible mental elements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, in my opinion, the instruction that “[t]he
    planning and deliberation must be for a ‘murder’ and not merely for a fight”
    did not adequately caution the jury against jumping to a conclusion of first
    degree murder under s. 229(a)(ii) based on how the attack unfolded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s caution directed the jury’s attention
    to the distinction between planning and deliberating a gang fight and planning
    and deliberating a murder. But it did not capture the distinction between a
    general plan to ambush Malik and beat him severely and a more specific plan to
    ambush Malik and cause him bodily harm of such a kind that Banwait actually
    recognized in advance of the ambush was likely to cause Malik’s death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a juror rejected the defence theory of a planned
    gang fight and accepted the theory that Banwait planned to ambush Malik and
    cause him bodily harm, the juror still had to consider: i) whether Banwait
    planned and deliberated causing Malik bodily harm of a type he knew was likely
    to cause death and ii) whether Banwait actually recognized the likelihood of
    death <i>during the planning and
    deliberation process</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent more explicit instructions, if a juror was
    satisfied that Banwait planned to ambush Malik and cause him bodily harm, working
    up the ladder of the legal instructions, it would be easy to conclude that
    Banwait recognized, during the course of the attack, that the bodily harm he
    and his group were actually causing was likely to cause death and to rely on
    that conclusion to support a verdict of first degree murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put another way, it would be easy to find that Banwait
    planned and deliberated an ambush that turned out to be a murder and to jump
    from that finding to a verdict of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, I do not think the
    failure to give more explicit instructions was a harmless error. I say that for
    three reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, on my review of the record, although s. 229(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>i), was an available route to first degree murder, the
    Crown’s case for a planned and deliberate intentional killing was far from
    overwhelming. Given this, I think it a realistic possibility that at least some
    members of the jury harboured a doubt about whether Banwait planned to kill
    Malik and instead reached first degree murder under s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no evidence that Banwait had a specific
    motive for murder or that he ever expressed any intention to kill Malik.
    Moreover, the verdicts demonstrate that the jury rejected the Crown’s theory of
    a group plan to kill Malik. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, counsel and the trial judge took different
    views of the relative strengths of the competing theories of liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel were clearly of the view that the
    evidence at trial demonstrated that the three accused concocted a plan to kill
    Malik by ambush. They went to the jury with that theory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the trial judge and at least one
    defence counsel at trial appeared to believe that the Crown’s case for first
    degree murder rested most comfortably on ss.&nbsp;231(2) and s. 229(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>ii). Counsel for Sandhu and the trial judge both said as
    much in their pre-charge discussion on December 12, 2005; counsel for Matharu
    characterized the Crown’s position that way in his closing address; and the
    trial judge described the Crown’s position that way in his “Overview of the
    Case”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave the jury standard instructions
    that although they were required to be unanimous in their verdict, they were
    not required to be unanimous in the factual route to their verdict: <i>R. v. Thatcher</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at
    pp. 697-99.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, I consider it a realistic
    possibility that a least some members of the jury harboured a doubt about
    whether Banwait planned to kill Malik and instead reached first degree murder
    under s. 231(2) and s. 229(a)(ii).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, because it is reasonable to conclude that at
    least some members of the jury harboured a doubt about whether the accused
    planned and deliberated killing the victim and yet reached a verdict of first
    degree murder relying on ss. 231(2) and 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii), I
    think a real risk exists that at least some members of the jury jumped to a
    conclusion of first degree murder without making all of the necessary findings.
    The distinction in mental states between s. 229(a)(i) and s. 229(a)(ii) is very
    subtle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>As I have said, in <i>Nygaard</i> the
    Supreme Court of Canada noted that</span> “[t]he aspect of recklessness is
    almost an afterthought in so far as the basic intent [under <span
style='line-height:200%'>s. 229(a)(ii)] </span>is
    concerned.”<span style='line-height:200%'> In <i>Cooper</i>, the Court observed that, as
    compared to s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i), there is only a “slight
    relaxation” in the mental element required to prove murder under s.&nbsp;229(a)(ii). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>Although it is easy to understand how a juror could have a reasonable
    doubt about whether Banwait planned to kill Malik, on a practical level, it is
    difficult to conceive how Banwait could plan and deliberate causing bodily harm
    to Malik that he <i>knew</i> was likely to
    cause death without also forming <span class=GramE>an intent</span> to kill.  His plan was not conceived immediately prior
    to the attack or with any apparent haste. If he recognized the likelihood of
    Malik’s death based on what he planned, it is difficult to accept that he did
    not plan to kill him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the distinction in the mental states for a
    planned and deliberate murder under ss. 229(a)(i) and 229(a)(ii) is so subtle, and
    because it was possible that a juror could reach a verdict of first degree
    murder under s. 229(a)(ii) while harbouring a doubt under s. 229(a)(i), I think
    it was especially important that the trial judge tell the jury that the manner
    of carrying out a general plan to cause bodily harm that results in the victim’s
    death is not sufficient, in itself, to ground a finding of a planned and
    deliberate first degree murder. Without such a caution, a real concern exists
    that at least some members of the jury jumped to a conclusion of first degree
    murder based solely on how the attack unfolded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, as Banwait’s counsel and the trial judge did not
    share the same understanding concerning whether the Crown was relying on both
    ss. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>i) and (ii), I think that an explicit
    caution against jumping to a conclusion of first degree murder was particularly
    important. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the confusion about which sections the Crown
    was relying on, trial counsel for Banwait did not address the jury on s. 229(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>ii). However, the trial judge left both ss. 229(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>i) and (ii) with the jury because he thought Crown counsel
    referred to both sections in their closing. On appeal, the Crown acknowledges
    the trial Crown did not refer to s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) in his
    closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well settled that, as a general rule, the Crown
    is entitled to modify its position as a trial progresses and that a trial judge
    is entitled to instruct the jury on all available routes to liability even if
    the Crown chooses not to rely on a particular theory of liability: <i>R. v. Pickton</i>, 2010 SCC 32. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in <i>R. v.
    Ranger</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 136, this Court explained that
    although it is open to a trial judge to leave a theory of liability not
    advanced by the Crown, failing to advise counsel of an intention to do so prior
    to the addresses can adversely affect trial fairness and require a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banwait did not rely on <i>Ranger</i> in his submissions on appeal.  No doubt that was because both theories of
    liability were in play during the course of the trial. Nonetheless, the
    confusion about what sections the Crown was relying on affects the issue of the
    adequacy of the jury instructions. Where counsel did not address the jury on a
    theory of liability left with the jury by the trial judge because of a
    misunderstanding about what sections the Crown was relying on and without
    knowing what sections the trial judge planned to leave, it was essential that
    the trial judge’s instructions on that theory be exacting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although on appeal the Crown submitted that the trial
    judge’s instructions were adequate, the Crown also made an alternate submission
    that the trial judge took s.&nbsp;229(a)(ii) away from the jury as a route to
    first degree murder by confining his description of the Crown’s position on
    first degree murder to s. 229(a)(i). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject this submission. The trial judge repeatedly
    described the mental element necessary for murder in terms of both subsections
    and he linked the requirement of planning and deliberation to the mental
    element for murder generally. Further, in his “Overview of the Case”, he
    described the Crown’s position on planning and deliberation as relying on s.
    229(a)(ii). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, I would give effect to this
    ground of appeal. However in fairness to the trial judge, I wish to acknowledge
    that this was a complex case involving many layers of legal issues. I consider
    it particularly unfortunate that Crown counsel did not assist the trial judge
    by clarifying which section(s) they were relying on either during the
    pre-charge conference on December 12, 2005 or when counsel for Banwait objected
    to s. 229(a)(ii) being left following completion of the trial judge’s charge to
    the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will address the issue of remedy after dealing with
    Banwait’s remaining ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his closing address to the jury, Crown counsel
    referred to the subject of post-offence conduct and said, “[t]here are several
    pieces of evidence about what the defendants did and said after the attack at

    in this case.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel noted that all three defendants fled the

    never discovered. He suggested it was a reasonable inference that the weapons
    were disposed of so the evidence they might provide would not be discovered and
    he reminded the jury that Banwait told his sister that their father was going
    to send him to India. He also discussed other aspects of the evidence relating
    to the other two defendants, including evidence that Matharu had lied in his
    statement to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel concluded his discussion of this subject
    by saying, “[t]his evidence of the actions and statements by all three
    defendants after the attack is consistent with their knowledge that they had
    committed a crime on the night of June 6, 2003.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (b) The
    Trial Judge's Instructions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided the jury with a general
    summary of the post-incident conduct evidence and said, “[t]hese circumstances
    may, or may not, depending upon your assessment of them, tend to incriminate a
    defendant in a crime, such as first degree murder, second degree murder or
    manslaughter.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then gave the jury specific instructions concerning
    their use of each aspect of the post-incident evidence relied on by the Crown. In
    doing so, he tied his instructions to the concept of whether any of the defendants
    was a “party” to the crime. For example, concerning flight, the trial judge
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Evidence that a defendant fled from the scene of a
    criminal (sic) may help you decide whether the defendant was a “party” to the
    crime.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What a defendant did after a crime may indicate
    that he acted in a way which, according to human experience and logic, is
    consistent with the conduct of the person who was a “party” to the crime and
    inconsistent with the conduct of one who was not a “party” to it. On the other
    hand, there may be another explanation for flight from the scene of a crime,
    something unconnected with participation in it as a “party”. …Be cautious. This
    process could lead to a finding of fact, either in favour of, or against, a
    defendant, to be considered with all of the other evidence in determining
    whether or not the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    defendant was a “party” to the crime. Recall the definition of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to Matharu, the trial judge reminded the
    jury that Matharu's Counsel conceded in his closing address that, subject to an
    issue about honest consent by Malik to fight Banwait, Matharu was guilty of
    manslaughter. The trial judge instructed the jury that in the light of this
    concession they could only use any post-incident conduct of Matharu in
    determining his guilt or innocence on the charge of manslaughter.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (c)
    Banwait's Position on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Banwait points out that although he did not
    acknowledge at trial that he should be convicted of any offence, he did
    acknowledge through counsel that he was present at the attack and that he hit
    Malik once with a hammer. Further, counsel on appeal notes that the defences Banwait
    advanced at trial (lack of causation; Malik's consent to the fight) were <span
class=GramE>so</span> implausible as to be absurd. In these circumstances, the
    only real issue for the jury was whether he was guilty of first degree murder,
    second degree murder or manslaughter. Accordingly, he contends that the trial
    judge erred by failing to instruct the jury that the post-incident conduct evidence
    relevant to him had negligible probative value.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (d) Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I agree that it would have been preferable had
    the trial judge instructed the jury specifically that they could not use
    evidence of post-incident conduct in determining the level of culpability of
    any of the defendants as he did for Matharu, I am not persuaded that Banwait
    has demonstrated reversible error in the trial judge's instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever Banwait now says about the viability of the defences
    he raised at trial, the fact remains that he did not admit his guilt of any
    offence. Accordingly, he was not entitled to a <span class=GramE>no</span> probative value instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, on the facts of this case, I fail to see any
    air of reality to the suggestion that the jury would somehow have used the
    evidence of Banwait's post-incident conduct to conclude that he was guilty of
    first degree murder as opposed to second degree murder or manslaughter, or to
    conclude that he was guilty of second degree murder as opposed to manslaughter.
    Neither the trial Crown nor the trial judge suggested to the jury that they
    could use the post-incident conduct evidence to determine Banwait’s level of
    culpability. Further, the post-incident conduct evidence in issue does not itself
    give rise to that chain of reasoning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I note that trial counsel for Banwait not only
    did not object to the trial judge's instructions on this issue, but he also saw
    a draft of the trial judge's instructions in advance and requested some minor
    changes in the language. Although not determinative of the issue, trial
    counsel's position goes some distance to confirming there was no realistic
    likelihood that the jury misunderstood the trial judge's instructions on this
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Conclusion
    Re: Banwait's Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would accept
    Banwait's submission that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury
    on the relationship between planning and deliberation and murder as defined in s.
    229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii)  of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> but I would dismiss
    his remaining grounds of appeal. As both the Crown and Banwait agree that the
    appropriate disposition in these circumstances is to substitute a conviction
    for second degree murder, I would set aside the conviction for first degree
    murder, substitute a conviction for second degree murder and remit the matter
    to the trial judge for sentencing: see s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(i)
    and s. 686(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>; <i>R. v. Maciel </i>(2007), 219 C.C.C. (3d) 516

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><u>Matharu's Conviction Appeal</u></b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Did the trial judge misdirect the jury
    concerning Matharu's position on the pathologist's evidence?</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (a) The
    Pathologist's Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the attack, Malik remained hospitalized until
    his death on June 26, 2003. Dr. John Doucet conducted an autopsy and determined
    that the cause of death was pneumonia with complicating blunt force
    cranial-cerebral trauma. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Doucet found three main injuries to Malik's head
    and face -- one to the back of his head (the occipital area), one to the right
    side of his head (the frontal-parietal area), and one to the right side of his
    jaw (the maxilla). He described two of these injuries as being capable of
    causing death individually -- the injury to the back of the head and the injury
    to the right side of the head.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Doucet was unable to say how many blows caused the
    injury to the back of the head or what form of object caused the injury.
    However, it could not have been caused by a fall. Rather, it was caused by “an
    object of reasonable mass applied with considerable force”, such as a
    two-by-four piece of wood or some other object of similar mass. Alternatively,
    it could have been caused by a number of kicks with steel toed boots.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the injury to the right side of the head, Dr.
    Doucet described it as a patterned injury, meaning it had a specific
    configuration (in this case a round fracture site), that would be consistent
    with the configuration of the instrument that caused it. Dr. Doucet opined that
    this fracture might have been caused by the head of a hammer or a mallet, or
    perhaps a solid lead pipe with a similar diameter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both of these injuries caused lacerations to the surface
    of the brain and brain swelling, leaving Malik in a comatose state, intubated and
    susceptible to infection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The injury to the right side of the jaw involved
    significant force and could have been caused, for example, by the edge of a
    hammer head, by the edge of a rounded pipe or by the edge of a rounded boot
    applied with great force.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (b) The
    Trial Judge's Summary of the Defence Position on Causation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his charge to the jury, the trial judge indicated
    that all three defendants took the position that Dr. Doucet's evidence did not
    prove causation beyond a reasonable doubt because of alleged shortcomings in
    his approach to the autopsy:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The position of the defence is that the evidence of
    Dr. Doucet does not prove “causation”, as defined, beyond a reasonable doubt.
    Pneumonia was the immediate cause of death. The opinion of Dr. Doucet
    concerning the likelihood of death arising from the two main head injuries is
    not sufficient to prove causation beyond a reasonable doubt, in the defence
    submission. <i>He failed to act in a
    professional and scientific way, in that he did not read all of the medical
    records of the deceased. He acted as a puppet for the police. Return a verdict
    of “Not Guilty”. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (c)
    Matharu's Position on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Matharu contends that the trial judge erred
    by misrepresenting to the jury his position on causation and on Dr. Doucet’s
    credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Matharu, Dr. Doucet's evidence went a long
    way to advancing his defence -- it neutralized the evidence of eyewitnesses who
    exaggerated the extent and quantity of blows to Malik's head. Moreover, it
    established that Matharu could not have struck Malik with a pipe as each of the
    three injuries observed by Dr. Doucet was accounted for by other mechanisms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matharu maintains that it was Sandhu who raised the
    issue of causation and attacked Dr. Doucet's credibility, and that Banwait
    ultimately adopted Sandhu’s position. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matharu contends that the trial judge's description of
    his position on causation undermined his true position, namely, that Dr. Doucet’s
    evidence undermined the credibility of various eyewitnesses, precluded a
    finding that Matharu struck Malik with the pipe and bolstered the credibility
    of Matharu's statement to the police. Moreover, he claims that he objected to
    these aspects of the trial judge's charge and that the trial judge erred by failing
    to correct his mischaracterizations.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (d)
    Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept these submissions for four reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, on my review of the record, Matharu's position
    at trial was more complicated than he now acknowledges. Following
    cross-examination of Dr. Doucet, Crown counsel noted that defence counsel had
    previously indicated that causation was not an issue and said that it now
    appeared that it was. The trial judge agreed. Matharu’s counsel did not disavow
    that suggestion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in my opinion, it is far from clear that
    Matharu objected to anything other than the suggestion that the defence
    characterized Dr. Doucet as a puppet for the police:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Matharu's
    counsel</b>:  When Your Honour is
    addressing Dr.&nbsp;Doucet’s evidence pertaining to causation … Your Honour has
    stated, in terms of the position of the defence, that “he acted as a puppet for
    the police”, and, in my respectful submission, that characterization of Dr.
    Doucet was never presented on behalf of Mr. Matharu either in submissions or in
    cross-examination, and I have concerns that the way experts are often—and
    medical doctors are somewhat treated reverentially by citizens and the jury,
    that such a negative comment may reflect poorly on Mr. Matharu.  That was never my approach to Dr. Doucet. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court</b>:  You are right in making the observation.  That was not your position on that
    issue.  Your position, in my mind, was
    the wise one to take from the defence perspective, but leaving aside that,
    here’s what happened in the trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Matharu's counsel:  Mm-hmm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court</b>:  Mr. Moon took leadership on the issue, and
    the other two defendants basically said Mr. Moon has made submissions on that
    and I’m not going to state anything else.  So you kind of left it there, urging them, in effect, to give your
    client the benefit of anything that Mr. Moon might have achieved on the issue
    of causation, without taking expressly any position on the issue.  So that’s what got me to that draftsmanship.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Matharu's counsel:  Mm-hmm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court</b>:  I don’t think it’s a big issue, but if they
    come back with a question on that, I’ll make sure you’re accommodated on that
    point.  I do not anticipate them coming back
    with a question on the issue of causation, but it’s a strange world.  Who knows what is going to happen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, contrary to Matharu's position on appeal, Dr.
    Doucet's evidence did not preclude a finding that Matharu struck Malik with the
    pipe he was carrying. Nor did it support the credibility of his statement to
    the police that he only kicked Matharu. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, in his evidence, Dr. Doucet
    specifically allowed for the possibility that one or more of Malik's head
    injuries were caused by a blow with a pipe. Moreover, Dr. Doucet testified that
    if Malik had indeed been kicked hard in the body he would have expected to see
    some sign of it when he conducted the autopsy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in my opinion, the trial judge’s summary of
    Matharu's position in relation to Dr. Doucet's evidence was extremely fair. He
    referred to Matharu's position that the eyewitness testimony concerning the
    attack was inconsistent and that Dr. Doucet's description of Malik's injuries
    proved the eyewitnesses unreliable.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(2)       Did the trial judge
    err in finding that Matharu's statements to the police were voluntary?</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (a) Matharu’s
    arrest and statements to the police</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence concerning Matharu's arrest and statements to
    the police was initially led on a blended <i>voir
    dire</i> addressing voluntariness and <i>Charter</i> issues. On the <i>voir dire</i>, the Crown
    called all of the officers who had contact with Matharu prior to him giving any
    statements. Matharu did not testify on the <i>voir
    dire</i>.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matharu was arrested in the afternoon on the day
    following the attack. After arresting Banwait, police received information that
    a second suspect, who had been armed with a pipe, was involved in the incident.
    Police also received a first name and telephone number for this person. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At about 1 p.m. on June 7, 2003, Det. Robert Gallant
    called the telephone number and told Matharu that police were investigating a
    serious assault at the Albion Mall and wanted to talk to him as they had
    information he was involved. Matharu said he had family present and would not
    be available until after 3 p.m. On being asked, he gave his address to Gallant.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After speaking to Matharu, Gallant asked Det. Brian
    Johnston, a member of the CIB day shift, to go to Matharu’s home and arrest him
    for attempted murder. Gallant called Matharu and told him that police officers
    would be coming to his house and asked him to go to the front door to speak
    with them. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Matharu went to the front door he asked Johnston
    if they could speak outside as he did not “want [his] parents to know about
    this.” He went to the officers’ car and got into the backseat with detective
    Constable Ferguson. Johnston and Constable Paweska got into the front seat.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once inside the car, Johnston told Matharu they were
    there “about the incident at Albion Road last night.” Matharu said, “I wasn't
    at Albion last night. I was in Mississauga all night.” Johnston testified that
    he responded, “Well that's not what we heard. My information is that you were
    involved in a fight at the mall and that you were hitting the guy with the
    pipe, so I have to tell you you're under arrest for attempted murder and
    assault with a weapon.” Matharu replied, “But sir, I only kicked the guy.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Johnston testified that he then informed Matharu that
    before Matharu said anything further, Johnston would have to caution him.
    According to Johnston, he read Matharu his rights to counsel and the primary
    and secondary cautions and asked Matharu if he understood. Matharu said “yes”
    and answered “no” when asked if he wanted to speak to a lawyer “now”. Johnston
    told Matharu they would let him give his side of the story at the police
    station.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the officers, Matharu began speaking
    spontaneously several minutes into the trip. Paweska testified that he recorded
    the following statement in a steno pad he was using to keep running notes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Okay I'll tell you we were driving around. They
    call me, said go to Macs, Highway 10 and Eglinton. We got there and Aman...
    said let's go to Albion Mall. He got inside car and we drove. Aman called
    someone. <span class=GramE>Tells to meet him at Albion Mall.</span> We get
    there. A gray Grand Am pulls up. A guy jumped out of car. That girl knew the
    guy. <span class=GramE>Jumped between him and Aman.</span> Someone hit this guy
    in the back of the head with a cricket bat. Couple guys hit him. Lots of guys
    came out. Two to three guys hit him. Aman had a hammer. <span class=GramE>Kept
    hitting the guy.</span> I had a pipe down my pants. I didn't hit them. I kicked
    him. We left, went to Country Style. This girl drank cleaner. We went to
    hospital. Aman left with other guys.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Johnston asked Matharu a series of questions to identify
    who was with him, whose car they were in, where he and Aman had obtained their
    weapons and what he did with the pipe. After Matharu indicated he threw the
    pipe out the car window near Kennedy and Eglinton, the police headed to the
    location where the pipe was discarded and conducted a search. Police searched
    for about 25 minutes without success and then headed to the police station.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Johnston did a pat down search on Matharu after he was
    booked. He then took Matharu to an interview room, where he and Paweska did a
    strip search. Johnson advised Matharu that he had basically told them
    everything that had happened but he could now provide his side of the story.
    Matharu said he only “kicked him” and that Aman hit him with a hammer. He
    agreed to provide a video statement in which he essentially reiterated his
    earlier version of the events.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (b) The
    Statement <i>Voir Dire</i> at the
    Preliminary Inquiry</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The voluntariness of Matharu's statements was the
    subject of a <i>voir dire</i> at the
    preliminary inquiry. After hearing evidence from Johnston, Paweska and
    Ferguson, the preliminary inquiry judge drew adverse inferences concerning
    their credibility and ruled Matharu's statements involuntary.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (c) The
    Trial Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matharu's trial counsel argued that the police officers’
    evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> was not
    credible and that their evidence raised issues about whether Matharu was
    arrested and cautioned before arriving at the police station and before making
    various statements to the police. Defence counsel relied, in part, on the officers’
    failure to audiotape or videotape their interactions with Matharu. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After observing that there were some differences in the
    officers’ notes concerning their interactions with Matharu and concerning the
    statements that he made, the trial judge concluded that the officers’ notes
    constituted a reasonably accurate record of events and did not leave him with a
    reasonable doubt on the issue of voluntariness because of a lack of a
    sufficient record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning certain omissions from Ferguson’s notes, the
    trial judge accepted Ferguson's explanation that he was responsible for the
    safe custody of Matharu and therefore did not pay much attention to the
    dialogue between Johnston and Matharu. Although the trial judge said it would
    have been preferable to at least audiotape all of the exchanges with Matharu,
    he found that Johnston's notes were a reliable record of those exchanges
    because Johnston made his notes as he spoke and took care to speak at a pace
    that permitted him to make accurate notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the issue of when Matharu was arrested, the
    trial judge rejected defence counsel's argument that the police officers’
    failure to put handcuffs on or conduct a pat down search of Matharu when he was
    placed in the police car and their failure to keep Matharu in the police car
    while they searched for the pipe was inconsistent with their claim that they
    arrested Matharu at his house. In reaching his conclusion, the trial judge
    considered the evidence as a whole including the following factors: Gallant
    instructed Johnston to arrest Matharu; Johnston, Ferguson and Paweska went to
    Matharu's home for that purpose; the officer's positioning around Matharu's
    house suggested an arrest; Johnston did not believe that Matharu was likely
    armed when he emerged from his house because he was wearing a T-shirt and track
    pants; Matharu was cooperative with the police and Johnston testified that he
    exercised his discretion against handcuffing because he had no information that
    Matharu might be dangerous or take flight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge concluded that the initial
    strip search of Matharu in the interview room was unreasonable, he found that
    the strip search was not causally linked to Matharu's video statement and
    therefore did not raise a reasonable doubt on the issue of voluntariness.
    Finally, the trial judge rejected defence counsel's submissions that Gallant
    and other officers engaged in tricks or deceit that would render Matharu's
    statements involuntary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to voluntariness, defence counsel raised
    various <i>Charter</i> issues in relation to
    Matharu’s statements. The trial judge’s rulings on those issues are not the
    subject of this appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (d) Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Matharu argues that the trial judge made two
    critical errors in his voluntariness ruling. First, Matharu submits that the
    trial judge erred by failing to consider the importance of the preliminary
    hearing<i> voir dire </i>in his credibility
    findings. Matharu contends that the fact that the police officers had already
    been subject to extensive cross-examination, which resulted in adverse
    credibility findings against them, should have factored heavily in the trial
    judge's assessment of their evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Matharu claims that the trial judge’s
    credibility findings reveal a significant inconsistency in that the trial judge
    accepted Ferguson's explanation for failing to record important details because
    of concerns about officer safety, yet the trial judge also accepted Johnston's
    evidence that it was unnecessary to handcuff and search Matharu upon arrest.
    Matharu also contends that the trial judge ignored or failed to appreciate a
    variety of relevant evidence in arriving at his credibility findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the first issue, the Supreme Court of Canada
    has repeatedly held that the doctrine of issue estoppel does not apply to
    statement <i>voir dires</i>: <i>R. v. Mahalingan</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 316;<i> R. v. Duhamel</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 555.
    Accordingly, the Crown is not barred from seeking to introduce a statement
    ruled inadmissible in a prior proceeding, and the duty of a trial judge
    presiding on a subsequent <i>voir dire</i> is to consider the admissibility issue afresh based on the evidence adduced in
    the subsequent proceeding. Moreover, the judge presiding at the subsequent
    hearing does not owe deference to factual or credibility findings made at an
    earlier hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, it would have been readily apparent to
    the trial judge, based on the evidence and submissions on the <i>voir <span class=GramE>dire<span
style='font-style:normal'>, that</span></span></i> the police officers had had
    some “practice” at the preliminary inquiry in testifying about the
    circumstances of Matharu’s arrest and his statements. However, that was but one
    factor, among many, for the trial judge to consider in assessing the issues on the <i>voir dire</i>. In my opinion, it is clear
    from the trial judge’s reasons that he was alive to the centrality of the
    police officers’ credibility, that he gave careful consideration to that issue
    and that he came to his own conclusions for reasons that he explained. I reject
    as unfounded Matharu’s argument that the fact of the police officer’s prior
    testimony should have factored heavily in the trial judge’s consideration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the second issue, I do not accept Matharu’s submission
    that there was an inconsistency in the trial judge’s credibility findings.
    Johnston testified that he did not view Matharu as a flight risk or a security risk
    and that, for that reason, he did not consider it necessary to handcuff Matharu
    or search him before inviting him into the back of the police car and arresting
    him. Johnston testified that was his decision alone. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Ferguson explained that he was
    sitting in the back of the police car, with his gun side to Matharu. He was
    concerned about safety because of the close quarters and potential
    consequences. Having regard to the circumstances, it was open to the trial
    judge to accept the evidence of both officers – they were faced with different
    decisions in different circumstances. I see no inconsistency in the trial
    judge’s findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, I do not accept Matharu’s submission that
    the trial judge ignored or failed to appreciate a variety of relevant evidence
    in arriving at his credibility findings. The trial judge gave a detailed ruling
    in which he carefully explained why he rejected the defence submissions and
    accepted the evidence of the police officers in relation to the voluntariness
    issue. The fact that the trial judge did not find compelling items of evidence
    that Matharu submits could have led to a different conclusion does mean that
    the trial judge misapprehended or ignored relevant evidence. It simply means
    that the trial judge reached a different conclusion for the reasons that he
    explained. </p>

    Position on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matharu submits that the verdict of second degree
    murder was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge left with the jury two routes to
    convict Matharu of second degree murder: i) as a principal on the basis that he
    struck Malik with the pipe, inflicting one of the two significant injuries that
    caused Malik's death, and that he acted with one of the intents described in s.
    229(a); and ii) as an aider or abettor on the basis that he assisted or
    encouraged the perpetrator in committing murder and that he did so with
    knowledge of the perpetrator’s intention and an intention to assist the
    perpetrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the availability of a finding that he was
    guilty of second degree murder as a principal, Matharu contends that the
    evidence of the only witnesses that could support a finding that he struck
    Malik with the pipe was so unreliable as to be unworthy of belief. In addition,
    he submits that the evidence of Dr. Doucet effectively eliminated him as a
    perpetrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the availability of a finding that he was
    guilty of second degree murder as an aider or abettor, Matharu contends that
    there was a significant body of evidence suggesting that he was an unwilling
    participant in the attack on Malik and that he abandoned the assault at an
    early stage. Moreover, he submits that there was no evidence capable of
    establishing that he possessed the requisite intent for second degree murder.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the availability of a finding that Matharu
    was guilty of second degree murder as a principal, I conclude that it was open
    to the jury to find that he struck Malik in the head with a metal pipe.
    Moreover, I reject his submission that Dr. Doucet’s evidence effectively
    eliminated the possibility that he struck one of the fatal blows. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three witnesses gave evidence capable of supporting a
    finding that Matharu struck Malik in the head with a pipe: Mutti-ur Rehman,
    Hammad Khan and Azzm Khan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In examination-in-chief, Rehman testified that after
    Banwait hit Malik with his hammer, Matharu hit Malik in the head with a metal
    pipe at least two or three times. Rehman acknowledged in cross-examination that
    he did not mention the pipe when he first spoke to the police on the night of
    the attack and that, in fact, he told police twice that he did not see “the red
    bandana guy” (that is, Matharu) hit Malik. However, in re-examination he
    confirmed that he told the police that he saw the red bandana guy hit Malik
    with his pipe. In addition, he confirmed that, at the preliminary inquiry, he
    testified that he saw the person with the red bandana swing his weapon at Malik
    but could not see where the blow landed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hammad Khan testified that he saw the red bandana guy
    swing at Malik, though he did not see contact. Azzm Khan testified that Banwait
    or Matharu or both were the first to hit Malik. He could not tell which one hit
    him <span class=GramE>first,</span> it could have been both hitting him at the
    same time. He was sure Malik was hit in the head two or three times with a
    hammer. When it was suggested that he did not see a pipe hit Malik, he
    responded: “I'm not sure about the second object.... Could have been anything,
    but it was a metal object for sure. It could have been a hammer; could have
    been a pipe; could have been anything else made out of metal.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Dr. Doucet’s evidence suggested the likelihood
    that the lethal injury to the side of Malik's head was caused by a hammer with
    an oval shaped head, his evidence left it open to the jury to find that the
    lethal injury to the back of Malik's head was caused by a pipe or by multiple
    blows, possibly from different weapons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly in the light of the evidence of multiple
    blows being administered to Malik’s head with blunt force instruments, there
    was ample evidence to support a finding that the person(s) administering those
    blows had one of the requisite intents for murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, I conclude that there was a sufficient
    evidentiary basis to permit the jury to find Matharu guilty of second degree
    murder as a principal on the basis described by the trial judge. Moreover, <span
lang=EN-US>like the Crown on appeal, I think it
    at least arguable that the trial judge’s instructions on the issue of liability
    for second degree murder as a principal were overly favourable to the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I am satisfied that there was ample
    evidence to permit the jury to find Matharu guilty of second degree murder as
    an aider and abettor. That evidence included the following:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence that upon Malik's arrival at the Albion
    Mall, Matharu stepped towards him along with Banwait and called and gestured to
    the armed group assembled across the parking lot to “ come, come”;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence that Matharu was armed with a metal
    pipe and pulled out a pipe on Malik's arrival;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Matharu’s acknowledgement in his statement to
    the police that he was waving the pipe during the course of the attack and that
    after Malik was on the ground he kicked him hard in the side;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=GramE>evidence</span> that during
    the course of the attack Malik was struck on the head several times with blunt
    force instruments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considered in combination, at a minimum, the foregoing
    evidence was capable of supporting a conclusion that Matharu was present for
    the purpose of assisting in the attack on Malik. Further, it was capable of
    supporting a conclusion that, at least at some point during the course of the
    attack, both Matharu and the perpetrators would have inevitably realized that
    the injuries being inflicted were likely to cause death and that Matharu
    persisted in kicking Malik for the purpose of assisting in the attack.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the evidence Matharu points to as
    suggesting that he was an unwilling participant in the attack and that he
    abandoned the assault at some stage does no more than demonstrate that it may
    have been open to the jury to reach a different conclusion depending on their
    view of the totality of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have read the draft reasons prepared by my colleague
    Simmons J.A. I agree with her that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Mathuru’s</span> appeal from his conviction for second degree murder should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with two of my colleague’s conclusions
    with respect to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Banwait’s</span> conviction for first
    degree murder – namely, the jury’s verdict was not unreasonable and the trial
    judge did not err in failing to direct the jury on the negligible value of
    post-offence conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, my colleague concludes that the trial judge
    did not properly instruct the jury on the relationship between planning and
    deliberation and murder as defined under s.&nbsp;229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Accordingly,
    she would allow the appeal and substitute a conviction for second degree
    murder. I respectfully disagree with her reasoning and conclusion on this
    issue. As my colleague has provided a full description of the facts and has set
    out the relevant portions of the trial judge’s jury charge, I can state my
    reasons for disagreement in brief compass.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with four contextual points.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, when assessing the adequacy of a jury charge, a
    reviewing court must have regard to the context of the trial as a whole. A
    trial judge’s instructions are not to be held to a standard of perfection. An
    accused is entitled to a properly instructed jury, not a perfectly instructed
    jury. It is the overall effect of the charge that matters: see <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at <span
class=SpellE>paras</span>. 1-2.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, it is essential that a reviewing court bear in
    mind the audience to whom the charge is addressed – it is a jury consisting of
    12 citizens listening carefully because they are aware that <span class=GramE>they,</span> and they alone, will be called upon to make an important and difficult
    decision. Accordingly, the proper approach to be taken by an appellate court in
    assessing a jury charge is, as stated by <span class=SpellE>Bastarache</span> J. in <i>R. v. Daley</i>, [2007] 3. S.C.R.
    523, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 30-31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The cardinal rule is that it is the general sense
    which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to the mind of the
    jury that matters.... In determining the general <span class=GramE>sense which
    the words used have</span> likely conveyed to the jury, the appellate tribunal
    will consider the charge as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the experienced criminal trial judge in this
    case employed, almost word-for-word, the model final jury instructions for
    planned and deliberate murder as set out in David Watt, <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (Toronto: Thomson
    Carswell, 2005) at 435 (the Watt Instructions) in his jury charge.  These instructions are the product of the
    lengthy and focussed collaboration of many of the very best criminal law
    judges, lawyers and academics in Canada. If appellate courts conclude too
    easily or too often that these instructions are wrong or insufficient, charging
    a jury will become a perilous endeavour indeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, all three trial counsel made no objection to
    the content of the jury charge on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against this backdrop, I turn to the issue of the
    sufficiency of the trial judge’s charge on the relationship between planning
    and deliberation and murder as defined under s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>229. Culpable homicide is murder</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>where</span> the person who
    causes the death of a human being</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>means to cause his death, or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely
    to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge charged on both components of this
    provision. My colleague concludes that his charge on the second component was
    insufficient. The core of her reasoning is at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    61-63:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, even if the jury rejected the defence
    theory of a plan for a gang fight, it was open to them to conclude that <span
class=SpellE>Banwait</span> planned and deliberated nothing more than ambushing
    Malik (and whatever supporters he managed to enlist) and beating him severely,
    but that he did not plan and deliberate inflicting multiple blows to <span
class=SpellE>Malik’s</span> head with blunt instruments or turn his mind to the
    likelihood of <span class=SpellE>Malik’s</span> death.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where it is not clear that events unfolded in the
    way that an accused planned, in addition to linking the requirement of planning
    and deliberation to the necessary mental element under s. 229(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>ii), I think it is desirable that the trial judge explain
    to the jury how the requirement of planning and deliberation affects the
    components of the mental element. At a minimum, the trial judge should caution
    the jury against relying on findings that fall short of satisfying the
    requirements of a planned and deliberate first degree murder under ss. 231(2)
    and 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is because it is essential that the jury
    understand that the accused must plan and deliberate causing bodily harm <i>of a kind</i> the accused <i>knows is likely</i> to cause death and must
    be cautious not to jump to a conclusion that the accused planned that degree of
    harm and recognized the likelihood of death simply because the bodily harm the
    accused actually caused resulted in death. <span class=GramE>[Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For several reasons, I do not agree with this critique
    of the trial judge’s charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge explicitly linked the mental
    element relating to causing bodily harm and the mental element relating to the
    likelihood of causing death. He did this first in the <i>Overview</i> section of his charge, where he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The case for the Crown is that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Banwait</span>, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Matharu</span> and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sandhu</span> agreed to cause serious injuries to <span
class=SpellE>Raheel</span> Malik that they knew would likely kill him....</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge instructed the jury in a similar
    fashion when he turned to the case against Mr. <span class=SpellE>Banwait</span>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Let me now deal with the fourth issue to be
    determined in the case against Mr. <span class=SpellE>Banwait</span>, namely,
    if the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Banwait</span>,
    as a principal offender who caused the death of <span class=SpellE>Raheel</span> Malik:</p>

    him and went ahead anyway not caring if <span class=SpellE>Raheel</span> Malik
    died …. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these passages easily comply with Cory J.’s
    description of the mental elements of s. 229(a)(ii) of the <i>Code</i> in <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Nygaard</span></i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1074, at 1088:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he section requires the accused to <i>intend</i> to cause the gravest of bodily
    harm that is so dangerous and serious that <i>he
    knows </i> it is likely to cause death....
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, immediately after he charged the jury with
    respect to s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) – indeed beginning in the
    same sentence and continuing for several paragraphs – the trial judge
    explicitly linked the mental elements required under s. 229(a)(ii) with the s.
    231(2) requirement that the murder be both planned and deliberate. The language
    of this component of the charge was the standard language from the Watt
    Instructions, coupled with an application to the relevant facts of the case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A planned murder is one that is committed as a
    result of a scheme or plan that has been <i>previously
    formulated or designed</i>. It is the implementation of that scheme or design.
    A “murder” committed on a sudden impulse and without prior consideration, even
    with an intention to kill is not a planned murder.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Deliberate” is not a word that we often use when
    speaking to other people. It means “considered, not impulsive”, “carefully
    thought out, not hasty or rash”, “slow in deciding”, “cautious”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A deliberate act is one that the actor has taken
    time to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of. <i>The deliberation must take place before the act of <span class=GramE>murder,
    that</span> is, before the verbal confrontation with the deceased at the Albion
    Mall started.</i> A murder committed on a sudden impulse and without prior
    consideration, even with an intention to kill is not a deliberate murder.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I fail to see how these two components of the jury
    charge – relating to planning and deliberation and relating to intent to cause
    bodily harm with knowledge of a likelihood of causing death – are insufficient
    in this case. The trial judge employed the language from the standard jury
    charge with respect to both ss. 231(2) and 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii)
    of the <i>Code</i>. In my view, this language
    is clear and long-accepted (<span class=SpellE><i>Nygaard</i></span>). Moreover, he directly linked the two components
    and immediately applied them to the relevant facts of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Daley</i> at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 30, <span class=SpellE>Bastarache</span> J. said that
    “[t]<span class=GramE>he</span> cardinal rule is that it is the general sense
    which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to the mind of the
    jury that matters”. Looking at the trial judge’s definition of the phrases
    “planned and deliberate” and “means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is
    likely to cause his death” and the structure of his charge, I cannot see, as my
    colleague does, an insufficient linkage between his discussion of s. 231(2) and
    his discussion of s. 229(a)(ii).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial judge did provide precisely the
    warning my colleague proposes, namely that he “caution the jury against relying
    on findings that fall short of satisfying the requirements of a planned and
    deliberate first degree murder”.  He
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is murder itself that must be both planned and
    deliberate, not something else that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Banwait</span> did
    or said. The planning and deliberation must be for a “murder” and not merely
    for a fight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, my colleague thinks that “a real concern
    exists that at least some members of the jury jumped to a conclusion of first
    degree murder based solely on how the attack unfolded.” In my view, the above
    passage (and other similar passages) from the trial judge’s charge are a direct
    and sufficient response to this concern.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, I return to the shared instruction from the
    Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in <i>Jacquard</i> and <i>Daley</i> – the jury charge must be
    considered in its entirety. In that vein, it is always important to consider
    not only the legal definition of criminal offences and legal concepts provided
    by the trial judge, but also the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence
    relating to the offences and concepts. On that score, the trial judge’s jury
    charge was, in my view, comprehensive and scrupulously fair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crucially, the link between the concepts in ss. 231(2)
    and 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) of the <i>Code</i>, which I say the trial judge explained appropriately, was not
    lost when he reviewed the evidence. Indeed, the link was enhanced significantly
    by the amount of evidence the trial judge reviewed relating to the issues of
    planning and deliberation and intent to cause bodily harm with knowledge of a
    likelihood that it could cause death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can illustrate this point with reference to one (of
    many) passages in the jury charge. On the issue of first degree murder, the
    trial judge comprehensively and even-handedly set out the positions of the
    Crown and the defence. He summarized the defence case under nine headings,
    explaining the ninth point in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ninth, consider the evidence of the attack on the
    deceased. The incident occurred in a well-lit parking lot of a busy mall where
    security cameras existed and security guards were on duty. This is an unlikely
    location for a planned killing. Moreover, the weapons used by Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Banwait</span> and the others, that is, a hammer, a pipe and a two
    by four, are not likely weapons of choice for a planned killing. Rather, they
    are likely weapons taken to be used if a fight got out of hand, to further
    verbal hostilities, or to sort out the “beef”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, in a practical, plain-English way, the trial
    judge linked in a single point evidence that is relevant to the concepts in
    both ss. 231(2) and 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. He made the same linkage
    in his review of the evidence in many other places throughout his charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the trial judge’s charge on planning and
    deliberation under s. 231(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> is unassailable. His charge on s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii)
    of the <i>Code</i> is entirely consistent
    with Cory J.’s description of the mental elements of this provision in <span
class=SpellE><i>Nygaard</i></span>. Finally,
    the structure and content of the jury charge, in relation to both the
    description of legal concepts in the relevant <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions and the review of the relevant evidence,
    provide an explicit and sufficient linkage between the two provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, and for the reasons of my colleague
    on the other issues, I would dismiss both appeals.</p>
