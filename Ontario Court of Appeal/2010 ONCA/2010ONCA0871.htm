    appellant was charged with five criminal offences – sexual assault, unlawful
    confinement, utter a threat to cause death, utter a threat to cause bodily
    harm, and choking with intent to assist in committing sexual assault. The
    charges arose out of a sexual encounter with the complainant in the early
    evening of November 10, 2006.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended significant portions of
    the evidence at trial with respect to three areas that materially contributed
    to the guilty verdicts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred by stating that all 11
    voicemail messages from the appellant to the complainant on November 11, 2006
    had been left before 10:30 a.m., whereas in fact the messages were left between
    2:59 and 10:34 p.m.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even
    if the trial judge did commit this factual error (it appears he did in one
    place but did not in a second place), nothing turns on it. It was the contents
    of these messages, not their timing, that were central to the trial judge’s
    reasoning. As the trial judge put it:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he assertion of the accused that the events of
    November 10, 2006, were a friendly and understanding end to a long relationship
    is simply not believable. The absence of credibility in this is underscored by
    the telephone messages he left the following day. The language used cannot be
    interpreted, as the accused would have it, as expressions of concern mitigated
    by frustration of the moment. There is no understanding and no acceptance in
    these messages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two of the messages left between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m.
    recorded the appellant as saying this to the complainant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Message 8:</b> I hope you…go party and fucking with the guy again okay if you have then all
    hell will break loose later okay I just wanted you to know that goodbye.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Message 9:</b> Why aren’t you answering your phone I’m getting madder and <span class=GramE>madder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These messages lend strong support to the trial judge’s
    rejection of the appellant’s interpretation of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant contends that the trial judge
    erroneously found that, after having been dropped off at her home by the
    appellant after the sexual encounter, the complainant was crying to A.A., her
    new boyfriend, in the first of two telephone calls they had that evening. The
    relevance of this, says the appellant, is that it was only in the second call
    that A.A. told the complainant that he had been watching her house when the
    appellant dropped her off. This provoked the complainant to cry and falsely
    allege a sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his testimony in chief, A.A. referred to the
    complainant crying during the first telephone conversation; in re-examination
    he said it was the second conversation. Again, nothing turns on this minor
    point. The trial judge mentioned it only in passing and did not use it to
    bolster the complainant’s credibility. Moreover, and importantly, the
    complainant had told A.A. about the appellant and her proposed meeting the day
    before; accordingly, she had no reason to spontaneously fabricate a sexual
    assault by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence about Belfield Road, thus undercutting the
    appellant’s assertion that it was the complainant, not him, who chose the
    secluded area for the sexual encounter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. There was no evidence
    that the complainant was familiar with the unlit warehouse parking lot on
    Belfield Road where the sexual encounter took place. Her conceded familiarity
    with Belfield Road generally did not make it more likely that she directed the
    appellant to that specific location. Accordingly, the trial judge was entitled
    to attribute “no weight to this consideration in coming to a decision in this
    case.”</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Inconsistent Verdicts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant contends that since the complainant’s allegation that he had choked
    her was an integral part of her sexual assault narrative, the acquittal for
    choking and the conviction for sexual assault are inconsistent verdicts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    disagree. The trial judge did not reject the complainant’s evidence about
    choking. Indeed, he accepted and relied on it to conclude, as a matter of <span
class=GramE>law, that</span> the offence of choking to assist in the commission
    of the offence of sexual assault was not made out. The complainant’s testimony
    was that during the sexual assault the appellant twice placed his hands on her
    throat. However, as the trial judge observed, the complainant testified that
    the appellant did not apply much pressure and did not try to choke, suffocate
    or strangle her. Based on this testimony, which the trial judge believed, he
    acquitted the appellant of the offence of choking to assist in the commission
    of sexual assault. In this context, there is no inconsistency between the one
    acquittal and the four convictions; all of the verdicts flow from the trial
    judge’s acceptance of the complainant’s testimony.</span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Inadequate consideration of the
    defence theory</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge did not adequately consider some of the
    evidence supporting the defence theory that the sexual encounter on November
    10, 2006 was consensual.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    will be recalled that the respondent was convicted of sexual assault, unlawful
    confinement, and two counts of uttering threats. These offences occurred
    following the breakdown of an intimate relationship of several years’ duration.
    The Crown sought a sentence of three to four years in jail. The defence
    position was that the respondent ought to receive a conditional sentence of two
    years less a day. The trial judge imposed a conditional sentence of two years
    less a day to be followed by three years’ probation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown appeals sentence on the basis that the sentence was unfit; it represented
    a substantial and marked departure from sentences for offences of this sort;
    and the sentence failed to give appropriate effect to general deterrence and
    denunciation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    accept these submissions. Following her decision to end her sexual relationship
    with the respondent, the complainant was the victim of a campaign of threats
    and intimidation culminating in the sexual assault on November 10 in which the
    complainant was confined to a vehicle in a secluded location and subjected to
    forced vaginal intercourse. The respondent was a person whom she had trusted,
    with whom she had been in a domestic relationship and who was a friend of her
    father. Granting a conditional sentence in these circumstances is a substantial
    and marked departure from sentences imposed for similar offenders committing
    similar crimes: see, for example, <i>R. v.
    Bradley</i>, [2008] O.J. No. 955 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the circumstances of this case however, it is not in the public interest to
    incarcerate the respondent at this point. The respondent has already served 14
    months on strict house arrest. This period of house arrest follows a period of
    approximately three years in which the respondent was subject to seriously
    restrictive bail conditions. Furthermore, incarceration at this point would
    impose a considerable hardship on the respondent’s wife, children and mother.
    Moreover and very significantly, the fresh evidence shows that the respondent
    was in a serious multi-car accident that has left him with ongoing injuries
    requiring continuing rehabilitation and he is expected to be called as a
    witness for the prosecution at the trial of two of the other drivers involved
    in the accident.</span></p>
