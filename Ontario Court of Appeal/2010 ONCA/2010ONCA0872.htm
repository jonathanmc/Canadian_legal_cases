  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents (collectively “GSK”) are a group of
    related companies engaged in the business of pharmaceutical research and
    development, as well as the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals. One of
    GSK’s products is Paxil, a prescription drug used to treat anxiety, depression
    and other disorders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Ms. Harris, is a Paxil user. She is the
    representative plaintiff in a class action in which she, and other Paxil users, <span class=GramE>contend</span> that from 1999 to 2003, GSK misused a process
    under the <i>Patent Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    P-4, to delay the entry into the Canadian market of a less expensive generic
    equivalent of Paxil. During that four-year period, Paxil users were required to
    buy Paxil at a “supra-competitive” price for which they now seek to hold GSK
    accountable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her claim on behalf of the class, the appellant
    alleges three causes of action against GSK: (1) abuse of process; (2) conspiracy;
    and (3) waiver of tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2010, GSK moved under rules 21.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) and (b) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> for an order striking out the appellant’s claim and
    dismissing the action. On April 22, 2010, Perell J., of the Superior Court of
    Justice, granted GSK’s motion. He did <span class=GramE>so on</span> the basis
    that the pleadings did not disclose a viable cause of action against GSK. In
    his view, it was plain and obvious that the action could not succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges that ruling on appeal. In
    essence, she submits that the motion judge made the following five errors:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He misdirected himself on the constituent elements of
    the tort of abuse of process;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He erred in holding that the facts as pleaded did not
    and could not establish the tort of conspiracy; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He misdirected himself in holding that a waiver of tort
    claim could not succeed absent a predicate wrongdoing;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He overstepped his mandate on a Rule 21 motion by
    making findings of fact that he was precluded from making; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He erred in summarily disposing of important and novel
    issues of law in the absence of a full and complete factual record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the motion
    judge was correct in dismissing the action against GSK. In short, I agree with
    him that the pleadings do not disclose a viable cause of action against GSK.
    Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    reasons of the motion judge are detailed and comprehensive. It is unnecessary
    to duplicate them. Most of the heavy lifting has been done. By way of
    background, I consider it sufficient to outline, in summary form, the
    regulatory regime by which GSK is governed and the salient facts that the
    appellant and other Paxil users rely on in support of their claim against GSK. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Regulatory Regime</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    marketing of drugs in Canada is governed by the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27 (“<i>FDA</i>”) and the <i>Patent Act</i>.
    The <i>FDA</i> deals with the safety and
    efficacy of drugs. Regulations made under that Act (the <i>Food and Drug Regulations</i>, C.R.C., c.&nbsp;870, Part C, Division 8,
    C.08.004) provide that a drug cannot be marketed in Canada unless and until the
    Minister of Health has issued a Notice of Compliance (“NOC”) in respect of it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Patent Act</i> deals with intellectual
    property issues relating to patented drugs and their subsequent generic copies.
    The <i>Patented Medicines (Notice of
    Compliance) Regulations,</i> S.O.R./93-133 (“<span class=GramE><i>PM</i>(</span><i>NOC) Regulations</i>”) provide that all patents pertaining to a drug
    for which a NOC has been issued may be listed in the Patent Register. These
    regulations further provide for a process whereby the interests of innovator patentees
    are balanced against the competing interests of generic manufacturers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    subsequent manufacturer that wishes to market a generic version of a patented
    drug can simply wait for the relevant patents to expire. Alternatively, s. 5(1)
    of the <span class=GramE><i>PM(</i></span><i>NOC) Regulations</i> allows a manufacturer
    to serve a Notice of Allegation (“NOA”) on the patentee asserting that the
    listed patents are invalid and/or will not be infringed by the proposed generic
    equivalent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    6(1) of the <span class=GramE><i>PM(</i></span><i>NOC) Regulations</i> provides that a patentee
    who receives a NOA may challenge the allegations made by the generic
    manufacturer by applying for judicial review in the Federal Court (a “NOC
    Proceeding”). In the NOC Proceeding, the patentee disputes the NOA and asserts
    the validity and/or infringement of the patent in issue. The patentee is given
    an opportunity to demonstrate that the allegations set forth in the NOA are
    “not justified”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Upon
    the commencement of a NOC Proceeding, s. 7(1)(e) of the <i>PM(NOC) Regulations</i> takes effect and automatically enjoins the Minister
    from issuing a NOC to the generic drug manufacturer for a period of up to 24
    months from the date of the filing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If
    the patentee prevails in a NOC Proceeding, the Minister is enjoined from
    issuing a NOC to the generic manufacturer prior to the expiry of the patent in
    issue. Alternatively, the court may dismiss a NOC Proceeding if it finds that
    the patent is invalid or would not be infringed, or that the patent holder has
    failed to show that the allegations in the NOA are not justified. In that
    event, the Minister may immediately issue a NOC for the generic product.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    possible check on the automatic 24-month stay contemplated by the filing of a NOC
    Proceeding is found in s. 6(5<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>PM(NOC) Regulations</i>. Under that
    provision, the court may dismiss <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 6(1) application
    on the ground that “the application is redundant, scandalous, frivolous or
    vexatious or is otherwise an abuse of process”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Another
    check on patentees who choose to institute NOC Proceedings is found in s. 8 of
    the <span class=GramE><i>PM(</i></span><i>NOC) Regulations</i>. Under that provision,
    where a NOC Proceeding is withdrawn or discontinued or is ultimately dismissed,
    the unsuccessful patentee is liable to the generic drug manufacturer for any
    losses the generic manufacturer may have suffered due to its inability to
    market its product during the stay period. The <span class=GramE><i>PM(</i></span><i>NOC) Regulations</i> do not, however, provide any form of relief to
    other persons or entities, including consumers who may have been adversely
    affected by a patentee’s choice to instigate a NOC Proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span

class=SpellE><i><span lang=EN-US>Apotex</span></i></span><i><span lang=EN-US> Inc. v. Merck &amp;
    Co. Inc.</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, 2009 F.C.A.
    187, the Federal Court of Appeal commented on the balance the <i>PM(NOC) Regulations</i> seek to achieve
    between the need for effective patent protection and the timely entry of
    generic drugs into the marketplace. The automatic stay that arises from the
    commencement of a NOC Proceeding is part of that balance. Its counterpart is
    the s. 8 obligation on the patentee to pay damages to a delayed generic entrant
    if the NOC Proceeding fails.  At paras.
    54 and 55 of his reasons, Noel J.A., for the court, recognized that “the
    automatic 24-month stay was capable of being used in a manner which does not
    advance patent protection” and “given the scheme, it is the patentee who has
    both the carriage of the proceeding and the interest in its dilatory
    prosecution.” At para. 56, Noel&nbsp;J.A. quoted from <i>AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Health)</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R.
    560, in which Binnie J., for the court, made the following observations at
    para.&nbsp;39:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>By
    imposing the 24-month delay called for by the <i>NOC Regulations</i>, the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal
    undermines achievement of the balance struck by Parliament between the
    objectives of the <i>FDA</i> … and
    regulations <span class=SpellE>thereunder</span> (making safe and effective
    drugs available to the public) and the <i>Patent
    Act</i> and its regulations (preventing abuse of the “early working” exception
    to patent infringement). <i>Given the evident
    (and entirely understandable) commercial strategy</i> of the innovative drug
    companies to evergreen their products by adding bells and whistles to a
    pioneering product even after the original patent for that pioneering product
    has expired, the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal would reward evergreening
    even if the generic manufacturer (and thus the public) does not thereby derive
    any benefit from the subsequently listed patents. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Binnie
    J.’s concerns about the commercial strategy of the innovative drug companies
    seeking to evergreen their products did not escape Noel J.A.’s attention.
    According to Noel J.A., s. 8 of the <span class=GramE><i>PM(</i></span><i>NOC) Regulations</i> was enacted to address the concerns mentioned by Binnie J. and others as to the
    various ways patentees might attempt to misuse the NOC regulatory regime. At
    paras. 58 to 60 of his reasons, Noel J.A. made the following observations:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Section
    8, by imposing on first persons a liability for the losses suffered by a second
    person, as a result of the operation of the automatic stay, when a prohibition
    application is withdrawn, discontinued or is ultimately unsuccessful,
    alleviates these concerns. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>By
    the same logic, [that a first person no longer has an exclusive interest in
    delaying the progress of a NOC Proceeding], a first person no longer has an
    exclusive interest in triggering the operation of the automatic stay by
    reference to patents which are not properly listed … or to ‘evergreen’ a
    patented drug in order to perpetuate the benefit which the PM(NOC) Regulations
    provide … As a result of s. 8, a first person must focus on the issue of
    infringement and consider the strength of its position before initiating a
    prohibition proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This
    promotes the use of the <span class=GramE>PM(</span>NOC) Regulations for the
    purpose for which they are intended: the prevention of infringement.
    Significantly, it does so in a manner which is consistent with maintaining the
    balance [of making safe and effective drugs available to the public and
    protecting the rights of patentees].</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Monopoly Rights of Patentees</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    considering the rights of patentees, it is essential to differentiate between a
    monopoly, in the anti-competitive, unlawful sense of the word, and an intellectual
    property right, such as a patent. For present purposes, the distinction is important
    because the appellant, in her claim, makes numerous references to GSK’s
    “monopoly” in respect of Paxil and the resulting “supra-competitive” prices GSK
    was able to charge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    distinction between intellectual property rights and unlawful anti-competitive
    acts is well-established in competition law.  For example, s. 79(5) of the <i>Competition Act</i>, R.S. 1985, c. C-34,
    provides that: “[A]n act engaged in pursuant only to the exercise of any right
    or enjoyment of any interest derived under the … <i>Patent Act</i> … is not an anti-competitive act”. See also <i>Director of Investigation and Research v.
    Warner Music of Canada Ltd.</i> (1997), 78 C.P.R. (3d) 321 (Comp. Trib.), at p.
    9 where, in discussing intellectual property rights, the tribunal stated that:
    “The right granted by Parliament to exclude others is fundamental to
    intellectual property rights and cannot be considered to be anti-competitive”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    the normal exercise of an intellectual property right is not an “abuse of
    dominance” under the <i>Competition Act</i>,
    Parliament was alive to the fact that those rights can be used
    inappropriately.  Section 32 of the <i>Act </i>gives the Federal Court broad
    remedial powers to address the use of intellectual property rights in ways that
    “unduly lessen” competition.  This
    reflects recognition that intellectual property rights can be used in
    unlawfully anti-competitive ways.  What
    then is the nature of a drug patent?  It

    1999 and 2003, GSK filed six NOC Proceedings in the Federal Court against
    several generic drug makers who sought to introduce a generic equivalent of
    Paxil into the Canadian market. None of the NOC Proceedings were successful.
    However, by virtue of the automatic stays that took effect upon their filing, GSK
    retained the exclusive right to market Paxil during the four years in question.</span></p>

    to the NOC Proceedings as “objectively baseless”, the appellant claims that GSK
    initiated them so that GSK could continue to charge consumers a
    “supra-competitive” price for Paxil. In doing so, GSK used the court process
    for an improper collateral purpose and caused damage to the class members – hence,
    the abuse of process claim.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    for the conspiracy claim, the appellant alleges that GSK engaged in a course of
    conduct, the predominant purpose of which was to cause injury to the class
    members by forcing them to pay a “supra-competitive” price for Paxil during the
    years 1999 to 2003. Alternatively, the appellant claims that GSK’s use of the
    regulatory NOC process was unlawful, it was directed at the class members, and GSK
    should have known in the circumstances that the class members would be injured,
    as indeed they were.</span></p>

    for the torts of conspiracy and abuse of process and, instead, to seek disgorgement
    of any profits made by GSK over the four-year period from 1999 to 2003.  In this regard, the appellant claims that
    GSK’s conduct constitutes an “affront to good conscience and require[s] a restitutionary
    disposition that will satisfy equity in the circumstances of this case as

    the tort of abuse of process as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    case law authorities establish that there are four constituent elements to the
    tort of abuse of process: (1) the plaintiff is a party to a legal process
    initiated by the defendant; (2) the legal process was initiated for the
    predominant purpose of furthering some indirect, collateral and improper
    objective; (3) the defendant took or made a definite act or threat in
    furtherance of the improper purpose; and (4) some measure of special damage has
    resulted: <i>Hawley v. Bapoo</i> (2005), 76

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judge correctly defined the
    elements of the tort of abuse of process. His conclusion finds support in
    academic writings and an established line of authorities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant referred to this court’s decision in <i>Metrick v. Deeb</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 2221,
    leave to appeal ref’d, <span class=ssl2>[</span><span class=hit>2003] S.C.C.A.
    No. 378</span> as authority for the proposition that the tort of abuse of
    process consists of only two elements: (1) using the legal process for an
    improper or collateral purpose; and (2) the need for a definite act or threat
    in furtherance of the illegitimate purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those two elements were taken from a passage in Fleming
    on Torts, 9th ed. (LBC: Sydney, 1998), at p. 668, which the court referred to
    as “instructive”. In its brief endorsement, the court directed its attention to
    the second of the two elements and found that it had not been made out on the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE><i>Metrick</i></span> should not be taken as authority for the proposition that the tort of abuse of process
    consists of only two elements. The court in that case was not called upon to
    consider the constituent elements of the tort. It was simply responding to the
    particular issues raised in that case, one of which related to the need for a
    definite act or threat in furtherance of the illegitimate purpose.  In that regard, the court found the following
    quote from Fleming instructive: “Some such overt conduct is essential, <i>because there is clearly no liability when
    the defendant merely employs regular legal process to its proper conclusion, albeit
    with bad intentions</i>” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we shall see, that principle is applicable to the
    case at hand, both as regards to the tort of abuse of process and also the tort
    of conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that the motion judge correctly
    identified the constituent elements of the tort of abuse of process, the
    appellant’s claim necessarily founders on the first element. In short, she was
    not a party to the NOC Proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addressing the first element of the tort, the motion
    judge explored what he referred to as the “many policy reasons” against eliminating
    it and extending the tort of abuse of process to non-parties. For present
    purposes, it is unnecessary to outline the policy reasons he explored. I only
    mention the fact that he considered policy matters because that is one of the complaints
    the appellant raises in support of her argument that the motion judge
    misidentified “mutuality” as one of the constituent elements of the tort of
    abuse of process. In short, the appellant submits that the motion judge was not
    entitled on a Rule&nbsp;21 motion, absent an evidentiary record, to consider
    policy matters. In doing so, he engaged in unwarranted speculation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. In the factum she filed on the motion, the
    appellant took the position that there were “no policy reasons for denying
    those persons [non-parties] the right to say that they were abused and to
    recover damages they have suffered as a result.” That being so, she cannot
    fault the motion judge for taking up the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, even if the appellant is correct
    that the motion judge should not have entered into the realm of policy, his
    doing so occasioned no harm. The constituent elements of the tort of abuse of
    process remain the same and the motion judge would have come to the same
    conclusion had he said nothing about policy considerations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also found that the third element of
    the tort of abuse of process was not made out on the pleadings. At para. 72 of
    his reasons, he made the following observations, with which I agree: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case at bar, based on
    the allegations pleaded in the statement of claim, there is no overt act
    outside of the alleged abusive process. From a reading of the statement of
    claim, all that can be said is that GSK made an application under s. 6 of the <i>NOC Regulations</i>, which automatically
    triggered the injunctive provisions of s. 7 of the regulation, which, in turn,
    delayed the entry of generic drugs into the market but exposed GSK to a claim
    under s. 8 of the regulation. Ms.&nbsp;Harris submits that the overt act
    outside the NOC Proceeding was GSK’s act of continuing to sell Paxil at
    supra-competitive prices, which is to say the act of selling at prices
    untouched by competition. That overt act, however, is not outside the NOC
    Proceedings. The act of bringing a NOC Proceeding is precisely the act of
    prohibiting competition so that sales may continue untouched by competition or
    at what Ms. Harris likes to call supra-competitive pricing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I am satisfied that the motion judge
    correctly determined that the tort of abuse of process was not made out on the
    pleadings.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conspiracy</span></h4>

    purpose must be to inflict harm on the plaintiff. It is not enough if harm is
    the collateral result of acts pursued predominantly out of self-interest. The
    focus is on the actual intent of the defendants and not on the consequences that
    the defendants either realized or should have realized would follow.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question to be answered, in
    determining whether a combination to do an act which damages others is
    actionable, even though it would not be actionable if done by a single person,
    is not “did the combiners appreciate, or should they be treated as
    appreciating, that others would suffer from their action,” but “what is the
    real reason why the combiners did it?” Or, as Lord Cave puts it, “what is the
    real purpose of the combination?” The test is not what is the natural result to
    the plaintiffs of such combined action, or what is the resulting damage which
    the defendants realize or should realize will follow, but what is in truth the
    object in the minds of the combiners when they acted as they did.</p>

    taken for the purpose of protecting a party’s trade or business interests
    amount to legitimate promotion of a self-interest and hence, do not give rise
    to the tort of conspiracy to injure:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the real purpose of a combination is not to
    injure the plaintiffs but to forward or defend the trade of those who enter
    into it, then no wrong is committed and no action will lie although damage to
    another ensues, provided that no resort is made to unlawful means in carrying
    out such purpose. An ordinary commercial transaction, the predominant <i>purpose of which is to advance economic
    interest, does not constitute a conspiracy even though the complaining party

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at hand, it is difficult to discern from
    the appellant’s pleading, what the appellant alleges was GSK’s predominant
    purpose in bringing the NOC Proceedings. Para. 57 of the amended statement of claim,
    reproduced in full below, reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Some, but not
    all, of the defendants’ predominant purposes, concerns, motivations and
    intentions</i> were to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       cause each of the Class Members to pay
    the Overcharge so that they would receive more income from the sale of Paxil than
    they would have if there was a generic equivalent for sale in Canada during the
    Class Period;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       suppress, delay and eliminate competition
    in the supply and sale of a generic equivalent in Canada in order to cause each
    of the Class Members to pay the Overcharge;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       maintain their monopoly in the sale of
    Paxil in order to maintain its supra-competitive price during the Class Period;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)       harm Class Members by requiring them to
    pay the Overcharge;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)       receive directly or indirectly increased
    revenue from the sale of Paxil; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(f)       <span class=GramE>avoid</span> detection
    and conceal the conspiracy from Tracey and the other Class Members and the
    regulatory authorities in Canada.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that there can be more than one “predominant”
    purpose, a cursory examination of paragraph 57 of the amended statement of
    claim shows that there is considerable overlap in five of the six alleged “predominant”
    purposes.  (Paragraph 57(f) is a non-sequitur.
     It relates to how the conspiracy was
    meant to operate.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stripping the five “predominant purpose” clauses to
    their essentials, the discernable predominant purpose would appear to be that
    GSK engaged in a course of conduct designed to obtain the highest possible
    price from consumers with a view to maximizing its revenue from the sale of Paxil
    – in other words, a classic commercial purpose that cannot amount to a
    conspiracy to injure even though, as a result, there is an economic impact on consumers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GSK submits that this is where the distinction between
    an anti-trust monopoly and the rights accruing to a patentee must be borne in
    mind. To the extent GSK’s predominant purpose in bringing the NOC Proceedings
    was to extend the patent rights it had enjoyed in relation to the sale of
    Paxil, GSK submits that that conduct could not amount to a conspiracy to
    injure. The <span class=GramE><i>PM(</i></span><i>NOC) Regulations</i> permitted GSK to do just
    that. GSK was entitled to defend the validity and scope of its patents. The
    fact that a patent confers on its owner the power to exclude others certainly has
    economic implications. But, as GSK points out, those implications are
    necessarily consequential and, in any event, intended by Parliament and thus
    not unlawfully anti-competitive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed through that lens, GSK submits, correctly in my view,
    that the appellant “cannot convert the legitimate interest of a patentee in
    protecting (and monetizing) its intellectual property rights into
    anti-competitive monopoly practices in order to conjure up the improper
    predominant purpose required for the tort of conspiracy.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge agreed with GSK’s submissions on this
    issue. At para. 86 of his reasons he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The resort to a NOC Proceeding is a part of the
    ordinary competition between innovators and generic manufacturers. The case law
    establishes that provided that there are no unlawful acts, an ordinary
    commercial transaction with the predominant purpose of advancing one’s own
    economic interests does not constitute a conspiracy even though a party or a
    third party may suffer an economic loss: [authorities omitted].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span class=GramE>And at para.</span> 89:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>GSK is not a public authority, a non-government
    organization, a charity, or a not-for-profit organization. It is a business
    enterprise with the purposeful activity of making money, which activity is not
    wrongdoing. As alleged in Ms.&nbsp;Harris’ statement of claim, all of GSK
    predominate purposes are connected to GSK advancing its own self-interest by
    making money, which is normal and a norm for for-profit enterprise. In my
    opinion, it is plain and obvious that Ms. Harris cannot establish an intent to
    injure simply from the fact that GSK continued to make money from her and from
    others by acting in its own self interest and availing itself of the statutory
    rights under s. 6 of the <i>NOC Regulations</i> to protect existing patents while exposing itself to the attendant statutory
    liability under s. 8 of the <i>NOC
    Regulations.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with those statements by the motion judge and
    would simply add that even if GSK acted with bad intentions in bringing the NOC
    Proceedings, as Fleming points out at para. 31 above, “there can be no
    liability when the defendant merely employs regular legal process to its proper
    conclusion”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(ii)<i>      Conspiracy to do an unlawful
    act</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge gave the appellant the widest possible
    berth in respect of this allegation. He tested her complaint against this
    court’s decision in <i>Reach</i> <i>M.D. Inc. v. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’
    Association of Canada</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 30, where Laskin J.A., for the
    court, held at paras. 52 and 53 that the concept of “illegal or unlawful means”
    is broad enough to include the doing of an act that the person or entity is “not
    authorized to do” or “at liberty to commit”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying that test to the case at hand, the motion
    judge stated the following at para. 94 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case at bar, GSK’s NOC Proceedings were not
    contrary to law or to statute. GSK’s NOC Proceedings were the opposite of
    unauthorized; they were proceedings that GSK was entitled to bring. In other
    words, they were acts that GSK was at liberty to commit. The NOC Proceedings
    are actually a response to NOC’s initiated by <span class=SpellE>Apotex</span> and two other generic manufacturers. GSK has a statutory right to show that the
    generic manufacturer’s allegations are “not justified.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the motion judge’s characterization of
    GSK’s conduct. It follows that the pleadings do not substantiate a conspiracy
    based on unlawful means. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     <i>The sham litigation
    argument</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having determined that the appellant’s abuse of process
    and conspiracy allegations could not stand, the motion judge went on to
    consider the six cases in which GSK had commenced NOC Proceedings. Of those six
    cases, four were determined on their merits<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and, in each instance, the courts found in favour of the generic manufacturers.
    GSK had failed to establish that all of the allegations set out by the generic
    manufacturers in their NOAs were unjustified. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge analyzed the four decisions, although
    he was not asked to do so by the parties. He did so because the appellant, in
    her submissions, had characterized the NOC Proceedings instituted by GSK as
    “frivolous”, “meritless”, “sham litigation”, “spurious”, and “objectively
    baseless”. In the opinion of the motion judge, it was those allegations that
    form “the lynchpin allegations of all of the claims against GSK”. With that in
    mind, the motion judge analyzed the four decisions in which GSK was
    unsuccessful and at para. 105 of his reasons, he stated, “[I]n my opinion, it
    is plain and obvious that these allegations are patently ridiculous and
    incapable of proof.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that it was wrong for the motion
    judge to analyze the four decisions on his own motion.  Of greater importance, she submits that it was
    not open to the motion judge on a Rule 21 motion to find, based on his review
    of the four decisions, that the appellant’s “sham litigation” allegations were “patently
    ridiculous and incapable of proof”. According to the appellant, that finding,
    which exceeded the scope of the motion judge’s mandate, coloured his perception
    of the appellant’s claims and tainted his analysis of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellant in part. In my view, it was
    open to the motion judge to look at the four decisions since they formed part
    of the record before him. I further think he was entitled, based on his review
    of those decisions, to conclude that the NOC Proceedings were not, on their
    face, sham proceedings. What he could not do, in my respectful view, was to use
    them to conclude that the plaintiff’s allegations to the opposite effect “were
    patently ridiculous and incapable of proof.” That finding could only be made on
    a full record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I am satisfied that the motion judge’s error
    was harmless. His findings in relation to the four decisions are obiter. They
    form no part of the analysis that led him to conclude, correctly in my view,
    that the pleadings as framed disclose no viable cause of action against GSK in
    tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this aspect of
    the appellant’s argument.</p>
  <h4><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>(iv)      <i>Waiver</i></span></span><i><span lang=EN-US> of tort</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 102 of his reasons, the motion judge dismissed
    the waiver of tort claim because, in his view, “it is plain and obvious that
    there is no predicate wrongdoing upon which to base a plea of waiver of tort”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding that there must be a predicate wrongdoing
    to substantiate “waiver of tort”, the motion judge relied on this court’s
    decision in <i>Aronowicz v. Emtwo Properties
    Inc.</i>, 2010 ONCA 96, where Blair J.A. stated at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    82, “Whether the claim [waiver of tort] exists as an independent cause of
    action or whether it requires proof of all the elements of an underlying tort
    aside, <i>at the very least, waiver of tort
    requires some form of wrongdoing</i>” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the motion judge’s analysis and
    conclusion. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge determined that the amended statement
    of claim disclosed no viable cause of action against GSK. Hence, he concluded
    that it was the plain and obvious that the action against GSK could not
    succeed. I agree. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties are not seeking costs. Accordingly, there
    will be no order as to costs.</p>
