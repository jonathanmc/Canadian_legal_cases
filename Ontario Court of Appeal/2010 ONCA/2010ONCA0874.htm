  <p><b>I.          OVERVIEW </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant,
    Donald Earhart, appeals from his conviction for the first degree murder of
    Ronald Sullivan.  His argument focuses on
    evidence of his bad character that was adduced by his co-accused, Ronald
    Kirk.  He contends that in the unusual
    circumstances of this case, the fact that the jury had this evidence available
    to them for their deliberations, coupled with problems with certain related
    aspects of the jury charge, resulted in his being denied a fair trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Sullivan was
    last seen alive during the night of October 14 and early morning of October 15,
    2004.  On the night of his disappearance,
    he had been observed in the company of Earhart, his girlfriend, T.D., and his
    cousin, Kirk.  Sullivan’s mother reported
    him missing on October 19, 2004.  His
    remains were located on April 26, 2005.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Crown
    charged both Earhart and Kirk with first degree murder.  The two were tried together.  In the month-long trial, the Crown’s case centred
    on the potential liability of each of the two men. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk’s defence was that Earhart killed Sullivan and did
    so, unassisted.  In his testimony he
    admitted that he was with Earhart when the killing took place.  However, he said, he took no steps then, or
    during the evening leading up to Sullivan’s death, to aid in the commission of
    the murder.  Alternatively, Kirk took the
    position that if the jury were to find that he did assist Earhart, he did so
    under duress from Earhart. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart neither testified nor called evidence on his
    own behalf.  His defence was that the
    main witnesses were unreliable and the case for the Crown did not establish
    beyond a reasonable doubt that he participated in the murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 18, 2008, the jury returned a verdict of
    guilty of first degree murder in the case of Earhart and not guilty in the case
    of Kirk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his factum, counsel for Earhart identified nine
    instances of bad character evidence, elicited by Kirk that the jury was allowed
    to hear. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He had scalded T.D.’s young son; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He beat T.D. viciously and repeatedly; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He had prior unspecified dealings with the Children’s’
    Aid Society; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iv.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His own family was frightened of him; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>v.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He provoked fights with Davey’s neighbours and was
    prepared to bring a gun to the fights; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>vi.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He had killed before and been on trial for murder
    before; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>vii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He kept a baseball bat with nails in it in Kirk’s
    apartment; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>viii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He had committed many crimes including break and enters
    and assaulting police officers and had a bad criminal record; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ix.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was a frightening man who, for no apparent reason,
    threatened people. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The trial judge
    admitted this evidence on a number of bases including that Kirk was mounting a
    “cut-throat” defence that it was Earhart, not he, who killed Sullivan.  However, at the conclusion of the evidence,
    the Crown advised the trial judge that he was no longer taking the position
    that Kirk was a principal to the offence of murder as there was no evidence to
    support that position.  The Crown was
    therefore going to argue to the jury that it was Earhart who had killed Sullivan
    and that the jury should only find Kirk guilty of murder on the basis that, by
    assisting Earhart, he was a party to the offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal Earhart submits that this change of position
    resulted in the jury’s being left with a substantial amount of highly
    prejudicial evidence that had little or no probative value to the issues the
    jury ultimately had to decide.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will focus on the evidence <span lang=EN-US>of two women that Earhart told each of them he
    had killed before (the “impugned evidence”). </span>While I do not suggest that
    the rest of the bad character evidence was only trivial in terms of its
    prejudice, the impugned evidence was by far the most prejudicial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the analysis that follows, I conclude that the
    charge to the jury was confusing in relation to Kirk’s potential criminal
    liability.  Furthermore, I am of the view
    that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury with respect to the
    bad character evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, while in my view the jury was not properly
    instructed in a number of respects, the Crown’s case against Earhart was
    formidable—sufficiently so that I would apply the curative proviso and dismiss
    the appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        UNDERLYING FACTS </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of the central issue Earhart raises on
    this appeal, the admission of bad character evidence, I find it necessary to
    provide a rather lengthy summary of that aspect of the evidence and the trial
    chronology, including the charge, in order to explain the circumstances
    surrounding the admission of the impugned evidence and the instructions the
    jury was given as to the ways in which it could and could not be used.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Events of the Night of October
    14, 2004</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following summary of what transpired on the night
    when Sullivan was killed comes primarily from the testimony of Kirk, T.D. and
    members of Kirk’s family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evening of October 14, 2004, began with Earhart and
    Kirk driving around and smoking crack.  They were periodically accompanied by two women - Melissa Davey and
    T.D.  With them, they had a gun belonging
    to Earhart.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At one point, Earhart called Sullivan and arranged to
    meet him at a Burger King.  Sullivan, who
    arrived with two other men, agreed to go off with Earhart, Kirk and T.D.  As the four drove around, Earhart became increasingly
    angry at Sullivan.  In addition to
    confronting him about some allegedly adulterated crack he had sold him, Earhart
    was enraged over the fact that Sullivan had come to meet him in the company of
    the other men.  He thought that Sullivan
    had tried to “set him up”.  On numerous
    occasions during the evening, Earhart violently assaulted Sullivan, both inside
    and outside of the car.  After all four
    smoked some crack, Earhart made Sullivan take off his shirt, jacket and shoes
    and get into the front seat beside him.  Earhart drove off with the gun in his lap, pointed at Sullivan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk testified that as the group continued to drive
    around, Earhart’s ire increased.  In
    addition to his growing rage against Sullivan, he was angry at Kirk for running
    low on gas.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually the group ended up at the house of Linda
    Wein, an aunt to both Earhart and Kirk.  By this time, Sullivan had been blindfolded.  Earhart woke Wein up to ask her for gas.  Wein testified that Earhart told her “he was
    upset ... Ron [Kirk] was suppose to take them to somebody’s house and that he
    was going to kick the f’in shit out of him [Kirk]” and that he had been in a
    fight earlier with someone in his car, and he “beat the crap out of him.”  She testified that Earhart was very angry
    when he left. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still in search of gas, the group proceeded to the
    house of B.K., a relative of both Kirk’s and Earhart’s, still in search of
    gas.  Both B.K. and her son P.K.
    testified that Earhart took a blindfolded man to the side of the house and
    repeatedly beat him.  Kirk, in response
    to shouted demands from Earhart, brought the gun to him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually, Earhart drove off with Kirk and Sullivan.  T.D. stayed with B.K.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk testified that the three men stopped at a bush lot
    where Earhart pulled Sullivan out of the car and yelled at him to remove the
    rest of his clothing.  Earhart shouted to
    Kirk to “get the fuck over here.  Bring
    me the fuckin’ gun.”  When Kirk got out
    of the car, he saw Earhart and Sullivan fighting and pushing.  He then saw Earhart “just slit his
    throat”.  Sullivan fell to the ground and
    Earhart stabbed him again in the stomach area.  Kirk helped Earhart pull Sullivan into the bush.  Sullivan started gurgling and Earhart stabbed
    him twice more.  They covered Sullivan
    with branches.  Earhart told Kirk that if
    anyone found out, Kirk and his mother would be hurt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk and Earhart returned to B.K.’s house.  They had blood on their hands and
    clothing.  B.K. asked where the other man
    was and Earhart said that he beat him up and he had run away.  T.D., who was still at B.K.’s house,
    testified that Earhart told her that this was “his messiest kill yet”.  Kirk made a gesture to his throat and a
    gurgling sound.  Earhart and Kirk changed,
    borrowing clothes from one of Kirk’s relatives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart and Kirk left together, looking for drugs.  They threw Sullivan’s clothes into a field
    and disposed of the gun in a ditch.  Later that day, on Earhart’s instructions, T.D. cleaned the car and got
    rid of a cell phone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Earhart’s Arrest</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police commenced an investigation when Sullivan’s
    mother reported him missing.  Upon being
    interviewed by the police, T.D. made statements that were favourable to
    Earhart.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then, in early 2005, T.D. went to the police, recanted
    her previous story and provided the police with statements that incriminated
    Earhart.  In April 2005, on the basis of
    T.D.’s new statements and an extensive police investigation, the police found Sullivan’s
    body and arrested Earhart and Kirk on the charge of first degree murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Statements Made After the Killing</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Various witnesses testified about statements Earhart
    made after Sullivan went missing.  One of
    these was V.S., a friend of Sullivan’s who was living in his house.  Her evidence, supported by T.D., was that on
    October 15, Earhart went to Sullivan’s house and asked where Sullivan was,
    claiming that he owed him money arising out of a drug deal.  T.D. testified that Earhart instructed her to
    tell people that after they left Davey’s house that night, they went home and
    had sex.  He also told her that he thought
    he should kill Kirk, because Kirk was going to crack.  Davey testified that when it became apparent
    Sullivan was missing, Earhart told her he had just received a phone call from
    Sullivan and that he was in jail.  P.K.’s
    evidence was that he was afraid to go to the police and tell them what he knew
    because Earhart had said to him “say anything, you’ll see what happens”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk testified that, during the various court
    proceedings and while they were incarcerated, Earhart personally and through
    his father, repeatedly threatened him and his family if Kirk did not “get on
    the same page” and “shut up”.   </p>
  <p><b>The Admission of the
    Impugned Evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>T.D. was the eighth witness called on behalf of the
    prosecution.  After she testified in
    chief, Kirk’s counsel made submissions to the trial judge that, during his
    cross-examination of T.D., he intended to elicit bad character evidence
    regarding Earhart on the basis that this evidence was relevant in three
    respects. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it was relevant to the jury’s determination of
    whether Kirk had raised a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the one who
    killed Sullivan - the “cut-throat” defence.  Counsel submitted as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Y]ou heard [T.D.’s] evidence that at some point
    Donny Earhart, Ron Kirk, with Ron Sullivan, leave [B.K.’s] house and the two of
    them come back without Ron Sullivan.  So,
    what happens in that vacuum, who knows at this particular point in time, but
    one of the purposes for propensity, bad character type of evidence is to
    establish or at least create a reasonable doubt as to which of the two did
    commit that murder ...  the court would
    have to instruct the jury that that type of evidence would not be proof that
    Mr. Earhart did it.  But, it can raise a
    reasonable doubt as far as Mr. Kirk is concerned....</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk’s counsel further argued that the evidence would
    be relevant to Kirk’s defence of duress:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And, also duress could be argued in this case and
    we hear that from T.D.’s evidence herself where she says at some point during
    that trip the focus seemed to turn away from Ron Sullivan and turn on Mr. Kirk
    and she says Mr. Kirk had the gun put in his face at some point and his life
    was threatened.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, defence counsel argued that the evidence of
    Earhart’s propensity for violence was relevant to T.D.’s credibility.  It helped establish her fear of Earhart
    which, in turn, could be used to explain her inconsistent versions of the
    events that she gave to the police:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would be my intention to bring out on
    cross-examination, your honour, that at the time T.D. gave I think seven
    statements to the police.  The first two
    I think were not true and then the third one she’s starting to, I think, say
    something similar to what she’s trying to say here in court.  But, before she gave that statement to the
    police she inquired about her safety, her son’s safety, her mother’s safety, in
    relation to Mr. Earhart, and I think any friends or associates, family
    etc.  T.D. is certainly, you know,
    intimately connected to this whole – whole incident.  I’d be asking T.D. – like she’s participated
    in things, for example, washing blood off Donny Earhart, cleaning out that car
    thoroughly ... and the reason why she did it in my submissions I would like to
    bring out in cross-examination is that, she has felt controlled, intimidated,
    and manipulated by Donny Earhart throughout that five to six year relationship
    as a result of physical – and not only physical abuse but emotional abuse by
    Donny Earhart over five or six years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On these three bases, the trial judge and all counsel
    agreed that propensity evidence in relation to Earhart was relevant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It followed that, apart from two instances in which the
    trial judge excluded reputation evidence and hearsay, all of the bad character
    evidence was admitted without further argument or consideration by the trial
    judge. This evidence, including the impugned evidence, was adduced through the
    testimony of a number of witnesses including Davey, Jurevicius, T.D., Wein and
    Kirk.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Change in the Crown’s
    Position</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of all of the evidence, Crown counsel
    advised the trial judge that his position concerning Kirk’s potential
    involvement in Sullivan’s killing had changed.  Crown counsel submitted that the evidence demonstrated that there was
    only “one principal,” Earhart, and as the trial judge suggested, reference to
    “killers” in the plural, should be removed from the charge.  He submitted that, from Kirk’s various
    statements such as “we’ve gotta do this, we’ve gotta take care of this” and his
    role in holding the gun, there was sufficient evidence that Kirk had aided in
    the murder.  However, there was “simply
    no evidence that they [Earhart and Kirk] did it together.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Kirk agreed with the Crown’s change of
    position.  Earhart’s counsel made no
    submissions on the turn of events.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Closing Submissions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Focusing on Kirk and T.D., Earhart’s counsel reviewed
    the testimony of witnesses that potentially implicated Earhart, setting out
    reasons why those witnesses ought not to be believed.  She argued that Kirk’s evidence was
    particularly suspect due to his predictably strong motivation to implicate
    Earhart as the killer.  With respect to
    T.D., Earhart’s counsel pointed out that during the investigation, T.D. had
    made 12 statements to the police containing a number of admitted lies.  Counsel drove the point home by asking the
    members of the jury the following rhetorical question: “How are we supposed to
    know what part is the truth and what part is a lie?” She also mounted a strong
    challenge to the credibility of other Crown witnesses, identifying, among other
    things, inconsistencies in their evidence and their close relationships with
    Kirk.  The straight-forward defence
    advanced on behalf of Earhart was that given the prosecution witnesses were
    unworthy of belief; the Crown had failed to prove its case against Earhart
    beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart’s counsel made a specific plea for the jury to ignore
    any evidence of Earhart’s bad character:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And, ladies and gentlemen, finally, you’ve heard
    bits and pieces of information about Donald Earhart’s character.  Various people have suggested that they
    didn’t like Mr. Earhart for one reason or another and that he is a person of
    bad character.  And, ladies and
    gentlemen, you’re not being asked to decide whether or not Mr. Earhart is or is
    not a nice person.  You may think that he
    is, you may think he’s not, you may not know.  You may not have enough information to make that decision.  However, in deciding whether the Crown has
    proven their case against Mr. Earhart beyond a reasonable doubt you must put
    that out of your mind.  You must not
    decide the case on the basis of saying, well, Mr. Earhart does not seem to be a
    nice person and therefore he must be guilty.  His Honour will tell you more about this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of his closing submissions, counsel for
    Kirk repeatedly suggested that Earhart’s lawyer had not taken the position that
    it was Kirk who killed Sullivan.  It
    followed, he argued, that Earhart must have.  Like Earhart’s counsel, he emphasized the point by way of a rhetorical
    question: “My friend gets up and she questions the credibility of a lot of
    these witnesses, but she’s not pointing the finger at Mr. Kirk ... And I say to
    you, if it wasn’t Mr. Kirk, then who else?  Who else?”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk’s counsel focused his argument on a review of the
    evidence that would support Kirk’s defence of duress.  He referred to evidence given by a number of
    witnesses who saw the men together during the period just prior to the killing,
    relating to Earhart’s threats toward and mistreatment of Kirk.  And he referred to Kirk’s testimony about how
    Earhart treated him as the events leading to Sullivan’s death unfolded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk’s counsel also spent considerable time on the bad
    character evidence adduced against Earhart, including statements Earhart had
    allegedly made about himself.  In
    particular, he focused on the evidence of T.D. that Earhart had told her “this
    is my messiest kill yet” and on Jurevicius’s testimony that he had bragged to
    her about having killed before:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So, this is my messiest kill yet.  Now, why would the word ‘yet’ be in
    there?  My messiest kill yet.  That’s a nice word to have in there, because
    recall that Krista Jurevicius, however you pronounce her name, you know who I’m
    talking about, Krista Jurevicius, she says and I’m going to reference her
    testimony a little bit but I just want to look at an aspect of it, she says –
    and there’s no doubt in your mind who’s running in the house, tearing their
    shirt off.  It was Donny Earhart.  But, she says he says, you don’t know who I
    am.  ...  you don’t know who I am but he also says, I’ve killed two people.  He said that.  He said, I’ve been in the penitentiary.  And, [T.D.] tells us that he told her he killed people, she mentioned a
    number of 16.  But, [T.D.] also said that
    Donny Earhart told her at one point that if he was going to kill somebody he’d
    go for the neck and that’s what we’ve got in this particular case.  So, when you look at the word ‘messy’ when
    you look at the word ‘yet’, yet means – you know would tell you, oh, he’s
    probably killed some people, so it goes to support those two statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown summarized, relatively briefly, the evidence
    of the key witnesses, namely Kirk and T.D., in support of his position that the
    evidence demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Earhart factually caused
    Sullivan’s death and, in law, should be found guilty of first degree
    murder.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s theory with respect to Kirk was that he was
    a willing participant with Earhart in the entire transaction, beginning with
    the abuse of Sullivan in the car and ending with Sullivan’s death.  Crown counsel argued that Kirk had assisted
    Earhart by periodically driving the car, by blindfolding Sullivan, by holding
    Sullivan down, by retrieving the gun for Earhart, and finally by pointing the gun
    at Sullivan about 20 feet from the final struggle during which Sullivan was
    killed. According to the Crown, “Ron Kirk’s presence with the gun in these
    circumstances viewed objectively could be considered a substantial assistance
    to Don Earhart in committing the murder and another example of Ron Kirk backing
    up his cousin.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown made it clear to the jury that the
    prosecution was no longer taking the position that Kirk was guilty as a
    principal to the offence of murder in the sense that Kirk was the one who
    committed the act that led to Sullivan’s death.   The Crown’s position as to Kirk’s potential criminal
    responsibility rested solely in his being a party. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argued that the defence of duress was not
    available to Kirk.  He urged the jury to
    conclude that Kirk went along with Earhart due to the strength of their
    relationship as friends and cousins.  He
    asked the jury to consider the number of occasions when Kirk could have removed
    himself from the situation that was building during the evening of October 14
    and early morning of the 15th.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown next turned to Kirk’s criminal culpability,
    assuming the jury concluded that he acted under his own free will.  The Crown said: “[i]t’s the position of the
    Crown that there is evidence in this case to support the guilt of Ron Kirk on
    first degree murder, not as a principal but as someone who assisted the
    principal”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown then proceeded to review the possible
    verdicts against Kirk—guilty of first degree murder, second degree murder or
    manslaughter—telling them that any one of the three verdicts was available to
    them on the basis that Kirk assisted in the killing but did not actually kill
    Sullivan.  That said, the Crown urged the
    jury to return a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Jury Charge </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Kirk
    – principal or aider or party</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge instructed the jury as to both
    possibilities relating to Kirk’s criminal culpability leading to a verdict of
    guilty of first degree murder – that Kirk was the actual killer or, by
    assisting Earhart, was a party to the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, the trial judge advised the jury that he
    had prepared two decision trees for their assistance.  The first was the ‘perpetrator’ decision tree
    and the second was the ‘party’ decision tree.  The trial judge explained to the jury that if they found that one of the
    co-accused was the perpetrator, then they would move to the second decision
    tree in order to determine if the other co-accused was a party.  The first question on the ‘perpetrator’ tree,
    as described by the trial judge, was:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Did Mr. Earhart or Mr. Kirk, by an unlawful act,
    cause the death of Ronald Sullivan?  ...  [T]he first step in this case
    is to decide whether beyond a reasonable doubt that we have in this courtroom
    ... in the form of Mr. Earhart or Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sullivan’s killer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the various parts of the trial judge’s
    instructions to the jury that it was open to them to find Kirk guilty as a
    principal to Sullivan’s murder, the trial judge also provided strong direction
    to the contrary.  I refer to one passage
    in which he instructed the jury that “in this case ... all the evidence points
    away from Mr. Kirk as the killer or the principal.  If you think Mr. Kirk is guilty of any
    criminal offence in this case, it may <i>only</i> be on the basis of the evidence that we have heard, as a party to the offence”
    (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge actually went further and expressed his
    own unequivocal opinion that there was no evidence that Kirk participated in
    killing Sullivan, in a physical way.  He
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I can think of no evidence in this case that Mr.
    Kirk by a physical act became an essential, substantial or integral part of the
    knife attack and so Mr. Sullivan’s death, and I haven’t heard anybody suggest
    anything.  Now, the decision is for you
    to make but I can <u>think of no evidence.  None.</u>  [Emphasis added.]<u></u></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Bad
    character evidence in relation to Earhart  </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the uses to which the propensity evidence could
    be put, the trial judge gave three distinct instructions to the jury.  They involved the potential relevance of the
    evidence to T.D.’s credibility, to Kirk’s defence of duress and to whether Kirk
    or Earhart was the actual killer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, with respect to T.D.’s credibility, the trial
    judge charged the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In assessing what weight or importance you will
    give to the evidence of [T.D.] you may reasonably take these inconsistencies
    and her admission to lying to the police into account.  You may as well take into account her
    explanation for the difficulties with her statements and why she lied to the
    police.  She explained that what she told
    the police initially is what Mr. Earhart told her to say and that in the first
    two statements she was covering up for him. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>T.D.’s evidence was that at the beginning she
    followed Mr. Earhart’s instructions to cover up for him.  She had been in an abusive relationship with
    him which involved control and manipulation.  She gave examples of assaultive behaviour by Mr. Earhart.  She was frightened of Mr. Earhart, she told
    us.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also instructed the jury on how
    Earhart’s propensity for violence could be used with respect to Kirk’s defence
    of duress:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to Mr. Kirk’s state of mind and what
    he might reasonably expect of Mr. Earhart at that point [of the alleged
    murder], you may take into account the belligerence – the history of
    belligerence and threats to Mr. Kirk through October 14<sup>th</sup> and into
    the early hours of October 15.  That
    evidence is lengthy and included Mr. Kirk’s description of Mr. Earhart shoving
    the gun into his face when Mr. Kirk argued with Mr. Earhart about going to
    B.K.’s residence, and the evidence that the gun had been fired earlier in the
    evening.  You may as well take into
    account the evidence of T.D., B.K. and P.K. with respect to Mr. Earhart’s
    behaviour to Mr. Kirk and the effect of the behaviour on Mr. Kirk that they
    observed.  There is evidence as well,
    that the level of Mr. Earhart’s agitation and assaultive behaviour increased as
    the night wore on, and that Mr. Kirk experienced or watched this on the trip
    north, at Huron Park and the home of [B.K.].  You may as well take into account Mr. Kirk’s understanding of Mr.
    Earhart’s disposition to violence in considering Mr. Kirk’s state of mind and
    how he would react to Mr. Earhart, whether he would believe that any threat
    might be carried out by Mr. Earhart. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the question of who, as between Earhart
    and Kirk, had killed Sullivan, the trial judge told the jury that the evidence
    could be used to raise a reasonable doubt about Kirk’s involvement as principal
    but could not be used to support the inference that Earhart was the killer: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, you have heard evidence with respect
    to Mr. Earhart’s disposition or propensity for violence so I want to instruct
    you specifically on how you can use this evidence in considering the case of
    Mr. Kirk and how you must not use the evidence in considering the case of Mr.
    Earhart.  Firstly the use to which Mr. Kirk
    may make use of such evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Such evidence may assist you in deciding whether
    the Crown has proven its case against Mr. Kirk.  So you may take such evidence into account in deciding whether Mr. Kirk
    committed the offence, because Mr. Earhart’s propensity to commit the offence
    charged may raise a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kirk committed the offence or
    convince you that he was not involved.  So it is really nothing more than a piece of circumstantial evidence which
    may form the basis of a finding that he did not commit the offence charged or
    that there is a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kirk committed the crime charged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Secondly, the use to which such evidence must not
    be put in considering the case of Mr. Earhart:  You must not use such evidence to decide that Mr. Earhart committed the
    offence of murder because he is the sort of person who would likely do so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is a fundamental rule of our criminal justice
    system that criminal responsibility depends on the Crown’s ability to prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the act of murder set out
    in the indictment.  Mr. Earhart is not on
    trial for past misconduct or misconduct which followed the alleged event.  He is being tried only for the events of
    October 14th and 15th.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So, to summarize, you may use the evidence of Mr.
    Earhart’s propensity for violence to help you decide that in fact, Mr. Kirk did
    not commit the offence or there must be in your minds, is the position of Mr.
    Kirk, reasonable doubt that Mr. Kirk committed the offence of murder or helped
    in its commission.  You must not use this
    evidence, however, as I say, to help you decide that Mr. Earhart committed the
    offence charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge immediately went on to highlight
    examples of the bad character evidence, including the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some of the evidence on Mr. Earhart’s propensity or
    disposition for violence is the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Krista Jurevicius, at Donald [<i>sic</i>] Sullivan’s house, Mr. Earhart told her that he had killed two
    people and been to penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T.D.], over the time they were together, Mr.
    Earhart hit her with a bat and belt and struck her shins with a crow bar.  ...  He
    told her that he had killed before.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly, later in the charge, the trial judge
    returned to the issue of Earhart’s bad character evidence and instructed as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is evidence in this case of Donald Earhart’s
    disposition to violence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is an absence of such evidence in Mr.
    Kirk.  As I have instructed you over the
    use of such evidence it may be used to decide as between the two men, who is
    more likely to have attacked Ronald Sullivan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were no objections to the charge.   The jury asked only one question.  After three hours of deliberation the jury
    asked the following question: “Can you review again for us in Decision Tree 2,
    the definition of aiding and abetting, party to the offence?”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An hour and a half after the question was answered, the

    which Kirk’s counsel elicited the impugned testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During Jurevicius’s cross-examination by counsel for
    Kirk, the following discussion took place: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q:  ... Now, I understand that on that evening
    you were at Ron Sullivan’s house and this person, Little Don or Don Earhart,
    came in down the hall to the kitchen taking his shirt off, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q:  And he stated, “Don’t you know who I am?” ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q:  ... correct?  And I take it that not only did he say, “Don’t you know who I am,” he
    also said that he killed two people?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q:  What was that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q:  You recall him saying that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q:  And that he had been in the penitentiary?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q:  And that was as he came in in that aggressive
    rage, taking his shirt off, you know, sort of charging up to Ron Sullivan?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury heard similar evidence from T.D., also
    elicited by Kirk’s counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:  But you
    don’t remember Donny saying anything about he stabbed the guy in the neck?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:  No, I
    don’t know if I just assumed that or if he actually said it.  What I do know is that through all the years
    I was with Donny, he always said that that was how he would kill someone.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:  That was
    how he would kill someone?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:  And I
    take it from your testimony in cross-examination, at one point you said that
    he’s told you that he’s killed somebody?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:  Yes, he
    told me killed 16 people.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:  Oh, he
    told you he killed 16?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:  And did
    he mention who they were?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:  No.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these passages, each of Jurevicius and T.D. are
    testifying about what someone else told them.  Because the ‘someone else’ is Earhart himself, the evidence falls within
    the ‘admissions by a party’ exception to the rule against hearsay.  There was no issue as to the necessity and
    reliability of this evidence and therefore, from a hearsay perspective, it was
    admissible for the truth of its contents:  see <i>R. v. Mapara</i>, [2005] 1
    S.C.R. 358 at para. 34.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The meaning that could be
    attributed to the impugned evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to distinguish between what the jury
    could take from the impugned evidence and what use they could make of it.  The former I will refer to as the “meaning”
    of the evidence. The meaning was for the jury to decide, although, as discussed
    at paras. 106-107 below, in my view, it was incumbent on the trial judge to
    give them some direction in this regard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The meaning the jury could assign to the impugned
    evidence depended on the answers to a series of questions.  First, they had to determine whether they
    believed the testimony of each of T.D. and Jurevicius that Earhart told them he
    had killed before.  Assuming they
    believed one or both of the witnesses, the jury then had to decide whether or
    not Earhart was telling the truth when he made those statements.  If they decided that he was, then it was open
    to them to conclude that Earhart had in fact killed before.  If they decided that he was not telling the
    truth, then they could conclude that he was bragging, or simply trying to
    intimidate, or lying for some other reason.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The use that could be made of the impugned evidence depended
    to some degree on what meaning the jury took from it.  If they concluded that it demonstrated that Earhart
    had in fact killed before, the testimony of T.D. and Jurevicius was powerful
    evidence of Earhart’s bad character.  If
    they concluded that he was simply bragging, in such an extraordinary way, the
    evidence also demonstrates bad character but arguably not of the same degree of
    seriousness.  Either way, the impugned
    evidence is relevant; but the former interpretation carries significantly more
    prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless, given the charge contained no instructions
    in relation to the meaning of the evidence, and in the light of the final
    argument of Kirk’s counsel set out in para. 40 above, it must be assumed, for
    the purposes of considering Earhart’s fair trial rights, that the jury took the
    evidence at its highest and concluded that he had killed before.<b>  </b></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order for any evidence to be admitted at trial, it
    must first be found to be relevant to a material issue.  For the majority of evidence adduced,
    relevance will be obvious, but in some cases a more careful analysis is
    required.  If evidence is relevant, then
    the focus turns to an assessment of whether there is any reason not to admit it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This latter step is particularly important when
    considering bad character evidence.  As
    will be explained below, different tests relating to admissibility apply
    depending on whether the evidence is led by the Crown or by a co-accused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Character evidence, though relevant, is always
    inherently prejudicial.  Its relevance
    comes from the view that “[t]he tendency or disposition of a person to do a
    certain act is relevant to indicate the probability of his doing or not doing
    the act”:  <i>R. v. McMillan</i> (1975), 7 O.R. (2d) 750 (C.A.) at p. 757, aff’d
    [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824.  The inherent
    prejudice flows from the natural human tendency to judge a person’s actions on
    the basis of character.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concern over prejudice is two-fold.  First, a jury might “infer guilt from general
    disposition or propensity”: <i>R. v. Handy</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at para. 139.  This
    error is commonly referred to as “moral prejudice”.   Second, there is a distracting nature to
    character evidence, creating what has been called a “reasoning prejudice”.  Rather than focusing the trial on whether the
    Crown has proven the charges, propensity evidence risks distracting a jury with
    details of other criminal conduct:  <i>Handy</i> at paras. 144-46; see also <i>R. v. Pollock</i> (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d)
    213 (Ont. C.A.) at paras. 99-102.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of this high and inherent prejudice, evidence
    of the bad character of the accused is presumptively inadmissible when led by
    the Crown.  In <i>Handy,</i> at para. 36, Binnie J., citing several recent cases,
    summarized the position of the Supreme Court with respect to this evidence,
    saying:  “[t]he exclusion of evidence of
    general propensity or disposition has been repeatedly affirmed in this Court
    and is not controversial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The situation is different, however, when one accused
    seeks to lead evidence of the bad character of a co-accused, in cases where
    what is known as a “cut-throat” defence is raised by one of the accused against
    the other.  This is where two accused are
    jointly tried, each with equal opportunity to commit the crime and each
    alleging that the other committed it:  see <i>R. v. Suzack </i>(2000), <span
class=ssl21><span style='line-height:200%'>141 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 72.  In this scenario, one accused may be
    permitted to lead propensity evidence against the other accused on the basis of
    his or her right to make full answer and defence, even though the Crown would
    not be permitted to lead such evidence:  see <i>Suzack </i>at para. 111.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in <i>Suzack</i>,
    at para. 116, Doherty J.A. cautions that even in cases where the cut-throat
    defence is in play, care must be taken not to “discard a rule that is so
    fundamental to an accused’s right to a fair trial”, namely, the rule that the
    Crown cannot make its case by showing the accused’s propensity to commit the
    crime with which he or she is charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Pollock</i>,
    at para. 106, Rosenberg J.A. spoke of the “very grave risk of prejudice”
    associated with the admission of bad character evidence, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… [S]ince evidence of propensity or bad character
    can carry a very grave risk of prejudice to the fair trial of the accused
    against whom the evidence is led, it is incumbent on the trial judge to examine
    closely the probative value of the evidence and the purposes for which the
    evidence is tendered.  In my view, in a
    joint trial, counsel’s mere assertion that the evidence is necessary for the
    accused to make full answer and defence is not sufficient given the grave
    potential for prejudice to the fair trial of a co-accused.  There must be some evidentiary foundation to
    support this assertion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the direction from these authorities is
    this.  Propensity evidence, while
    inherently prejudicial, may be led by a co-accused so long as the prejudicial
    effect of that evidence does not clearly outweigh its probative value.  This is a lower threshold of admissibility
    than is applied to character evidence led by the Crown, where the prejudicial
    effect need only outweigh the probative value for the evidence to be rendered
    inadmissible:  see <i>Pollock</i> at paras. 110, 123.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite these differing standards, the concern over
    prejudice is the same.  When bad
    character evidence becomes potentially admissible, the trial judge, after going
    through the analysis mandated by <i>Pollock</i>,
    has the discretion whether to admit the evidence.  Its admission is not automatic and the trial
    judge must engage in a careful and explicit balancing of probative value and
    prejudicial effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the trial judge concludes the evidence should be
    admitted, the jury must be carefully and clearly instructed as to how they can
    use the evidence in considering the case of the accused who adduces it, but not
    in considering the case of the co-accused:  see <i>Suzack</i> at paras. 127-28.
    The jury must be told in no uncertain terms that the propensity evidence may be
    used to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused who leads the
    evidence, but cannot be used in any way to support the Crown’s case against the
    co-accused.  Furthermore, Sharpe J.A., in <i>R. v. Diu</i> (2000), <span class=ssl2>49
    O.R. (3d) 40,</span> makes it clear that the trial judge has an additional
    obligation to instruct the jury not only as to the use they <i>cannot</i> make of propensity evidence but
    also the use that they <i>can</i> make of
    it.  He refers to these as positive and
    negative instructions.  A failure to give
    either prejudices the accused against whom the evidence was led:  see <i>Diu</i> at paras. 140-42.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As previously indicated, the Crown made it clear in his
    submissions that he was no longer taking the position that Kirk was a principal
    in the murder of Sullivan, but rather a party to the offence committed by
    Earhart.  The trial judge, however, gave
    the jury internally contradictory instructions on this issue: he instructed
    them that they had to decide which of the two accused killed Sullivan, yet also
    instructed them that there was no evidence that Kirk killed Sullivan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the charge in this respect was confusing,
    examining the impact of the confusion involves an inquiry into the avenues of
    liability that were open to the jury in relation to finding Kirk guilty of
    murder.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Pickton</i>, 2010 SCC 32, at para. 27, the Supreme
    Court makes it clear that it is a trial judge’s responsibility to charge the
    jury on all avenues of liability that arise on the evidence, regardless of the
    positions of counsel.&nbsp; The jury was therefore entitled to find Kirk guilty
    as a principal if there was sufficient evidence upon which they could
    reasonably arrive at that conclusion.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of course, a person may be found guilty of murder
    either as a party or as the principal; the offence is the same either
    way.&nbsp; What adds complexity in this case is that the probative value of the
    impugned evidence depends on whether or not both of these avenues of liability
    were properly before the jury in relation to Kirk.&nbsp; If Kirk’s only
    potential liability was as a party, then the question of who actually killed
    Sullivan was not a live one.&nbsp; This in turn would affect the probative
    value of the impugned evidence, as it would no longer be admissible to raise a
    reasonable doubt, as between Kirk and Earhart, that Kirk was the principal.&nbsp;
    Its probative value would have to derive from other issues to which it was
    relevant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The totality of the evidence of Kirk’s participation in
    the events of the night, other than his own testimony, can be summarized as
    follows:  Kirk participated in Sullivan’s
    abuse prior to the murder; Kirk was present when Sullivan was killed; as in the
    case of Earhart, when Kirk returned to B.K.’s house, he was covered in blood;
    and, Kirk helped Earhart clean up and dispose of evidence after the killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only evidence about what happened at the scene of
    the murder itself, and therefore who actually killed Sullivan, was Kirk’s
    testimony that it was Earhart who killed Sullivan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This evidence clearly establishes a basis upon which
    the jury could conclude that Kirk was a party to the offence.&nbsp; Taken at
    its highest, it shows that Kirk was complicit in the abduction, abuse and
    confinement of Sullivan, and that he aided and abetted Earhart in his fatal
    attack on Sullivan.&nbsp; However, the evidence simply cannot form a basis upon
    which a jury could conclude that Kirk was a principal.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Pickton</i>, at paras. 62-75, the Supreme Court
    considered the different levels of participation in an offence that give rise
    to liability as a principal versus liability as a party.&nbsp; In his concurring
    reasons, which were not disagreed with by the majority on this point, Lebel J.
    noted, at para. 73, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the ultimate legal liability is the same
    for a principal or for an aider or abettor, the findings of fact necessary and
    the specific legal principles which apply to each are different.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically, in relation to murder or manslaughter, in
    order to be liable as a principal one must be a legal cause of the death of the
    victim, that is, a significant contributing cause.&nbsp; In relation to first
    degree murder, this requirement is only made out when the accused is an
    “essential, substantial and integral part of the killing”:&nbsp; see <i>Pickton</i> at para. 64.&nbsp; Either way, this goes beyond acting in concert to lure and
    kill the victim—it requires participation in the actual killing:&nbsp; see <i>Pollock</i> at para. 75.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as noted above, there was ample evidence
    on which the jury could have found that Kirk actively participated in the
    confinement and abuse of Sullivan leading up to the murder.&nbsp; But there was
    simply no evidence upon which a jury could have concluded that Kirk
    participated in the actual killing.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, therefore, the trial judge was correct in
    instructing the jury that there was no evidence that Kirk killed Sullivan and
    that the only way in which they could find him criminally responsible for
    Sullivan’s death was as a party to the offence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that the trial judge ought not to have left
    the jury with the possibility that they could find Kirk guilty of murder as a
    principal.  However, while that error may
    well have caused confusion in the minds of the jury, I am persuaded, based on
    the evidence, the Crown’s argument and the trial judge’s charge taken as a
    whole, that the jury went into their deliberations with the understanding that Kirk
    could be found guilty of Sullivan’s murder, if at all, only as a party to the
    offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because Kirk’s liability as a principal was not or
    should not have been before the jury, the impugned evidence was no longer
    relevant to show that, as between Kirk and Earhart, Kirk was less likely to
    have been the actual killer due to Earhart’s propensity for violence.  However, I disagree with counsel for Earhart
    that this conclusion renders the bad character evidence, including the impugned
    evidence, nothing more than impermissible evidence of disposition. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only consequence of the fact that it was no longer
    open to the jury to find Kirk guilty of murder as the principal was that it
    eliminated one basis upon which he could be found guilty of the offence.  It remained open to the jury to find Kirk
    guilty of murder as a party to the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impugned evidence remained probative of Kirk’s
    defence that he took no active role in helping Earhart kill Sullivan. This is
    because, if the jury believed all or part of this evidence, they could conclude
    that Earhart had killed before and therefore was more than capable of doing so
    again - without assistance.  Of course,
    the issue in party liability is not whether the principal needed or wanted
    assistance or encouragement.  The inquiry
    is simply concerned with whether or not the alleged party to the offence
    actually did render assistance.  Nevertheless, as a matter of common sense if there is no evidence that
    the conduct that underlay the charge, here a brutal killing, was common to the
    accused, it is open to the jury to reason that it was less likely that he or
    she committed the offence unassisted.  It
    follows that in the circumstances here, if there is evidence that Earhart has
    previously committed the same or similar crimes, the jury may take that into
    consideration in their determination of whether they believe Kirk’s testimony
    that he played no part in assisting Earhart in the killing.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid;'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bad character evidence was also important to Kirk
    for the purpose of supporting T.D.’s credibility. T.D.’s evidence was
    significant to Kirk because it supported his testimony that Earhart was the
    aggressor and that his threats and abuse were directed at both Sullivan and
    Kirk.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For a number of reasons T.D.’s credibility was very
    much in issue.  Most significantly, T.D.
    told the police different stories about Earhart’s activities on the night in
    question.  At trial, T.D. sought to
    explain having initially lied to the police by saying that she was afraid of
    Earhart.  Her evidence that he told her
    he had killed before was therefore relevant to this issue – her fear of
    Earhart.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jurevicius’s statement also had at least some probative
    value in relation to T.D.’s credibility, as the fact that Earhart told
    Jurevicius he had killed before made it more likely that he said the same thing
    to T.D.  In addition, Jurevicius’s
    testimony spoke to Earhart’s violent character more generally and hence made it
    more likely that he had actually done the various things T.D. claimed had made
    her afraid of him.  While Jurevicius’s
    evidence did not have significant probative value in this regard, it was
    nonetheless relevant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Kirk’s Defence of Duress</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk’s evidence was that, throughout the evening, he
    acted out of fear of Earhart.  Kirk, on a
    number of occasions in his testimony expressed his fear.  I refer to passages such as “I was scared for
    my family, I was scared for [T.D.], I was scared for [Sullivan] ... when
    somebody pulls a gun on you, you just do what you’re supposed to do.”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impugned evidence was relevant to Kirk’s defence of
    duress in two ways.  The jury could use
    evidence of Earhart’s violent disposition in assessing whether they believed
    Kirk that he acted in a threatening manner toward him.  The evidence could also be used by the jury
    in their assessment of whether Kirk was ever in a position where he could
    safely escape.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While, in my view, the probative value of the impugned
    evidence in relation to Kirk’s defence of duress is not high, its relevance to
    this issue merits consideration along with the testimony’s relevance to the
    other issues outlined above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>d.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i><i>Summary  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore conclude that the impugned evidence
    remained relevant to Kirk’s ability to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether
    he actively assisted Earhart in his killing of Sullivan.   Putting it another way, the change in Kirk’s
    potential liability from that of a principal to that of a party, modified but
    did not eliminate the concept of the so-called cut-throat defence.  The jury was entitled to take the impugned
    evidence into account in assessing whether Earhart was the type of person who would
    have killed Sullivan on his own.  It
    therefore supported Kirk’s assertion that he did not actively participate in
    the murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the change in the route to Kirk’s
    potential culpability in Sullivan’s murder did not alter the circumstantial
    relevance of the impugned evidence to Kirk’s defence of duress or to T.D.’s
    credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Prejudicial Effect</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have already discussed the highly prejudicial nature
    of the impugned evidence. Significantly, for the purposes of this analysis,
    courts have expressed particular concern over bad character evidence that
    establishes past criminal conduct, especially when that conduct is similar to
    the charge at issue.  As LaForest J.
    noted in <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1
    S.C.R. 670 at p. 741: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Clearly, too, the more
    similar the offence to which the previous conviction relates to the conduct for
    which the accused is on trial, the greater the prejudice harboured by its
    admission. ... I think that a court should be very chary of admitting evidence
    of a previous conviction for a similar crime...  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Although writing in dissent, the
    factors enumerated by LaForest J. were specifically endorsed by the majority at
    pp. 697-98:  see also <i>R. v. Wilson</i> (2006), 210 C.C.C. (3d) 23
    at paras. 33-35.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart was on trial for first degree murder, and the
    jury heard testimony that he claimed to have killed before.  It is hard to imagine evidence more likely to
    give rise to the danger of moral prejudice that is the hallmark of character
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(iii) Balancing Probative Value and
    Prejudicial Effect</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As outlined above, the impugned evidence was probative
    of three separate issues relevant to Kirk’s defence.  Its prejudicial effect, as I have said, was high.
    Nevertheless, in my opinion the probative value of the impugned evidence was
    not clearly outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  I do not reach this conclusion easily, but I
    am mindful of the importance of T.D.’s testimony, and hence her credibility, to
    Kirk’s defence, and of the importance to Kirk of establishing that Earhart
    acted alone. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><b>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Adequacy of
    the Instructions to the Jury</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have concluded that, despite the change in the case
    against Kirk, the impugned evidence was properly before the jury.  The question then becomes whether the trial
    judge’s instructions adequately equipped them to use it in a manner that did
    not interfere with Earhart’s right to a fair trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I consider the trial judge’s failure to give the
    jury appropriate guidance concerning the meaning of the impugned evidence.  As previously discussed, the jury was not
    instructed as to the manner in which they should approach the testimony of T.D.
    and Jurevicius.  In the light of the
    potentially dangerous nature of this evidence, I am of the view that it was
    incumbent on the trial judge to provide the jury with careful instructions in
    order to ensure that they did not automatically leap to the conclusion that
    Earhart was a seasoned killer.  This did
    not happen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not suggesting that a trial judge must engage in
    an instruction of this nature for every piece of evidence adduced—this would be
    an insurmountable and, ultimately unhelpful task.  But in my view, having regard to the grave
    prejudice to Earhart of the impugned evidence, if misused, the trial judge was
    required to single it out for individualized treatment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, early in his charge, the trial judge instructed
    the jury with respect to out-of-court statements. However, he limited that
    portion of his charge to the testimony of various witnesses about what Sullivan
    had said.  I therefore conclude that he
    erred in failing to adequately instruct the jury with respect to the meaning
    they could assign to the impugned evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, I consider the trial judge’s instructions
    relating to the uses the jury could make of the impugned evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted by Sharpe J.A. in <i>Diu</i>, a cut-throat defence creates a challenging situation when it
    comes to the use that can be made of propensity evidence.  The court has an obligation to balance the
    fair trial rights of the accused whose character has been attacked with the
    co-accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  This obligation requires careful instructions
    as to the uses that can and cannot be made of such evidence, that is, careful
    positive and negative instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the charge was deficient in this
    respect.  Specifically, it did not
    contain give clear instructions about the permissible and impermissible ways in
    which the evidence could be used in Kirk’s defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of the instructions concerning the prohibited
    use of the impugned evidence, on several occasions the trial judge clearly and
    accurately instructed the jury that they must not use the propensity evidence
    to determine whether the Crown had proven its case against Earhart.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, there were two problems with the negative
    aspect of the charge concerning the propensity evidence.  First, I refer to the following passage that
    the jury may have taken to mean that they could use the fact that Earhart
    confessed to previous murders to decide the case against him. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Anything you find Mr. Earhart said to a witness
    about himself – what he did or said or saw, may be used to decide his case but
    only his case.  What he said is not
    evidence which may be considered in deciding Mr. Kirk’s case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in the passage noted in para. 56, above, the
    trial judge instructed the jury that evidence concerning Earhart’s propensity
    for violence “may be used to decide as between the two men, who is more likely
    to have attacked Ronald Sullivan.”  This
    is incorrect.  As the trial judge had
    himself repeatedly said, it could only be used to raise a reasonable doubt as
    to Kirk’s guilt, not to infer that Earhart was more likely the attacker.  It is a subtle distinction, but all the more
    important for that reason.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These two passages cause me considerable concern, but
    the main problem was the failure to tell the jury what use they <i>could</i> make of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the positive aspect of the trial judge’s
    charge concerning the propensity evidence, I return to the three issues for
    which this evidence was relevant - T.D.’s credibility, Kirk’s claim that
    Earhart killed Sullivan and that he acted alone and Kirk’s defence of
    duress.  It was incumbent upon the trial
    judge to explain to the jury how the impugned evidence was relevant to each of
    these three issues.  He failed to do
    so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to T.D.’s credibility, while the trial
    judge did not specifically make reference to the impugned evidence, he did
    remind the jury that T.D. had testified that she was frightened of
    Earhart.  In my view, it would not escape
    the jury that one source of T.D.’s fear would have been that he had told her of
    his previous killings.  His instructions
    in this regard were adequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to Kirk’s claim that he did not aid
    Earhart, the trial judge all but failed to give any direction at all on how the
    impugned evidence supported this position.  The sole reference to be found is the following:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So you may take such evidence into account in
    deciding whether Mr. Kirk committed the offence, because Mr. Earhart’s
    propensity to commit the offence charged may raise a reasonable doubt that Mr.
    Kirk committed the offence <u>or convince you that he was not involved</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This instruction flags for the jury that the impugned
    evidence is relevant to Kirk’s liability as a party, but leaves them in the
    dark as to how.  The chain of inferences
    leading from the impugned evidence to Kirk’s involvement as a party was
    reviewed above and I will not repeat it here.  What is important is that the jury received no assistance with the task
    of connecting the evidence to the available inferences.  It was up to the trial judge to carefully and
    clearly guide them through this complex process. Such assistance would not only
    have shown the jury how to use the evidence properly but also have made it less
    likely they would use it improperly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to Kirk’s defence of duress, the trial
    judge makes a similar error.  Again, his
    sole instruction on how the impugned evidence could be used was inadequate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You may as well take into account, <u>Mr. Kirk’s
    understanding of Mr. Earhart’s disposition to violence</u> in considering Mr.
    Kirk’s state of mind and how he would react to Mr. Earhart, whether he would
    believe that any threat might be carried out.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with this instruction is that the impugned
    evidence was not known to Kirk and therefore did not form part of his
    understanding of Earhart’s disposition to violence.  As well, the jury was left without any direction
    at all concerning whether or how the evidence could be used in relation to
    Kirk’s defence of duress.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Sharpe J.A. explained in <i>Diu</i>, the failure to give a positive instruction concerning
    character evidence not only prejudices the accused who led the evidence, but
    also the co-accused against whom it was led.  At para, 141 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    failure to provide the jury with guidance as to the appropriate use of the
    evidence left the jury in a vacuum.  The
    evidence had been admitted and the jury should have been clearly told what use
    it could make of it.  The positive part
    of the instruction was relevant to the situation of [the co-accused] as it
    would help to ensure that the jury would not use the evidence in an impermissible
    way.  [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with this reasoning and conclude that the trial
    judge erred in failing to give the jury guidance as to the appropriate use of
    the character evidence. This alone would constitute a significant error
    warranting a new trial and it is only exacerbated by the problems I have
    identified with the negative part of the bad character instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question is then whether this is an appropriate
    case in which to apply the curative proviso.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3) The Proviso</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that given the strength of the case
    for the prosecution, it is appropriate to apply the proviso.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Van, </i>[2009]
    1 S.C.R. 716, at paras. 34-36, the Supreme Court recently reviewed the
    jurisprudence regarding the application of the curative proviso under s.
    686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  LeBel J., writing for the majority, found
    that the jurisprudence established two categories of error that could be cured
    by application of the proviso.  The first
    is “an error so harmless or minor that it could not have had any impact on the
    verdict.”  The second category contains
    “serious errors that would otherwise justify a new trial or an acquittal, but
    for the fact that the evidence against the accused was so overwhelming that any
    other verdict would have been impossible to obtain.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have already noted, the inadequacies in the charge
    to the jury cannot be called “harmless” or “minor” errors.  Thus, the question in this case must be
    whether the evidence against Earhart is so overwhelming that there is no realistic
    possibility that a new trial would produce a different verdict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>LeBel J. described errors falling into the second
    category as follows, in para. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An appellate court can also uphold a conviction
    under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) in the event of an error that was <i>not</i> minor and that <i>cannot</i> be said to have caused no prejudice to the accused, if the case against the
    accused was so overwhelming that a reasonable and properly instructed jury
    would inevitably have convicted. ... The high standard of an invariable or
    inevitable conviction is understandable, given the difficult task for an
    appellate court of evaluating the strength of the Crown's case retroactively,
    without the benefit of hearing the witnesses' testimony and experiencing the
    trial as it unfolded. It is thus necessary to afford any possible measure of
    doubt concerning the strength of the Crown's case to the benefit of the accused
    person. The rationale for upholding a conviction in these circumstances is
    persuasive; in the words of Binnie J. in <i>R.
    v. Jolivet</i>, at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Where the evidence against an accused is
    powerful and there is no realistic possibility that a new trial would produce a
    different verdict, it is manifestly in the public interest to avoid the cost
    and delay of further proceedings. Parliament has so provided.</p>

lang=EN-US>Earhart was with Sullivan on the
    night in question, demonstrated animus toward him and abused him throughout the
    entire night. This evidence, together with the lack of any evidence Earhart was
    under duress leads inexorably to the conclusion that Earhart was necessarily
    either a principal or a party to Sullivan’s murder.   </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I. OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my
    colleague, Epstein J.A. Although I agree with my colleague’s conclusion that
    this appeal should be dismissed, I reach that conclusion for somewhat different
    reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ronald Kirk and the appellant, Donald Earhart, were
    jointly charged with the first degree murder of Ronald Sullivan. Following a
    trial by judge and jury, Kirk was acquitted and Earhart was convicted of first
    degree murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kirk was permitted to lead bad character evidence at
    trial concerning Earhart’s disposition for violence. The main issues on appeal
    concern whether the trial judge erred in admitting the bad character evidence
    and whether he erred in his instructions to the jury with respect to the use
    they could make of the bad character evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague has concluded that the bad character
    evidence was admissible in relation to only some of the issues about which the
    trial judge instructed the jury and that the trial judge made certain errors in
    his jury instructions. However, she would apply the proviso and dismiss the
    appeal because the evidence that Earhart participated in the first degree
    murder of Sullivan was overwhelming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the bad character evidence was admissible
    in relation to all of the issues about which the trial judge instructed the
    jury. Further, in my view, if the trial judge made any error in this case, it
    was in instructing the jury in a manner that was beneficial to Kirk. I am
    sceptical that any such error affected Earhart. In any event, if it did, I
    agree with my colleague’s conclusion that the evidence that Earhart
    participated in the murder of Sullivan was overwhelming and that a reasonable
    and properly instructed jury would inevitably have convicted Earhart of first
    degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II. FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the relevant facts are fully set out in my
    colleague’s reasons, it is unnecessary that I repeat them here. For the
    purposes of these reasons, it will be sufficient to recall the following
    aspects of the evidence that was before the jury:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sullivan was last seen alive on October 15,
    2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown adduced evidence at trial indicating
    that, during the early morning hours of October 15, 2004, Earhart, his cousin
    Kirk, and Earhart's girlfriend, T.D., drove around with Sullivan and that, as
    they did so, Earhart assaulted Sullivan repeatedly. Although Kirk participated
    in confining Sullivan to some extent, T.D.’s evidence was that Earhart was the
    primary aggressor and that Earhart was angry at Kirk as well as Sullivan. The
    group ended up at the home of a family member of Kirk, where Earhart again
    assaulted Sullivan repeatedly. Earhart and Kirk left the home with Sullivan in
    their car and returned about half an hour later without him. When they
    returned, both Earhart and Kirk had blood on their hands and on their clothing.
    After they returned, Earhart told T.D. that this was his messiest kill yet.
    Kirk made a gesture towards his neck and a gurgling sound, which T.D. took as
    meaning that Earhart stabbed Sullivan in the neck. Sullivan's body was found on
    April 26, 2005, in a wooded lot about a five-minute drive from the family
    member’s house. Although the medical evidence was not entirely conclusive, it
    appeared that Sullivan had been stabbed in the throat and torso a number of
    times. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kirk was permitted to introduce bad character
    evidence at trial concerning Earhart’s propensity for violence. Such evidence
    included the testimony of T.D. and another woman, Krista Jurevicius, to the
    effect that Earhart told each of them that he had killed before.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kirk testified at trial, while Earhart did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kirk gave the only eyewitness evidence
    concerning the murder. He testified to the effect that it was Earhart who
    killed Sullivan by stabbing him in the neck and chest or stomach area, that he
    did not know Earhart was planning to kill Sullivan, that he was afraid of
    Earhart, that he did not assist Earhart in killing Sullivan, and that anything
    he did do to assist Earhart was because of his fear of Earhart. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>III. ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Was the Bad
    Character Evidence Admissible?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As my colleague has explained, the question of the
    admissibility of bad character evidence in relation to Earhart arose following
    T.D.’s examination-in-chief. Kirk’s counsel sought permission to elicit bad
    character evidence and advanced three bases for its admission:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>given the potential inference that one or both
    of Earhart and Kirk must have killed Sullivan, to raise a reasonable doubt
    concerning whether Kirk was the person who killed Sullivan;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>if the jury was satisfied that Kirk participated
    in killing Sullivan, to raise a reasonable doubt concerning whether Kirk was
    acting under duress;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>to support T.D.’s credibility by demonstrating
    that inconsistencies in her statements to the police were due to her fear of
    Earhart.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart’s trial counsel did not object to the proposed
    evidence to the extent that it related to specific events tending to show
    Earhart’s propensity for violence or his bad character. She was, however,
    concerned that more general evidence of bad character, rooted in rumours in the
    community about Earhart’s reputation, should not be admitted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was familiar with this court’s decision
    in <i>R. v. Pollock</i> (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d)
    213, and its authoritative guidance on the admissibility of bad character
    evidence tendered by an accused against a co-accused. He agreed with counsel
    that bad character evidence relating to specific events was admissible for the
    purposes identified and that open-ended questions regarding rumours in the
    community about Earhart's general reputation should not be permitted.  Apart from a couple of isolated instances in
    which the trial judge excluded reputation evidence and hearsay, all of the bad
    character evidence was admitted without further argument or discussion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the pre-charge conference, the trial Crown advised
    that it was his position that there was one principal offender, given that
    there was no evidence that the two accused acted together to kill Sullivan. He
    also indicated that he was not taking the position that Kirk was guilty as the
    person who actually killed Sullivan.  Rather, it was the Crown’s position that Kirk aided Earhart in killing
    Sullivan, and that his liability for first degree murder was as a party rather
    than as a perpetrator. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Earhart argues for the first time that once
    the trial Crown took the position that Kirk was not liable for first degree
    murder as the perpetrator, but only as a party, the bad character evidence was
    no longer admissible and the trial judge should have instructed the jury that
    such evidence was not available for their consideration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like my colleague, I would reject this submission.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> However, I do not agree with her conclusion that the trial judge erred in
    instructing the jury that Kirk was potentially liable as a principal and that
    the bad character evidence was available for consideration in relation to that
    issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an accused seeks to introduce bad character
    evidence against a co-accused, the test for admissibility is whether the
    prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially outweighs its probative value:<i> Pollock</i>, at para. 110. Although in this
    case, aspects of the bad character evidence had significant potential
    prejudicial effect, the bad character evidence retained high potential
    probative value for Kirk’s defence despite the Crown’s change in position. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming for the moment that the only route to a guilty
    verdict against Kirk was as a party, Kirk was entitled to rely on the bad
    character evidence to support his defence that Earhart was the killer and that
    he acted alone. The bad character evidence also remained relevant to raise a
    reasonable doubt concerning whether Kirk participated in the offence under
    duress and to support T.D.’s credibility. The bad character evidence had
    significant potential probative value for all of these purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of the position that Kirk aided Earhart in
    killing Sullivan, the Crown relied on evidence indicating that: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kirk participated in confining Sullivan over the
    course of the evening;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>while at the family member’s home, Kirk made a
    comment to the effect that people would be after him and Earhart if they did
    not rough up Sullivan;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>before driving off with Earhart and Sullivan,
    Kirk said he and Earhart had “to do this” or there would be consequences for
    them and their families; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kirk was present at the scene of Sullivan’s
    murder; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>on Kirk’s own admission, just before Earhart
    stabbed Sullivan, Kirk was standing behind the car, about 20 feet away from
    Earhart and Sullivan, and he was holding a gun. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>As I have said, there was also
    evidence before the jury that Kirk had blood on his hands and on his clothing
    when he returned to his family member’s home from the murder scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the face of this evidence, the bad character
    evidence concerning Earhart’s disposition for violence was essential to Kirk's
    ability to make full answer and defence because it supported the credibility of
    his assertions that Earhart acted alone in killing Sullivan and that, to the
    extent that Kirk participated in the events, he did so under duress.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bad character evidence was also important to Kirk
    for the purpose of supporting T.D.’s credibility. T.D.’s evidence was
    significant to Kirk because it supported his testimony that it was Earhart who
    was the aggressor over the course of the evening and that Earhart's threatening
    actions were directed at both Sullivan and Kirk. The bad character evidence concerning
    Earhart’s conduct towards T.D. and her son provided an explanation concerning
    T.D.’s inconsistent statements to the police.  In addition, Jurevicius’s evidence supported the likelihood that Earhart
    told T.D. that he had killed before.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in my opinion, even though the trial Crown was
    no longer taking the position that Kirk was a principal in Sullivan’s murder,
    liability as a perpetrator remained a viable route to first degree murder
    vis-à-vis Kirk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the jury rejected Kirk’s evidence concerning what
    happened at the murder scene but accepted, at least in general terms, the
    evidence favouring the Crown concerning the events leading up to Kirk and
    Earhart’s departure with Sullivan from the family member’s home, an inference
    remained that either Earhart or Kirk killed Sullivan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, if the jury rejected the evidence of the Crown
    witnesses and Kirk concerning Earhart’s involvement in Sullivan’s death but
    accepted Kirk’s admission that he was at the scene and knew how Sullivan was
    killed, it would have been open to the jury to draw an inference that Kirk was
    the killer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the fact that the Crown was not advancing the
    position that Kirk was a perpetrator did not render that route to Kirk’s
    liability unavailable: see <i>R. v. Pickton</i>,
    2010 SCC 32, at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, despite the Crown’s change in its theory
    of Kirk’s liability, in my view, the bad character evidence remained relevant
    to the issue of whether there was a reasonable doubt that Kirk acted as a
    perpetrator in killing Sullivan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, although for somewhat different reasons,
    I agree with my colleague’s conclusion that the bad character evidence was
    properly admitted and I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>2) Did the Trial Judge Err in his
    Instructions to the Jury concerning the Bad Character Evidence?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart submits that there was no live issue at the
    trial concerning whether, as between Earhart and Kirk, Kirk was the likely
    killer. Accordingly, the trial judge’s instruction concerning the use the jury
    could make of the bad character evidence to address that issue would have been
    confusing. Moreover, the trial judge’s specific instruction that the jury could
    use the bad character evidence to determine who, as between the two men, was
    the likely attacker was wrong in law and could have led the jury into misusing
    the bad character evidence to find Earhart guilty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, Earhart contends that the trial judge
    erred in his instructions to the jury concerning the use of the bad character
    evidence in relation to duress. Finally, he submits that the trial judge erred
    in failing to give adequate instructions concerning the use that could be made
    of the bad character evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>i) Whether the Trial Judge Erred in His <i>Suzack</i> Instruction</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Near the end of the general part of his charge to the
    jury, and before turning to the definition of murder, the trial judge gave a <i>Suzack</i> instruction:  see <i>R.
    v. Suzack</i> (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.), application for leave to
    appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 583. This
    instruction explained to the jury one of the reasons why the evidence
    concerning Earhart’s propensity for violence was admitted – to enable Kirk to
    raise a reasonable doubt about whether he participated in the murder.  The instruction also explained to the jury
    that while such evidence could be used for that purpose, it could not be used
    to support an inference that Earhart was the killer.  In the words of the trial judge: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At times, someone charged with a crime will say, it
    was not me, it was the other person charged who committed the crime. And, he or
    she may point to evidence which may point to the other person as the sort of
    person to commit the offence charged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, you have heard evidence with respect
    to Mr. Earhart’s disposition or propensity for violence so I want to instruct
    you specifically on how you can use this evidence in considering the case of
    Mr. Kirk and how you must not use the evidence in considering the case of Mr.
    Earhart.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Firstly, the use to which Mr. Kirk may make of such
    evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Such evidence may assist you in deciding whether
    the Crown has proven its case against Mr. Kirk. So you may take such evidence
    into account in deciding whether Mr. Kirk committed the offence, because Mr.
    Earhart's propensity to commit the offence charged may raise a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Kirk committed the offence or convince you that he was not involved.
    So it is really nothing more than a piece of circumstantial evidence which may
    form the basis of a finding that he did not commit the offence charged or that
    there is a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kirk committed the crime charged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Secondly, the use to which such evidence must not
    be put in considering the case of Mr. Earhart:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You must not use such evidence to decide that Mr.
    Earhart committed the offence of murder because he is the sort of person who
    would likely do so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is a fundamental rule of our criminal justice system
    that criminal responsibility depends on the Crown's ability to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the accused committed the act of murder set out in the
    indictment. Mr. Earhart is not on trial for past misconduct or misconduct which
    followed the alleged event. He is being tried only for the events of October 14th
    and 15th.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So, to summarize, you may use, the evidence of Mr.
    Earhart’s propensity for violence to help you decide that in fact, Mr. Kirk did
    not commit the offence or there must be in your minds, is the position of Mr.
    Kirk, reasonable doubt that Mr. Kirk committed the offence of murder or helped
    in its commission. You must not use this evidence, however, as I said to help
    you decide that Mr. Earhart committed the offence charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After summarizing some of the bad character evidence,
    the trial judge then turned to the definition of murder. As part of those
    instructions, the trial judge provided the jury with two decision trees, one
    for the route to liability as a perpetrator and, if the jury decided that one
    of the two accused was the perpetrator, a second decision tree for a party to
    the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the perpetrator decision tree, the trial
    judge instructed the jury that the first question was: “did Mr. Earhart or Mr.
    Kirk, by an unlawful act, cause the death of Ronald Sullivan?” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After explaining what is meant by an unlawful act, the
    trial judge turned to the issue of identity. First he summarized the positions
    of the parties as follows: the Crown and Kirk both took the position that Earhart
    was the attacker; Earhart’s position was that the Crown witnesses were liars or
    unreliable and that the Crown had not proved its case against him beyond a
    reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge next reviewed the evidence relevant to
    the question of identity. As part of that review, he referred to the evidence
    of Earhart’s disposition for violence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is evidence in this case of Donald Earhart's
    disposition to violence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is an absence of such evidence in Mr. Kirk. <u>As
    I have instructed you over the use of such evidence it may be used to decide as
    between the two men, who is more likely to have attacked Ronald Sullivan</u>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then explained the questions posed on
    the perpetrator decision tree. After dealing with the remaining issues, he gave
    the jury a <i>W.D.</i> instruction
    concerning Kirk’s liability as perpetrator:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>If you accept Mr.
    Kirk's evidence — if you accept his evidence — Mr. Kirk's evidence that he did
    not kill Mr. Sullivan or on the bases of his denial and the other evidence that
    you have heard in this case, you are left with a reasonable doubt that he was
    the perpetrator, or the killer, then you must find that Ronald Kirk’s only
    involvement, if there is any, may be as a party to the offence of murder and
    not as a perpetrator or principal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, the trial judge turned to the party decision
    tree. At the beginning of those instructions, he said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Now, the focus of my
    charge here will be on Mr. Kirk. I do that for a couple of reasons. One, it is
    not the position of the Crown that Mr. Kirk was the killer. The Crown agrees
    that if Mr. Kirk is involved, he is involved as a party to the offence as an
    “aider”. ... Two, I think it is fair to say in this case that all the evidence
    points away from Mr. Kirk as the killer or the principal. If Mr. Kirk is guilty
    of any criminal offence in this case, it may only be, on the basis of the
    evidence that we have heard, as a party to the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the question of aiding, the trial judge told the
    jury that “the only evidence with respect to any act of assistance by Mr. Kirk
    is his evidence of what happened [at the woodlot]”. Further, he said, “from my
    memory, there was no evidence that Mr. Kirk displayed that gun – showed it to
    anybody – showed it to, for example, Sullivan, once out of the car.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later, when dealing with a question of whether Kirk
    aided Earhart in Sullivan’s murder in the aggravating circumstances of a
    confinement, so as to be guilty of first degree murder, the trial judge said he
    could think of no evidence that “Mr. Kirk by a physical act became an
    essential, substantial or integral part of the knife attack and so Mr.
    Sullivan’s death”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart contends that the <i>Suzack</i> instruction was confusing because it related to the issue of
    whether Kirk was the perpetrator; however, that was not a live issue at the
    trial. Neither the Crown nor Earhart took the position that Kirk was the
    perpetrator and the trial judge reminded the jury of that. Further, according
    to Earhart, the trial judge’s specific instruction that the bad character evidence
    could be used to determine who, as between the two men, was the likely attacker
    was wrong in law and may have caused the jury to misuse the bad character
    evidence to find Earhart guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that the jury would have found the
    trial judge’s instruction confusing for the reason advanced by Earhart. The
    trial judge explained at the outset of the <i>Suzack</i> instruction that the basis for admitting bad character evidence was that, on
    some occasions, a person charged with a crime will point at another person
    charged as having committed the crime and, in doing so, will rely on evidence
    that may demonstrate that the other person is the type of person to commit the
    offence. That was Kirk’s position here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as part of the <i>Suzack</i> instruction, the trial judge told the jury that “Mr.
    Earhart’s propensity to commit the offence charged may raise a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Kirk committed the offence or convince you that he was not involved.”
    The trial judge instructed the jury to consider Kirk’s potential liability as a
    perpetrator as well as his potential liability as a party. Having regard to the
    instructions to consider Kirk’s liability as both a perpetrator and a party, I
    fail to see how the jury would have been confused by the <i>Suzack</i> instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the trial judge’s specific instruction when
    reviewing the evidence relevant to the issue of identity that the bad character
    evidence “may be used to decide as between the two men, who is more likely to
    have attacked Ronald Sullivan”, it would have been obvious to the jury that
    that instruction was a short way of referring the jury back to the trial
    judge’s earlier, more specific instruction concerning how the jury could, and
    could not, use the bad character evidence. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that
    this instruction constituted an error in law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> That said, it
    seems to me that considered as a whole, the trial judge’s instructions were favourable
    to Kirk because, on a practical basis, they left no evidentiary route to a
    finding of guilt against Kirk. Earhart’s main complaint is that the bad
    character evidence was legally irrelevant. As I read the charge, the trial
    judge’s instructions may have made the bad character evidence irrelevant from a
    practical standpoint, but, as I will explain, the instructions did not
    constitute an error of law in relation to Earhart.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge left Kirk’s potential
    liability as a perpetrator with the jury, he did not identify the evidentiary
    route that could give rise to Kirk’s guilt as a perpetrator if the jury
    rejected Kirk’s evidence. Nor did he review the evidence that could have
    supported such a finding. Perhaps more importantly, he expressed his opinion
    that the evidence pointed away from Kirk as the perpetrator and that the only
    route to Kirk’s guilt was as a party. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, concerning Kirk’s potential liability as a
    party, the trial judge did not summarize the evidence the Crown relied on as
    supporting Kirk’s liability as a party and effectively told the jury there was
    no evidence capable of supporting such a finding. Significantly, except when he
    gave the <i>Suzack</i> instruction set out
    at para. 26 above, the trial judge did not refer to the bad character evidence
    as being relevant to the question of whether Kirk performed some act that
    amounted to aiding Earhart. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am sceptical that the trial judge’s favourable
    instructions in relation to Kirk amount to legal error vis-à-vis Earhart. To
    some extent, the trial judge’s favourable instructions in relation to Kirk may
    have detracted from Earhart’s assertion that none of the Crown witnesses were
    credible or reliable. However, the trial judge was entitled to express his
    opinion on the evidence so long as he made it clear to the jury, which he did,
    that they were free to disregard his opinion. The trial judge’s instructions
    that the jury was obliged to acquit Earhart if they had a reasonable doubt
    about his participation in Sullivan’s death were crystal clear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the pre-charge conference, the trial judge explained
    that he thought it necessary to leave Kirk as perpetrator with the jury because
    Earhart’s position raised that issue. Earhart’s trial counsel confirmed that
    was an issue. Having decided to leave the issue with the jury, the trial judge
    effectively took it away.  If this
    constitutes legal error vis-à-vis Earhart, I would apply the proviso and
    dismiss the appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have explained, in my opinion, Kirk as perpetrator
    remained an available route to Kirk’s liability despite the Crown’s change of
    position. Had the jury been properly instructed on the available routes to
    Kirk’s liability, I agree with my colleague’s conclusion that the case against
    Earhart was overwhelming for the reasons she identified <span style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:200%'>and that the jury would have inevitably returned a
    verdict of first degree murder against him.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ii) Whether the Trial Judge Erred
    in his Instructions Concerning the Use of the Bad Character Evidence in
    Relation to Duress</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart submits that since Kirk did not have personal
    knowledge of all of the evidence relating to Earhart’s disposition for
    violence, the trial judge erred in leaving such evidence with the jury because
    it was not relevant to the issue of duress.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept this submission. The bad character
    evidence was relevant to Kirk’s defence of duress in two ways: first, matters
    Kirk was aware of were relevant to enable the jury to evaluate Kirk’s state of
    mind; and second, in the context of raising a reasonable doubt about Kirk’s
    liability, to demonstrate the likelihood that Earhart acted in the manner that
    Kirk described: see, for example, <i>R. v.
    Pilon</i> (2009), 243 C.C.C. (3d) 109 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 32–33. Although
    the trial judge did not give the jury specific instructions concerning this
    second use, in my view, that omission could only have inured to Earhart’s
    benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>iii) The Adequacy of the Trial
    Judge’s Instructions Concerning the Bad Character Evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earhart contends that the trial judge erred by failing
    to instruct the jury about how to approach the evidence of T.D. and Jurevicius
    concerning his statements that he had killed before. He complains that it was
    never made clear to the jury that the statements may have been nothing more
    than boasting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept this submission. It would have been
    obvious to the jury that they could interpret Earhart’s statements that he had
    killed before as merely boasts. In any event, to the extent that this
    particular interpretation was significant, it was a factual issue that could
    have been addressed by counsel through cross-examination or in the closing
    address. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I am not persuaded that Earhart was prejudiced
    in any way by the trial judge’s failure to give the jury more complete
    instructions concerning the use they could make of the bad character evidence
    in relation to the issues of T.D’s credibility and duress. The trial judge gave
    the jury a <i>Suzack</i> instruction, which
    made it clear that the jury could use the bad character evidence in assessing
    Kirk’s liability for the offence as a perpetrator or a party. The trial judge’s
    failure to give more complete instructions on other potential uses that the
    jury could make of the bad character evidence against Earhart could only have
    inured to Earhart’s benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>IV. DISPOSITION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the

    of her reasons, my colleague identifies the nine areas of bad character
    evidence to which Earhart objects. However, in conducting her analysis my
    colleague focuses on the evidence of T.D. and Jurevicius to the effect that
    Earhart told each of them he had killed before. I agree that this evidence
    should be the focus of the admissibility analysis because it carried the most
    significant potential for prejudice. As for the balance of the evidence to
    which Earhart objects, some of it was led by his own counsel and some of it did
    not amount to bad character evidence as against Earhart. Other aspects of the
    bad character evidence (for example, evidence that he beat T.D. repeatedly)
    were properly before the jury, as will be explained in these reasons, as being
    relevant to T.D.’s credibility or Kirk’s defence of duress. Other portions were
    admissible as part of the narrative concerning the events of October 14 and 15,
    2002 or as being relevant to the issue of whether Earhart had a knife. In
    essence, I have accepted the Crown’s arguments concerning the balance of the
    evidence to which Earhart objects.</span></p>
