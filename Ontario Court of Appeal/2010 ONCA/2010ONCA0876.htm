  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a multi-day trial, the trial judge granted the
    parties a divorce and made a variety of orders addressing issues of support and
    equalization of assets.  The appellant
    raises 14 issues on appeal.  In our view,
    to raise some of these issues is to attempt to have this court revisit the
    factual and credibility findings of the trial judge.  Of the various issues raised by the
    appellant, it is necessary to address only the following matters for the
    disposition of this appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Discussion</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Award
    of Lump Sum Spousal Support</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that this is not one of those
    unusual cases in which an award of lump sum spousal support is justified.  He maintains that the trial judge’s award of
    lump sum spousal support was not made to address the economic disadvantages
    arising from the marriage but, rather, as an impermissible means of
    redistributing the parties’ family assets under the guise of support.  He also contends that there is no evidence in
    this case suggesting possible difficulties in enforcing periodic spousal
    support payments, if ordered.  Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred by initiating, on his own
    motion, consideration of the merits of a lump sum spousal support award when
    the respondent did not originally seek this relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to these arguments.  We see no basis on which to interfere with
    the trial judge’s discretionary decision to award lump sum spousal
    support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the record before this court, the possibility of a
    lump sum award arose when it emerged, towards the end of the trial, that the
    appellant had lost his job and was unemployed.  The record also reveals that the appellant: (1) failed to fully honour
    two previous court orders for support; (2) obliged the respondent to obtain her
    court-ordered spousal support through the enforcement procedures of the Family
    Responsibility Office, notwithstanding that he had sufficient resources to make
    the payments at the relevant times; and (3) in respect of at least some of the
    spousal support payments that he did make, the appellant unilaterally reduced
    the quantum of his payments to levels he regarded as appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also note that the trial judge found that the
    appellant could be “relied upon to put his own financial interest” ahead of
    that of the respondent and the children of the marriage, that he had failed to
    make full and timely disclosure of his income and assets, and that: “He has in
    the past and would in the future resent paying [the respondent] spousal
    support” because of his estrangement from his children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the trial judge’s findings, and in light of the
    evidence above-described, there was a foundation for the challenged spousal
    support award.  Moreover, the trial judge
    gave detailed reasons for his decision to award lump sum spousal support and
    took account of the legal principles governing such awards.  We are unable to conclude that his reasons
    disclose any error in principle or a significant misapprehension of the
    evidence with respect to this issue.  Nor, in our opinion, is the challenged award clearly wrong.  Accordingly, there is no basis for appellate
    intervention on this issue: see for example, <i>Hickey v. Hickey</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, at paras. 10-11; <i>Marinangeli v. Marinangeli</i> (2003), 66
    O.R. (3d) 40 (C.A.), at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it was not inappropriate for the trial judge
    to invite submissions from the parties on the matter of a lump sum spousal
    support award once it was disclosed, towards the end of the proceeding, that
    the appellant was unemployed.  Although
    the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant remained capable of earning a
    substantial income, the appellant’s job loss created added uncertainty about
    his future compliance with any periodic spousal support award.  We note that the parties were given the
    opportunity to make full and complete submissions on this issue and availed
    themselves of that opportunity.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Award of “Retroactive” Spousal Support</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by
    awarding spousal support commencing August 1, 2007, since the respondent allegedly
    delayed in bringing a motion for support until July 2008.  The first court order for support was made in
    September 2008.  Therefore, the appellant
    contends, September 1, 2008 was the earliest date from which spousal support
    should have been ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  A
    support claimant is presumptively entitled to prospective support from the date
    of notice that a support claim is being pursued: see <i>MacKinnon v. MacKinnon</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 175 (C.A.), at para.
    22.  In this case, the respondent filed
    an answer in December 2006 in which she claimed spousal support.  From that point forward, the issue between
    the parties was prospective support from and including 2007.  On the trial judge’s findings, the appellant
    had the financial means to pay spousal support and spousal support was needed.  Further, given the respondent’s pleading, the
    appellant knew that spousal support was in issue and would be determined at
    trial.  Thus, there is no principled
    reason to relieve the appellant from his responsibility to pay appropriate
    spousal support: <i>MacKinnon</i>, at paras.
    24-25. <span class=GramE>Although</span> the appellant paid spousal support
    during the period in issue, he determined the amount.  In the circumstances, we see no error in the
    trial judge’s decision to determine the amount of spousal support that should
    have been paid, commencing August 1, 2007.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       2008 Child Support</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge used the appellant’s 2007 income to
    calculate the child support that the appellant should have paid in 2008. The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant’s 2007 income was $206,223.  This figure was comprised of the appellant’s 2007
    employment income of $111,302 plus $94,921, being one-half of the pre-tax <span
class=GramE>amount</span> of the phantom stock payment the appellant received
    in 2007. Based on a 2007 income of $206,223, the trial judge determined that
    the 2008 child support payable by the appellant was $2,644 per month.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by
    treating part of the phantom stock payment the appellant received in 2007 as
    part of the appellant’s 2007 income. The net amount of the phantom stock
    payment was included as an asset in the appellant’s net family property. The
    appellant argues that treating part of the phantom stock payment as income for
    the purpose of calculating child support amounted to impermissible “double
    dipping”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that the trial judge erred in calculating the
    child support the appellant should have paid in 2008, but we reach that
    conclusion for different reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, where the amount of child support that should
    have been paid in a prior year is under consideration, the payor’s actual
    income for that year is the amount that should be used to calculate support for
    the prior period, so long as the payor’s actual income for the prior period is
    known.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When calculating prospective child support, income from
    the previous year is used to calculate future support, essentially as a matter
    of convenience, because actual income for the upcoming year is incapable of
    exact determination. However, where, as here, the actual amount of income
    earned in a prior year is known, it is that amount that should determine the
    quantum of support that should have been paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our conclusion in this regard is rooted in common sense
    – but also in  s.2(3) of the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>, SOR/97-175,
    which states, “[w]here, for the purposes of these Guidelines, any amount is
    determined on the basis of specified information, the most current information
    must be used.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, we agree with the following comments of
    Baltman J. in<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Desjardins
    v. Bart</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>, 2006 CanLII 33701 (ON S.C.) at para. 17:</span></p>
  <p class=sub-paragraphentry1><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Although the normal practice, based on
    convenience, is to address child support going forward based on the previous
    year’s income, once the court is intervening and looking backwards at a
    particular period, it makes sense to adjust child support retroactively for the
    relevant period, which in this case is 2004.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s income for 2008 was known at the time
    of trial – it was $105, 212. Having regard to the principles we have
    enunciated, the child support payable by the appellant for 2008 should be
    adjusted to reflect the amount payable under the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i> based on an income of $105,212, less the
    amount actually paid by the appellant for that period.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Treatment
    of Time Share in St. Maarten</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by
    ordering the respondent to convey her interest in the parties’ St. Maarten time
    share to the appellant.  He argues that
    the parties should continue to jointly own the time share and that it should be
    sold with the proceeds equally divided between the parties.  On the facts of this case, we reject this
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant testified under
    cross-examination that he wished to keep the time share until he was forced to
    sell it or it became financially advisable to sell it.  The parties agreed that the net value of the
    time share was $7,475.29.  It also
    appears to have been undisputed that, following separation, the appellant
    assumed <i>de facto</i> control and
    exclusive use of the time share.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that context, the transfer of interest ordered by
    the trial judge is both understandable and consistent with the appellant’s own
    expressed objectives regarding the time share.  By acceding to the appellant’s position, the trial judge, in effect,
    directed that the appellant should enjoy sole ownership of the time share.  The facts established and the positions of
    the parties outlined at trial suggest an effective agreement between them on
    the treatment of the time share.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also note that, by virtue of the ordered transfer,
    the appellant will have the exclusive right to determine when, and if, the time
    share should be sold and to retain for his sole use all sale proceeds realized
    on its disposition. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(5)       Treatment
    of Joint Line of Credit</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ordered the respondent to pay the
    balance owed on the parties’ outstanding joint line of credit.  To facilitate this, he directed that part of
    the funds in the appellant’s registered retirement saving plans (“RRSPs”) be
    vested in the respondent, from which the respondent is to pay the line of
    credit.  The appellant argues that in so
    ordering, the trial judge erred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree.  The
    trial judge had no jurisdiction to make a vesting order for the purpose of
    satisfying an outstanding debt/account.  The respondent has been unable to point to any authority that, in our
    view, suggests to the contrary.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(6)       2008 Tax Refund</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In September 2007, the appellant invested $75,000 of
    the phantom stock payment in his RRSPs.  This investment, together with other RRSP investments by the appellant, resulted
    in payment of an income tax refund to the appellant in 2008 in the amount of
    $36,851.75.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ordered that the appellant include
    one-half of the pro-rated value of his income tax refund in his net family
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that this was an error.  We agree.  The appellant received the phantom stock payment in June 2007 and
    included the net amount in his net family property statement, calculated as of
    the valuation date of August 7, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The $75,000 investment was made after the valuation
    date.  It was an error to include any
    part of the refund attributable to the $75,000 investment in the appellant’s
    net family property.  If the appellant’s
    remaining RRSP investments were made prior to the valuation date, the parties
    may recalculate the inclusion, using the same formula as the trial judge used.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(7)       Alleged Reasonable Apprehension of Bias</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also contends that a reasonable
    apprehension of bias arose from interventions at trial by the trial judge,
    resulting in hearing unfairness and a denial of procedural justice.  We disagree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a hotly contested trial.  It appears that almost every conceivable
    property and support issue arising from the separation of the parties was
    disputed.  In this context, we are not
    satisfied that the impugned comments of the trial judge, or the number of his
    interventions at trial, rise to the high threshold necessary to establish a
    reasonable apprehension of bias.  This
    ground of appeal is also dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this appeal, the appellant seeks to retry numerous
    aspects of this case.  That is not the
    role of this court.  While we might have
    resolved certain of the contested issues at trial in a manner that differs from
    that of the trial judge, apart from our above-noted comments, we see no
    reversible error in his decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, in part, in
    accordance with these reasons.  The
    appellant has been successful on only three of the numerous issues raised on
    appeal, and those issues are relatively minor in nature.  As a result, the respondent is entitled to
    some of her costs of the appeal, which we fix in the total amount of $15,000,
    inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.  Of that amount, the sum of $10,000 shall be
    designated as attributable to spousal support owed by the appellant to the
    respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant seeks leave to appeal the trial
    judge’s award of costs to the respondent.  In light of the disposition of this appeal, we see no merit to the
    appellant’s challenge of that discretionary costs ruling.  In our view, the award is not tainted by any
    error in principle, nor is it plainly wrong.  We therefore decline to grant leave to appeal the costs award at trial.</p>
