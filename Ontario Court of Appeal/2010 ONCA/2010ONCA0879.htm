    Systems (the appellants) are located in the Netherlands.  They brought a motion to set aside service <i>ex juris </i>of the statement of claim in
    the present proceedings and to stay the action as against them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    Rogin dismissed the motion on the basis that both appellants have a “real and
    substantial” connection to Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I explain below, I see no basis for interfering with
    the motions judge’s decision.  I would,
    therefore, dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following facts are taken from the statement of
    claim in the main action and the affidavit of John Stubbs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The four defendants in this action are closely related.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ATS Applied Tech Systems Inc. (ATS Canada) is a
    Canadian company with its head office in Ontario.  ATS Applied Tech Systems LLC (ATS US) is
    incorporated in Delaware in the United States, but carries on business in
    Michigan.  Together, ATS Canada and ATS
    US are known as ATS Applied Tech Systems North America (ATS NA).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both ATS Canada and ATS US are wholly owned
    subsidiaries of ATS International BV (ATS International), a Dutch company with
    its head office in Haarlem, the Netherlands.  All ATS companies are in the business of supplying controls and IT
    systems and providing training services to increase efficiency in their
    customers’ operations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ATS International is the sole shareholder of both ATS Canada
    and ATS US.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Foundation Applied Tech Systems (Foundation) is also
    located in the Netherlands.  It was formed
    to hold approximately 15% of the shares of ATS International on behalf of
    employees of the ATS companies, pursuant to the Employee Share Purchase Plan
    (the Plan).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mike James and Hans Damman each own 42.5% of ATS
    International.  (As mentioned, the
    remaining 15% of the shares are held by Foundation, on behalf of ATS employees.)  Messrs. James and Dammen are the directors
    and officers of ATS International, its subsidiaries and Foundation.  Mr. James is the president of all three ATS
    companies.  He is also the chairman of
    the Board of Foundation.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005, John Stubbs and his wife, Deborah Kelly (the
    respondents), were living and working in England.  Mr. Stubbs was the head of manufacturing systems
    for Rolls-Royce Aerospace in the United Kingdom.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rolls-Royce Aerospace used ATS’s services.  Through that, Mr. Stubbs became acquainted
    with Mr. James.  In early 2005, the two
    men began discussing the possibility of launching a consulting/systems business
    in North America.  Mr. James represented
    that in 2004, ATS International had profits of 200,000 euros.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 17, 2005, based in part on that
    representation, Mr. Stubbs left his employment with Rolls-Royce Aerospace and
    began working for ATS.  Also in reliance on
    Mr. James’ representation and using the ATS formula for valuing shares, Mr.
    Stubbs invested 100,788 euros to purchase 5% (90,800 shares) of ATS
    International.  This investment was made
    through Foundation.  Purchase of the
    shares was part of Mr. Stubbs’ employment agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stubbs was first employed with ATS International on
    an expense-only consulting basis.  He remained
    resident in England.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> On August 1,
    2005, Mr. Stubbs started working for ATS International on a full-time with pay
    basis.  His role was to fix the failing
    business systems used by ATS globally and then to take the helm of ATS’s North
    American business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At around this time, Mr. Stubbs learned that contrary to
    Mr. James’ representations, ATS International suffered a loss in 2004 of 34,000
    euros.  His investment of 100,788 euros had
    been critical to ATS International’s ability to continue in business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In February of 2006, Mr. Stubbs took control of the ATS
    North American operations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late June of 2006, while Mr. Stubbs was still
    resident in England, ATS International substantially increased his duties: he became
    the Chief Executive Officer for ATS Canada and ATS US.  Mr. Stubbs was officially transferred to the
    ATS NA payroll at that time and took full operational responsibility for both
    ATS Canada and ATS US.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stubbs’ employment agreement took the form of various
    letters from Mr. James.  The most crucial
    of those letters is dated July 18, 2006.  It reads as follows:</p>
  <p>Dear John,</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. James signed the letter.  Mr. Damman signed next to Mr. James’
    signature.  Next to the words
    “Confirmation of Agreement” at the bottom of the letter, Mr. Stubbs signed the
    letter and dated it July 20, 2006.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to fulfill his employment duties, Mr. Stubbs
    and Ms. Kelly moved to Leamington, Ontario, in September 2006.  Ms. Kelly was also an employee of ATS Canada and
    ATS US.  ATS Canada operated from their
    home in Leamington.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under Mr. Stubbs’ leadership, ATV NA became
    profitable.  However, at Mr. James’ direction,
    money from ATS NA was repatriated to ATS International.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April of 2009, Mr. James pushed for a different
    business focus for ATS NA.  Mr. Stubbs
    disagreed with the new focus for a number of reasons, including that it
    required substantial sums of money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stubbs was aware of the negative financial
    implications of the decisions that were being made by Messrs. James and Damman.  He asked that his shares in ATS
    International, which were held through Foundation, be valued.  Based on Mr. James’ earlier representation
    and method of valuing ATS shares, Mr. Stubbs believed that the oral valuation
    he was given was not fair.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout May and June of 2009, Messrs. James and
    Stubbs disagreed about, among other things, the valuation of his shares and the
    direction in which ATS NA was going.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 26, 2009, each of Mr. Stubbs and Ms. Kelly received
    a letter terminating their employment.  The letters were signed by Mr. James, as President and Group Managing
    Director of ATS Canada, ATS US and ATS International.  The letter to Mr. Stubbs advised that his
    authority and right to act on behalf of ATS generally was removed and that his ATS
    International shares would be automatically offered for sale “according to the
    rules and regulations of the Foundation”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stubbs and Ms. Kelly issued a statement of claim against
    all four defendants in which they sought damages for, among other things,
    wrongful dismissal, breach of contract and oppressive conduct.  One element of the claim was that the
    defendants had conducted their affairs in a manner that improperly favoured
    their interests over those of Mr. Stubbs.  They alleged that the defendants had managed the affairs of ATS Canada,
    ATS US and ATS International, so as to move profits out of ATS Canada, and that
    ATS International underfunded the ATS subsidiaries.  They also sought an order directing Foundation
    to purchase Mr. Stubbs’ shares in ATS International for the Canadian equivalent
    of 390,000 euros.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ATS Canada and ATS US filed statements of defence and
    counterclaim.  Pursuant to art. 10.5 of
    the Plan, they claimed the right to set off any amounts they owed to Mr. Stubbs
    against the share sale proceeds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 4, 2009, Foundation advised Mr. Stubbs
    that his shares had been automatically offered for sale and that the sale
    proceeds totalled 116,435.26 euros.  However,
    in a letter dated October 5, 2009, written on behalf of the Committee of
    Foundation, Mr. Damman advised that pursuant to art. 10.5 of the Plan,
    Foundation would hold the share sale proceeds until the parties’ competing
    claims in this proceeding had been determined.  The letter stated that the request to Foundation to hold the share sale
    proceeds was made by ATS Canada and ATS US.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants moved to set aside the service <i>ex juris </i>of the statement of claim and
    to stay the action as against them.  They
    claimed that there was no “real and substantial” connection between Ontario and
    them.  To the extent that the claims in
    the action related to shares in ATS International, the appellants argued that
    the forum selection clause in art. 10.7 of the Plan should govern.  Article 10.7 provides that any disputes relating

lang=EN-US>The motions judge dismissed the
    motion on the basis that both ATS International and Foundation have a real and
    substantial connection to Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS FOR DECISION
    BELOW</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
    respect of ATS International, the motions judge began by noting that</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span>all of the correspondence initiating the respondents’ employment
    was signed by Mr. James on behalf of ATS International, ATS Canada and ATS US.  Further, the letters of termination to both respondents
    were signed by Mr. James on behalf of all of the companies.  The motions judge next noted that by
    attorning to the jurisdiction, ATS Canada and ATS US effectively conceded that
    if there had been a breach of the employment contract, it occurred in Ontario.  He noted, as well, that the respondents’
    pleadings allege that ATS International directed certain acts by ATS Canada and
    ATS US, both of whom counterclaimed against the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge found that these facts indicate that
    the employment contracts could have been breached in Ontario and “compel” the
    appearance of ATS International in Ontario under rule 17.02(f)(iv).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the motions judge found that ATS
    International is a necessary and proper party to a proceeding properly brought
    against the other defendants, who had been properly served in Ontario under
    rule 17.02(o).  In this regard, the
    motions judge observed that: (1) para. 36(b) of the Statement of Claim alleges
    that ATS International underfunded ATS Canada and ATS US thereby causing the
    acts complained of in their counterclaim; and (2) paras. 36(a) and (c) allege
    that ATS International profited to Mr. Stubbs’ detriment.  Accordingly, the motions judge found that ATS
    International had a real and substantial connection to Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge further found that the factors
    considered in relation to forum non conveniens favour the respondents.  He concluded that it was in the interest of
    justice to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings and that all of the defendants
    should be heard at the same time in the same forum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In deciding whether the Ontario courts should assume
    jurisdiction over Foundation, the motions judge accepted that the choice of law
    and forum agreed to by the parties was a dominant factor.  However, relying on the recent decision of
    this court in <i>Expedition Helicopters Inc.
    v. Honeywell Inc.</i> (2010), 100 O.R. (3d) 241, he noted that the court has
    the discretion to assume jurisdiction, depending on the circumstances of the
    case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the circumstances of this case, the
    motions judge noted that Mr. Stubbs bought ATS shares from Foundation as part
    of his employment contract and the Plan requires the shares to be resold to
    Foundation when his employment ended.  While Foundation repurchased the shares, it held them as security for
    the counterclaim brought against Mr. Stubbs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In paras. 17 to 19 of his reasons, the motions judge
    explains why Foundation has a real and substantial connection to Ontario, such
    that the court should assume jurisdiction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17.  In my
    view, although the Foundation may have originally had no real and substantial
    connection to Ontario, its withholding of the proceeds of the shares to the
    potential benefit of [ATS Canada and ATS US], on their counterclaim and to the
    disadvantage of the plaintiff, gives the Foundation a real and substantial
    connection to Ontario.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>18.  While I
    must concede that each corporate entity is separate from each of the other
    corporate entities, the companies themselves must also recognize the
    concept.  When the Foundation withholds the
    proceeds of the sale of Mr. Stubbs’ shares, where there is no provision in the
    contract to do so, it becomes aligned with [ATS Canada and ATS US].  The Foundation appears to be attempting to execute
    against the plaintiffs’ assets before either of [ATS Canada or ATS US] is successful
    in their respective counterclaims.  This
    is contrary to paragraph 5 of the [Plan] which appears to govern this
    situation, and there is no provision that I can see in that paragraph to allow
    this type of execution before judgment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>19.  <i>Fairness therefore dictates that by its
    actions in injecting itself into the counterclaim between the plaintiffs and
    the North American companies, it could reasonably foresee that Ontario would
    assume jurisdiction over it. </i> (See <i>Van Breda v. Village Resorts Limited, supra, </i>at para. 89.)  Assuming that the
    plaintiff is correct in his claim that the Foundation undervalued his shares,
    it would be unfair to force him into another jurisdiction to relitigate the
    issue. (<i>Van Breda</i>, p. 93)  Bringing the Foundation into this jurisdiction
    on that issue would also avoid the possibility of inconsistencies in the final
    result, and bind the Foundation to the Ontario judgment. [emphasis added]</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>            <b><i>The Relevant Legal Principles</i></b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court recently reconsidered the question of
    when Ontario courts should assume jurisdiction over out-of-province
    defendants.  In <span class=term0><i>Van
    Breda</i></span><i> v. Village Resorts Limited</i> (2010), 98 O.R. (3d) 721, Sharpe J.A., writing for the court,
    described a two-stage analysis that courts are to follow.  First, the court should determine whether the
    claim falls within a connection specified in rule 17.02 – excepting subrules
    (h) and (o) – to determine whether a real and substantial connection with
    Ontario should be presumed to exist.  If
    one of the connections is made out, the defendant bears the burden of showing
    that a real and substantial connection does not exist.&nbsp;  If one of those connections is not made out,
    the burden falls on the plaintiff to demonstrate that, in the particular
    circumstances of the case, the real and substantial test is met.<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the second stage, in determining whether
    there is a real and substantial connection the “core” of the analysis rests on
    the connection between Ontario and the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant,
    respectively.  The remaining considerations
    are not to be treated as independent factors having more or less equal weight
    when determining whether there is a real and substantial connection but,
    rather, as general legal principles that bear on the analysis.  Consideration of the fairness of assuming or
    refusing jurisdiction is a necessary tool in assessing the strength of the
    connections between the forum and the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant.  However, fairness is not a free-standing
    factor capable of trumping weak connections, subject only to the forum of
    necessity exception.<a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When assessing the connection between the forum
    and the defendant, the primary focus is on things done by the defendant within
    the jurisdiction.  Where the defendant
    confines its activities to its home jurisdiction, it will not ordinarily be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the forum.  However, physical presence or activity within the jurisdiction is not
    always required.  Where a defendant could
    reasonably foresee that its conduct would cause harm within the forum,
    jurisdiction may be assumed.<a href="#_ftn3"

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court also recently considered the
    principles that apply when considering whether to enforce a forum selection clause:
    see<i> Expedition Helicopters Inc. v.
    Honeywell Inc.</i>  At para. 24, Juriansz
    J.A., writing on behalf of the court, stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A forum selection clause in a commercial contract
    should be given effect.  The factors that
    may justify departure from that general principle are few.  The few factors that might be considered
    include the plaintiff was induced to agree to the clause by fraud or improper
    inducement or the contract is otherwise unenforceable, the court in the
    selected forum does not accept jurisdiction or otherwise is unable to deal with
    the claim, the claim or the circumstances that have arisen are outside of what
    was reasonably contemplated by the parties when they agreed to the clause, the
    plaintiff can no longer expect a fair trial in the selected forum due to
    subsequent events that could not have been reasonably anticipated, or enforcing
    the clause in the particular case would frustrate some clear public
    policy.  Apart from circumstances such as
    these, a forum selection clause in a commercial contract should be enforced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to consider these principles as they apply
    to ATS International and Foundation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <b><i>Application
    to ATS International </i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although not phrased in precisely these terms, the motions
    judge found that presumptive jurisdiction over ATS International was
    established because the action falls within a connection specified in rule 17.02(f)(iv),
    a breach of contract committed in Ontario.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts alleged by the respondents are that ATS
    International was a party to the employment contracts and those contracts have
    been allegedly breached in Ontario.  Mr.
    James, as a directing mind of ATS International, was the individual who initially
    hired the respondents.  It was Mr. James
    who offered Mr. Stubbs the position of CEO of the North American ATS
    subsidiaries.  It was Mr. James who
    signed all of the correspondence initiating the respondents’ employment on behalf
    of ATS International, as well as ATS Canada and ATS US.  And it was Mr. James, on behalf of ATS
    International, ATS Canada and ATS US, who terminated the respondents’
    employment.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  Furthermore, in the termination letter to Mr.
    Stubbs, “M.P. James, President and Group Managing Director, ATS Applied Tech
    Systems Inc., ATS Applied Tech Systems LLC, ATS International BV” stated that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The
    shareholders and Directors of ATS International BV</i> have subsequently
    replaced your position as Vice President Strategic Business Development for
    both of the above organizations and removed all authorities and rights to act
    on behalf of any of these companies or act in the name of ATS generally.
    [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, art. 10.2 of the Plan gives the “Company” the
    right to terminate an employee’s employment and “Company” is defined as ATS
    International.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In my view, it
    was open to the motions judge to also have found that ATS International,
    through its employee Mr. Stubbs and its subsidiaries, was carrying on business
    in Ontario.  Accordingly, jurisdiction
    could have been presumed also because the case falls within a connection
    specified in rule 17.02(p).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, even if ATS International does not
    carry on business in Ontario, I agree with the motions judge that ATS
    International is a necessary and proper party to this proceeding based on rule
    17.02(o).  While that subrule does not
    give the court presumptive jurisdiction, in my view, the respondents proved a
    real and substantial connection between ATS International and Ontario under the
    second stage of the <i>Van Breda </i>analysis.  ATS International’s actions are a critical
    aspect of Mr. Stubbs’ oppression claim, his claim as to the causes of the financial
    difficulties experienced by the ATS NA companies, and his reply and defence to
    the counterclaims made by ATS Canada and ATS US.  Further, the respondents are residents of
    Ontario and worked under an employment contract allegedly breached in
    Ontario.  Thus, the claim against ATS
    International for wrongful dismissal relates to damages suffered in Ontario.        </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>Application to Foundation </span></i></h4>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Foundation
    stands in a different position than ATS International.  As Foundation is located in the Netherlands,
    never engaged in any direct conduct in Ontario, is not a party to any contract
    with the respondents and has never carried on business in Ontario, there is no
    presumption of a real and substantial connection in respect of Foundation that arises
    at the first stage of the <i>Van Breda </i>analysis.  Moreover, the claim against Foundation
    relates to the shares that Mr. Stubbs owned in ATS International and which are governed
    by the Plan.  It will be recalled that art.
    10.7 of the Plan contains a forum selection clause in favour of the
    Netherlands.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless,
    I would not disturb the motions judge’s determination that there is a real and
    substantial connection that empowers the court to take jurisdiction over
    Foundation.  Why?  In a nutshell, because the shares play a
    critical role in this lawsuit and Foundation plays a critical role in respect
    of the shares.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Stubbs purchased the shares in ATS International as part of his initial
    employment with ATS International.  Those
    shares were held through Foundation.  They are clearly linked to Mr. Stubbs’ employment with ATS
    International, ATS Canada and ATS US.  However, the shares are not a discrete, severable aspect of his
    employment or his compensation.  Rather,
    the shares have played a critical role throughout the parties’ relationship:
    before, during, at the end and afterwards.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
    the employment relationship – It appears that as a condition of employment, Mr.
    Stubbs was required to purchase the shares.  He says that he purchased them based on untrue representations and that
    his investment, by means of purchasing the shares, was critical to the
    continued existence of ATS International.  However, Foundation’s role in the share purchase is unclear.  Who set the price of the shares
    initially?  Foundation, ATS International
    or the directing minds of ATS International, who also appear to be the
    Committee running Foundation?  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
    the employment relationship – The valuation of the shares continued to play a
    part in the employment relationship.  In
    2009, when Mr. Stubbs asked that his shares be valued, he was given a valuation
    that he believed was unfair.  Tensions
    between him and Mr. James over the valuation of the shares contributed to the
    breakdown of the employment relationship.  Part of Mr. Stubbs’ claim relates to his allegation that the valuation
    was wrongly manipulated by the defendants, including Foundation, over the
    course of his employment.  How was the
    valuation done and who performed it?  Was
    it Foundation, ATS International or the directing minds of ATS International,
    who also appear to be the Committee running Foundation?   </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the end of the employment relationship – The dispute over the valuation of the
    shares is clearly linked to the termination of Mr. Stubbs’ employment.  It is also a critical component of his rights
    on termination.  When ATS terminated Mr.
    Stubbs’ employment, it advised him that his shares would be automatically
    offered for sale by Foundation.  Apparently
    that process has already occurred but it is unclear how the share price was
    determined.  Was it by Foundation, ATS
    International or the directing minds of ATS International, who also appear to
    be the Committee running Foundation?</span></p>

    the employment relationship – At the request of ATS Canada and ATS US, Foundation
    has retained the share sale proceeds, pending the disposition of this action.  Foundation’s involvement in withholding the

    over Foundation.    </span></p>

    agree with the motions judge that fairness considerations in assessing the
    strength of the connections also support the assumption of jurisdiction against
    Foundation.  As he noted, forcing the
    respondents to relitigate issues relating to the shares in another jurisdiction
    creates the possibility of inconsistent results.  More significantly, in the circumstances of
    this case, it would be like trying to unscramble an egg because the shares are
    enmeshed in the relationship among these parties.  Finally, it is worth noting that the forum
    selection clause did not originate in Mr. Stubbs’ employment contract.  The clause is contained in the Plan, a
    document that predates his employment with ATS International.        </span></p>

    case arises in an employment context, rather than a commercial situation where
