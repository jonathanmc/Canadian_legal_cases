  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a law firm that was retained on a
    contingency fee basis to act for clients in relation to a dispute between the clients
    and their franchisor. While litigation was ongoing between the clients and
    their franchisor, the clients retained the respondents, Ben Vladlen Hanuka and
    Davis Moldaver LLP (the “successor lawyers”), to act for them in place of the
    appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue on appeal is whether the motion judge
    erred in striking out the appellant’s claim against the successor lawyers for inducing
    breach of contract and intentional interference with economic interests for
    failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Background </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s statement of claim sets out the
    following basic chronology: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 19, 2007, the appellant was retained on
    a contingency fee basis to act for Thakar Baweja, Rajiv Baweja and 6369162
    Canada Inc. (the “former clients”) in relation to a dispute between the former clients
    and their franchisor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Among other things, the October 19, 2007 retainer
    agreement between the appellant and the former clients required that the former
    clients pay the appellant $50,000 up front plus 27% of any future judgment or
    settlement proceeds. The retainer agreement also provided that it could be
    terminated within 15 days of the date of the agreement, and “[t]hereafter ...
    only by agreement between the parties or, if required, in accordance with the
    Law Society of Upper Canada Rules of Professional Conduct.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 27, 2007, the appellant issued a
    statement of claim on behalf of the former clients against the former clients’
    franchisor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant carried out the former clients’
    instructions without complaint for approximately two years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On September 25, 2009, the former clients instructed
    the appellant to renegotiate their sublease. On September 29, 2009, the
    appellant notified the former clients that advising them on matters pertaining
    to their sublease was outside the scope of the original retainer agreement but
    offered to enter into a further retainer agreement for that purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 29, 2009, the appellant entered into
    settlement negotiations with the solicitors for the former clients’ franchisor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 6, 2009, the appellant received a
    copy of a letter written by the successor lawyers to the franchisor’s
    solicitors concerning the sublease. The appellant wrote to the successor
    lawyers and expressed concerns that the letter also dealt with matters
    pertaining to the ongoing litigation between the former clients and their
    franchisor. The appellant demanded that the successor lawyers retract and
    clarify their statements to the franchisor’s solicitors or serve a notice of
    change of solicitors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 8, 2009, the former clients sent the
    appellant an e-mail inquiring as to the fees and disbursements incurred to date
    and demanded a copy of the appellant’s dockets. Thereafter, the former clients
    failed to respond to the appellant’s numerous inquiries concerning the former
    clients’ intentions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 16, 2009, the successor lawyers
    served a notice of change of solicitors on the appellant with respect to the
    subject matter of the retainer agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the period between October 2007 and
    November 2009, the appellant accrued approximately $63,998.70 in recorded legal
    fees and actual disbursements including GST in relation to the retainer
    agreement. The appellant delivered an invoice in that amount to the former
    clients on December 7, 2009. As of December 9, 2009, the invoice remained
    unpaid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 9, 2009, the appellant issued a statement
    of claim against the successor lawyers and the former clients. As against the
    successor lawyers, the appellant claimed damages for conspiracy, inducing
    breach of contract and unlawful interference with economic interests, and unjust
    enrichment. In particular, the appellant asserted that the successor lawyers’
    November 6, 2009 correspondence to counsel for the former clients’ franchisor
    “improperly engages in correspondence in connection with the litigation
    proceedings which were the subject of [the appellant’s] retainer.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the appellant asserted that the former clients
    retained the successor lawyers “to escape any liability to [the appellant] as a
    result of the termination of the [October 19, 2007 retainer agreement]” and
    that the successor lawyers “clandestinely enticed and assisted the [former
    clients] to terminate the [October 19, 2007 retainer agreement] without paying
    the amounts due and payable to [the appellant].”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to the appellant’s statement of claim, the
    successor lawyers moved to strike the appellant’s statement of claim under Rules
    21.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) and 25.11 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> as failing to disclose a reasonable cause
    of action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The Motion Judge’s Decision</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a brief endorsement, the motion judge concluded that
    this case is controlled by the decision in <i>Manning
    v. Epp, </i>2006 CanLII 24126 (ON S.C.), affirmed by the Court of Appeal at
    2007 ONCA 390. He therefore dismissed the appellant's claim against the
    successor lawyers on the basis that it could not possibly succeed.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Manning</i>, the
    plaintiff lawyer sued, among others, a mayor and a municipal councillor for
    inducing breach of contract and intentional interference with economic
    relations. The solicitor alleged that the mayor and the municipal councillor wrongfully
    persuaded the municipality to terminate the lawyer’s retainer because the
    lawyer refused to change an opinion he had given to the municipality about a
    particular issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lax J. struck the lawyer’s claim. At para. 20 of her
    reasons, she held that a client has “an absolute and unfettered right to
    discharge a lawyer” and that a “solicitor’s sole economic interest in a
    retainer is having his fees paid for the work he has performed”. Moreover, at
    para. 21 of her reasons, she stated that “[a]ny conduct by [the municipality’s representatives]
    that may have contributed to or influenced the decision cannot give rise to a
    cause of action for harm to economic interests where no economic loss exists.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant indicated its intention to
    abandon its conspiracy claim and focus on its claim for inducing breach of
    contract and intentional interference with economic relations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that, particularly in the context
    of a contingency fee arrangement, a cause of action exists against the
    successor lawyers for causing economic loss to the appellant through an
    unlawful act. As framed in oral argument, the unlawful act alleged is the
    knowing and deliberate participation by the successor lawyers in a scheme to
    assist the former clients in avoiding their obligation to properly compensate
    the appellant for services legitimately rendered under the retainer agreement. The
    appellant contends that the motion judge erred in holding that its cause of
    action as pleaded against the successor lawyers could not possibly succeed. In
    the alternative, the appellant argues that the motion judge erred in failing to
    grant leave to amend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept the appellant's arguments. Even
    assuming that a cause of action as described by the appellant may exist, the
    appellant has failed to plead particulars of any conduct on the part of the
    successor lawyers capable of giving rise to an inference that such a cause of
    action exists in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An examination of the successor lawyers’ November 6,
    2009 letter to counsel for the former clients’ franchisor’s solicitor, reveals
    that the appellant’s allegation that the successor lawyers “improperly
    engage[d] in correspondence in connection with the litigation proceedings which
    were the subject of [the appellant’s] retainer” is without foundation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, there are no facts pleaded in the statement of
    claim that are reasonably capable of supporting an inference that the successor
    lawyers “clandestinely enticed and assisted the [former clients] to terminate
    the [October 19, 2007 retainer agreement] without paying the amounts due and payable
    to [the appellant].” The fact that the former clients changed counsel without
    paying or securing outstanding fees is not, in itself, capable of supporting
    that inference. Although it may be generally desirable that successor law firms
    co-operate in protecting a predecessor law firm’s account, to hold that a
    successor law firm’s failure to make arrangements to do so, standing alone,
    could found a cause of action would trench on a client’s unfettered right to <a
name="_GoBack"></a>change counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no basis for holding that the motion judge erred
    in failing to grant leave to amend. The allegations made by the appellant are
    serious allegations of professional misconduct. No facts were pleaded that are
    capable of supporting those allegations. On the contrary, the statement of
    claim contained bald, unsupported assertions of professional misconduct.
    Further, the appellant has not tendered a draft amended pleading capable of
    supporting its alleged cause of action. The appellant also failed to cite facts
    in oral argument that would support what has been alleged. Leave to amend is
    not justified in these circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the former clients’ absolute right to
    terminate their retainer with the appellant and our conclusions concerning the
    appellant’s claim for inducing breach of contract and intentional interference
    with economic relations, we see no merit in the appellant’s claim for unjust
    enrichment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs to the
    successor lawyers on a substantial indemnity basis, fixed in the amount of $8,488.25,
    inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
