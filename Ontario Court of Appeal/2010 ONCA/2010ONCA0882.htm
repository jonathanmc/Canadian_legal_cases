style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On its face, this seemingly curious case is
    about almost $600,000 in public funds – seemingly curious as each party is
    disclaiming any right to the funds.  However, properly understood, it is neither curious nor about the
    $600,000.  It is a debate about the accounting
    treatment of election expenses, the resolution of which affects general
    election spending limits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The specific question before this Court is
    whether the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada (the “CEO”) is obligated to
    authorize the amendment of two election expenses returns filed on behalf of the
    Conservative Party of Canada.  The answer
    to this question depends on whether the <i>Canada
    Elections Act</i>, S.C. 2000, c. 9 (the “<i>Elections
    Act” </i>or the “Act”)<i> </i>requires that
    general election expenses be reported in accordance with Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The question arises because in 2008 the Party
    received rebates under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, of Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) it had paid for taxable
    supplies associated with the 2004 and 2006 general elections.  If GAAP applies and the election expenses
    returns can be amended, the result will effectively be that political parties in
    receipt of such rebates will benefit by an increase in their legislatively
    available election spending.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the application judge’s interpretation of the
    relevant legislation, he concluded that GAAP applies to election expenses
    returns and that the Conservative Fund Canada, which brought the application on
    behalf of the Party, is entitled to amend the two election expenses returns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, the CEO submits that the application
    judge erred in allowing the amendments.  His analysis was based on an interpretation of the <i>Elections Act</i> that is contrary not only to the plain reading of the
    relevant provisions of the Act, but also to Parliament’s intention to give
    every political party a fair chance to have its message heard or, as it is
    often called, to provide for a level political playing field. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree, and would allow the appeal for the
    reasons that follow.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before turning to the applicable legislative
    provisions, I believe it will assist if I explain certain accounting terms
    relevant to the dispute between the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GAAP is a term used to refer to the conventions,
    rules and procedures that define approved accounting practices at a particular
    time.  The principles include not only
    broad guidelines of general application, but also detailed practices and procedures,
    and are used by accountants in the preparation of financial statements:  Bryan A. Garner, ed., <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 8th ed. (St. Paul: West, 2004). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Generally accepted auditing standards (“GAAS”)
    is a term that refers to guidelines that establish the professional qualities
    of an auditor and the criteria to be used in an auditor’s examination of
    financial records and the accompanying audit reports:  <i>Black’s
    Law Dictionary</i>, 8th <span class=GramE>ed</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As can be seen from these definitions, the
    difference between the two is that GAAP is what organizations must follow while
    preparing financial statements and GAAS is what auditors must follow during an
    engagement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is of note that a requirement for an auditor
    to apply GAAS does not indicate whether or not the financial records that are
    being examined must be prepared in accordance with GAAP.  According to the handbook of the Canadian
    Institute of Chartered Accountants, reporting standards under GAAS include that
    “[w]here an opinion is expressed, it should indicate whether the financial statements
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows in accordance with Canadian generally accepted
    accounting principles” except when the statements are prepared on a different
    basis, as described in the auditor’s report (Canadian Institute of Chartered
    Accountants, <i>CICA Handbook</i> (Toronto:
    CICA, 2010), at s. 5100.02).  Thus, GAAS
    neither mandates, nor excludes, GAAP.</p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As correctly identified by the application
    judge, the key to the resolution of this matter involves the interpretation of
    the election expense provisions contained in the <i>Elections Act</i> and the interplay between those provisions and the
    GST rebates provided to certain qualifying organizations under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>.  I will therefore start with a relatively
    extensive review of the legislative framework.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Elections
    Act</i> is the statute that regulates all aspects of elections and
    by-elections.  The Act contains a number
    of important features that are relevant to this appeal.</p>
  <h3>Election spending limits and monitoring</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One important aspect of the <i>Elections Act</i> is that it limits election spending.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 422 of the Act sets out a spending limit
    that applies uniformly to all political parties.  It is calculated based on the number of
    registered electors in electoral districts in which the registered party has
    endorsed a candidate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 423 prohibits a party from incurring “election
    expenses” that exceed the limit calculated in accordance with this
    formula.  Election expenses are broadly
    defined in s. 407 of the Act to include any costs incurred, whether paid or
    unpaid, or any non-monetary contributions received, by a registered party that
    are used to directly promote or oppose a registered party, its leader or a
    candidate during an election period.  Under
    para. 497(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>l), it is an offence for the chief agent
    of a registered political party to incur expenses that exceed the statutory
    limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To enable the CEO to monitor election expenses
    and to ensure parties adhere to the spending limits, s. 429 of the <i>Elections Act</i> requires the chief agent of
    a registered party to provide an election expenses return to the CEO when a
    general election has been held. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, the party’s auditor is required,
    pursuant to s. 430 of the Act, to examine the general election expenses return
    in accordance with GAAS and to report to the party’s chief agent.  This report must be included in the party’s
    general election expenses return.  Section 430 requires the auditor’s report to include an opinion as to
    whether the return presents fairly the information contained in the financial
    records on which the return is based.  In
    its current form, there is no mention of GAAP in s. 430.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, that was not the case between 2000 and
    2004.  At that time, the wording of s.
    430(1) expressly required the auditor to provide an opinion in his or her
    report as to whether the financial records supporting the election expenses
    return were prepared in accordance with GAAP.  It was only in 2004, with the introduction of significant changes to the
    rules pertaining to political financing, that the reference to GAAP in s.
    430(1) was removed.  </p>
  <h3>Other financial reporting requirements</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to filing election expenses returns,
    registered political parties must file a financial transactions return for each
    fiscal period, pursuant to s. 424 of the <i>Elections
    Act</i>.  Sections 424(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>f) and (g) stipulate that a financial transactions return
    must provide a statement of the party’s assets and liabilities and any surplus
    or deficit, and a statement of the party’s revenues and expenses, all in
    accordance with GAAP.  Section 424(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>i) requires an election expenses return for each by-election
    during the fiscal period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant to s. 426(1), an auditor must examine
    the political party’s financial transactions return in accordance with GAAS and
    provide an opinion as to whether the return presents fairly the information
    contained in the party’s financial records.  Section 426(2) requires the auditor to include any statement considered
    necessary if the financial transactions return does not present fairly and in
    accordance with GAAP the information in the financial records on which it is
    based.  Notably, there was a reference to
    GAAP in s. 426(1) that was removed at the same time as that in s. 430(1);
    however, the reference to GAAP in s. 426(2) was retained.</p>
  <h3>Corrections of returns</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A chief agent may apply to the CEO to correct a
    financial transactions return or an election expenses return under s. 433(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b).  The CEO may
    authorize the correction under s. 433(3) of the <i>Elections Act</i>, based on, among other reasons, an honest mistake of
    fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the CEO rejects an application to correct a
    general election expenses return, s. 434 of the Act permits the registered party
    to apply to a judge for an order authorizing the correction.  Section 434(3)(c) provides that the judge may
    not grant the order sought unless satisfied that the application was brought due
    to one of the factors in s. 433(3), including an honest mistake of fact.</p>
  <h3>Public funding of political parties under the <i>Elections Act</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another important aspect of the <i>Elections Act</i> is that it provides for
    government subsidies to registered political parties.  For example, under s. 435 of the Act, a
    registered political party may qualify for a reimbursement of 50% of its paid
    election expenses as stated on the general election expenses return, if certain
    criteria are met.  This reimbursement
    rate was increased from 22.5%, as of January 1, 2004, with an exceptional rate
    of 60% reimbursement set for the first general election following January 1,
    2004.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under the current <i>Excise Tax Act</i> regime, tax relief is available to organizations
    that meet the definition of a “qualifying non-profit organization” (“QNPO”).  Pursuant to s. 259, a QNPO is eligible to
    receive a rebate of 50% of the GST that it has paid on the acquisition of
    taxable supplies.  A registered political
    party may qualify as a QNPO and become eligible for GST relief if its income
    from governmental sources constitutes at least 40% of its total income for that
    year.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The increases in government subsidies to
    registered political parties, added in the 2003 amendments to the <i>Elections Act</i> and effective as of
    January 1, 2004, have allowed some registered political parties to qualify for
    GST rebates under s. 259 of the <i>Excise
    Tax Act</i>.  Not all registered
    political parties qualify as <span class=GramE>QNPOs,</span> however, as
    qualification depends on the amount of public funding a party receives compared
    to its private funding.  Parties may
    qualify and cease to qualify over time depending on their electoral performance
    and the amount of money they raise from private donations in any given
    year.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    quarterly payments under s. 435.01 of the <i>Elections
    Act</i> will meet the requirements for QNPO status.  Each of the five largest registered parties
    in Canada (the Party, the Liberal Party, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois,
    and the Green Party) presently qualifies for quarterly payments and had 50% of
    its paid election expenses from the last general election reimbursed.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While that is the current system, it is also
    important to understand the prior rules governing political parties under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> for purposes of this
    appeal.  As part of its argument, the
    Fund relies on a position taken by the CEO concerning the former rules.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to amendments to the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> that came into effect in <span class=GramE>1997,</span> political parties had an option to treat their activities as similar in nature
    to a business engaged in the production of taxable supplies.  A political party that opted for this
    treatment would collect GST on the sale of party memberships, just as a
    business would collect GST on the sale of taxable supplies.  Like a business, the political party would
    then be entitled to claim an income tax credit (“ITC”) for any tax paid on the
    goods and services purchased by the party that could be related to taxable
    supplies – for the political party<span class=GramE>,  ITCs</span> are the mechanism by which the
    ultimate burden for GST is placed on the final consumer of the goods and
    services.  By allowing intermediaries
    along the supply and production chain to offset their tax paid on their inputs
    against the tax they collect from their customers, a cascade of tax is avoided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the context of this ITC regime, the CEO took
    the position in a letter dated May 29, 1996, to legal counsel for the
    Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, that the P.C. Party’s election
    expenses returns should be retroactively adjusted to reflect expenses net of
    the GST recovered through ITCs, and that the P.C. Party’s reimbursement under
    the <i>Elections Act</i> would be
    correspondingly adjusted to reflect the lower expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequent to this letter, amendments to the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> came into effect in 1997.  These amendments added the “supply of a
    membership in a registered party” to the list of exempt supplies under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>.  Accordingly, registered political parties
    could no longer be considered to be providing “taxable supplies”, so they could
    no longer claim ITCs in respect of the GST paid on any purchases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In summary, the ITC regime no longer applies to
    registered political parties.  However,
    under the current regime, political parties that qualify as QNPOs receive a
    partial rebate of their GST.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As required by s. 429 of the <i>Elections Act</i>, the Fund provided the CEO
    with the Party’s general election expenses returns in respect of the June 2004
    and January 2006 elections.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In accordance with these returns, under s. 435
    of the <i>Act</i>, the Party qualified for
    and received from the Consolidated Revenue Fund a reimbursement of 60% of its
    election expenses as stated on its return for the June 2004 election, and 50%
    of its expenses for the January 2006 election.  These expenses included an amount that the Party had paid in GST for the
    goods and services relating to the two elections.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From 2005 to 2007, the Party was in discussion
    with the Canada Revenue Agency regarding its eligibility as a QNPO.  In March 2007, the Party was advised that it
    did qualify and that the decision was retroactive to January 2004.  As a result, in April 2008, the Party
    received a rebate of 50% of the GST it paid from January 2004 to January
    2007.  This rebate included 50% of the
    GST that the Party paid in relation to taxable goods and services associated
    with the general elections held in June 2004 and January 2006. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Fund then took the position that the Party’s
    general election expenses returns for these two elections overstated its
    expenses by the amount of the GST rebate and, as a result, the Party had received
    a government subsidy for its election expenses to which it was not
    entitled.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, by letter dated June 26, 2008, the
    Fund sought authorization from the CEO, pursuant to s. 433(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    of the <i>Elections Act</i>, to amend its
    election expenses returns to reflect the reduction in its expenses by the
    amount of the GST rebate.  The proposed
    basis for the correction was an honest mistake of fact (s. 433(3)(c)), in that
    the Fund did not know when it submitted its election expenses returns that the
    Party was a QNPO, eligible for a GST rebate under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>.  The Fund
    attached “corrected” election expenses returns for the 2004 and 2006 general
    elections, reflecting a reduction in election expenses due to the GST
    rebates.  The Fund proposed, upon
    confirmation of their acceptance by the CEO, to repay to the Receiver General
    for Canada the amount that it believed it was overpaid under s. 435 of the <i>Elections Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On December 2, 2008, the CEO advised by letter
    that he would not authorize the Fund’s requested correction.  The basis for the refusal was that the GST
    rebate had no effect on the reporting of election expenses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly thereafter, the CEO issued a memorandum
    regarding the use of GST/HST rebates in which he advised all registered
    political parties of his position in this regard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding the CEO’s December 2 letter, the
    Fund once again submitted “corrected” general election expenses returns for the
    2004 and 2006 general elections to the CEO by letter dated June 30, 2009, and
    requested a reconsideration of the CEO’s position.  By letter dated July 29, 2009, the CEO rejected
    the Fund’s request to correct its returns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 12, 2009, the Fund commenced an
    application in the Superior Court, pursuant to s. 434(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    of the <i>Elections Act</i>, for an order
    authorizing the proposed corrections.  If
    it were so authorized, it planned to reimburse the Receiver General for Canada
    for the overpayment.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge identified the issue as
    being whether the Fund is entitled to an order correcting the two general
    election expenses returns to reflect a reduction in expenses by the amount of
    the GST rebate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He attributed no significance to the retroactive
    nature of the payment that triggered the Fund’s request for a correction.  While the issue had arisen in the context of
    retroactive payments, it had to be “approached as a matter of interpretation on
    the basis that the issue applies on a going-forward basis to future elections,
    also having retrospective effect because the [Fund] did not know that it was a
    QNPO as of the original date of filing of the general election expenses returns
    for the 2004 and 2006 general elections.”    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge gave four reasons for his
    conclusion that the <i>Elections Act</i> requires that a political party report its expenses in its general election
    expenses return in accordance with GAAP and therefore net of any GST rebate.  He did so by setting out the four principal
    arguments advanced by the CEO and rejecting each of them in turn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, following a three-stage analysis, he
    rejected the CEO’s argument that nothing in the <i>Elections Act</i> expressly requires or permits the deduction of a GST
    rebate from the general election expenses reported under s. 429.  He determined that the plain reading of the
    applicable provisions in the <i>Elections
    Act</i> supports the conclusion that election expenses reported on general
    election expenses returns be reported in accordance with GAAP:    </p>
  <p class=ParaNoIndent>(1)  Section 424
    requires an annual filing of a financial transactions return that sets out the
    party’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses for each fiscal year, all in
    accordance with GAAP.  Section 426(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) requires an auditor reviewing the return to include a
    statement if, in his or her opinion, the return does not present the
    information from the party’s financial records in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore, financial transactions returns
    must be prepared in accordance with GAAP;</p>
  <p class=ParaNoIndent>(2)  Since
    by-election expenses are included in the total expenses reported in the
    financial transactions return for the year in which they are incurred, they
    must be reported in accordance with GAAP in the financial transactions
    return.  Section 424 requires a separate
    by-election expenses return to be filed for any by-election during the fiscal
    year.  In the absence of any indication
    to the contrary in s. 424, by-election expenses returns must also be reported
    in accordance with GAAP, to the extent that GAAP applies to such expenses.  There is no basis for presenting general
    election expenses differently than by-election expenses, so it follows that
    general election expenses also have to be reported in accordance with
    GAAP.  This conclusion is reinforced by
    the fact that an auditor’s report is required in respect of both financial
    transactions returns and general election expenses returns.  While s. 430 does not contain language
    similar to s. 426, which explicitly requires the auditor to opine on whether
    the presentation of the financial information accords with GAAP, this does not
    mean that a general election expenses return ought not to be prepared in
    accordance with GAAP.  The imposition of
    a separate requirement of an audit opinion for general election expenses other
    than in accordance with GAAP would impose an unnecessary cost on political
    parties; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNoIndent>(3)  Similarly, if
    general election expenses were to be reported in the general election expenses
    return in a manner other than in accordance with GAAP, a political party would
    be required to maintain two sets of books in respect of the same financial
    information:  one for the financial
    transactions return (in accordance with GAAP) and one for the general election
    expenses return (on a different basis of accounting).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge proceeded from his
    conclusion that election expenses had to be reported in accordance with GAAP to
    find that they had to be reported net of recoverable GST.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, he rejected the CEO’s position that
    there was a policy distinction in the <i>Excise
    Tax Act</i> between the ITC regime and the GST rebate provisions that would
    justify treating the former as a reduction of GST and the latter as a form of
    subsidy.  Therefore, he agreed with the
    Fund that the CEO’s position in the 1996 letter, that election expenses returns
    should reflect expenses net of the GST recovered through ITCs, was also
    applicable under the QNPO system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the application judge rejected the CEO’s argument
    that the Fund’s position would create a lack of harmony between the <i>Elections Act</i> and the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>.  While accepting the Fund’s position that GST
    rebates should be reflected on election expenses returns would require a
    correction of the Party’s previously filed returns, the <i>Elections Act</i> specifically contemplates and provides for filings to
    be corrected, and accrual accounting should remove the need to file correcting
    returns after the receipt of any future GST rebate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge acknowledged the
    theoretical possibility of the “endless paradoxical loop” suggested by the CEO,
    in which a party would lose QNPO status at the end of a year due to the receipt
    of a GST rebate under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> and the corresponding reduction in election expenses reimbursement under the <i>Elections Act</i>, which could reduce the
    party’s government funding to below 40 per cent.  However, he downplayed the possibility of
    such an occurrence and held that to the extent there was any disharmony between
    the two statutes for these or other imaginable practical reasons, this lack of
    harmony could not be used to infer Parliament’s intention to treat GST rebates
    in the manner proposed by the CEO.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, while the application judge agreed that
    the Fund’s interpretation of the Act benefits political parties that are QNPOs
    by essentially increasing the otherwise applicable spending limits by the
    amount of the GST rebate, he held that this did not evidence Parliament’s
    intention that election expenses be treated in accordance with the CEO’s
    position.  First, he concluded that while
    the policy of creating a level playing field for political parties is an
    important objective of the <i>Elections Act</i>,
    the Act does not invariably give supremacy to that policy.  Second, the CEO’s position would allow a
    political party that qualified as a QNPO to be unjustly enriched by receiving
    both a 50% GST rebate under the <i>Excise
    Tax Act</i> and a reimbursement of 50% of its GST expenses under the <i>Elections Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the basis of the application judge’s
    conclusion that general election expenses had to be reported net of GST
    rebates, he held that the Fund was entitled to an order under s. 434(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the Act allowing the proposed corrections to the
    Party’s general election expenses returns for the 2004 and 2006 general

lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The CEO submits that the application judge erred
    in all four of the reasons he gave for concluding that the <i>Elections Act</i> requires that general election expenses must be
    reported in accordance with GAAP and thus net of GST rebates. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the CEO argues that the plain wording of
    the Act does not support that conclusion.  Moreover, when other principles of statutory interpretation are applied,
    it is clear that the legislative drafters deliberately omitted a GAAP reporting
    requirement for general election expenses returns.  For example, the CEO points to the
    legislative history of the removal of the GAAP reporting requirement from the
    auditor’s report in s. 430, as outlined above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the CEO submits that the application
    judge erred in<i> </i>failing to recognize
    that GST rebates are intended as subsidies and therefore there is an important
    policy distinction between GST rebates and ITCs, which are simply a mechanism
    to administer the GST regime.  The CEO therefore
    contends that the position taken by his predecessor in the May 1996 letter, requiring
    adjustment of election expenses returns to reflect ITCs, does not apply to the
    present situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the CEO submits that the application
    judge erred in failing to recognize that his interpretation creates a lack of
    harmony between the two statutes, as a subsidy provided to a QNPO under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> would result in
    government funding provided under the <i>Elections
    Act</i> having to be returned.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth, the CEO submits that the application
    judge erred in failing to recognize that Parliament has deliberately chosen an
    approach to levelling the playing field among political parties that focuses more
    on limiting how much registered political parties can spend during an election
    cycle than on how much they receive by way of government subsidy.  Moreover, according to the CEO, the Act
    requires all expenses, including the full amount of the GST, to be reported at
    “commercial value”, ensuring that expenses are reported equally by all
    parties.  The CEO argues that the application
    judge’s interpretation, which allows some parties to report election expenses
    other than at commercial value, undermines Parliament’s intention to promote
    the egalitarian model of elections. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In response to the CEO’s submission on
    legislative history, the Fund notes that the same change that was made to s.
    430(1) was also made to s. 426(1), in relation to financial transactions returns.
     The Fund argues therefore that the
    significance the CEO attributes to the change to s. 430 does not assist its
    argument.  The Fund contends that this
    change was not because GAAP does not apply with respect to election expenses
    returns, but rather because it cannot apply to non-monetary donations, a
    feature of election expenses that is not relevant in the financial transactions
    return.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Fund submits that the ordinary meaning of
    the provisions of the Act makes it clear that election expenses should be
    reported net of GST rebates in a general election expenses return.  The Fund notes that s. 429 requires an
    election expenses return to set out expenses “incurred” by a registered party
    and argues that GST that is initially paid but subsequently rebated is not an
    expense that has been “incurred”.  The
    Fund also points to s. 435 of the Act, which provides for the reimbursement of
    50% of “paid” election expenses, and argues that if GST rebates are ignored in
    the election expenses return, a party will be reimbursed for GST that was not
    in fact “paid”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Fund also submits that the application judge
    was correct in determining that there is no meaningful policy distinction
    between ITCs and GST rebates for QNPOs; the economic result is the same under
    either regime, with the GST initially paid rebated back to a registered party.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In response to the CEO’s policy arguments, the
    Fund submits that Parliament deliberately contributed toward an uneven playing
    field in the <i>Elections Act</i> by
    providing unequal public funding of parties, depending on their electoral
    success.  Further, the small spending
    advantage given to QNPO parties under the Fund’s interpretation would not
    enable these parties to control the electoral process or overwhelm the voices
    of non-QNPO registered parties. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the following reasons, I do not agree with
    the application judge that, based on the plain meaning of the wording of the <i>Elections Act</i>, election expenses
    reported under s. 429 of the Act must be presented in accordance with GAAP and
    therefore net of any GST rebates received under s. 259 of the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I start with the observation that the <i>Elections Act</i> contains no specific
    wording that provides that general election expenses be reported in accordance
    with GAAP.  Rather, s. 430 of the Act,
    which sets out the basis upon which the party’s auditor should evaluate the
    party’s reporting of election expenses as required under s. 429, specifies that
    they be reported “fairly”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>430.  (1) As
    soon as practicable after a general election, the auditor of a registered party
    shall report to its chief agent on its return on general election expenses and
    shall make any examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing
    standards that will enable the auditor to give an opinion in the report as to <i>whether the return presents fairly the
    information contained in the financial records on which the return is based</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) <i>An
    auditor shall include in the report under subsection (1) any statement the
    auditor considers necessary if</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE><i>the</i></span><i> return that is the
    subject of the report does not present fairly the information contained in the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The significance of the omission of any
    reference to GAAP in the general election expenses reporting requirements is
    augmented by the fact that the drafters of the <i>Elections Act</i> did expressly identify certain financial information
    as having to be presented in accordance with GAAP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I refer to the fact that only two of the eleven
    components of the financial transactions return in s. 424(2), that is, the
    statement of the party’s assets and liabilities and the statement of revenues
    and expenses, are explicitly required to be in accordance with GAAP.  It is notable that the reporting requirements
    associated with by-elections found in s. 424(2)(i) make no reference to GAAP:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>424 (2) A financial transactions return must set
    out</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) <span class=GramE>the</span> total

    which is set out above, makes no reference to an auditor’s having to indicate
    if the return does not present the information contained in the financial
    records in accordance with GAAP.  In
    contrast, its parallel provision, s. 426(2)(a), dealing with the requirements
    of an auditor’s report concerning a registered political party’s annual
    financial transactions return, specifically requires an auditor to report if
    the financial information is not presented in accordance with GAAP:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>426.  (1) The
    auditor of a registered party shall report to the party’s chief agent on the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, as the CEO points out, some
    significance must be attached to the 2003 amendments to the <i>Elections Act</i> that changed s. 430(1) to
    remove the requirement that the auditor make an inquiry in accordance with
    GAAP.  As noted above, while both s.
    426(1) and s. 430(1) were similarly amended to remove this requirement, it is
    significant that this change left no further reference to GAAP in s. 430, whereas
    s. 426(2) still refers to GAAP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These observations engage the statutory
    interpretation principle of implied exclusion.  Professor Sullivan explains that the implied exclusion argument lies
    whenever there is reason to believe that if the legislature had meant to
    include a particular thing within the ambit of its legislation, it would have
    referred to that thing expressly:  Ruth
    Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of
    Statutes</i>, 5th ed. (Markham:  LexisNexis, 2008), at p. 244. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In other words, deliberate legislative exclusion
    can be implied when an express reference might have been expected but is
    absent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application of this rule makes it difficult
    to accept the application judge’s conclusion that the wording of the <i>Elections Act</i> indicates Parliament’s
    intention that general election expenses be reported in accordance with GAAP,
    in the light of the fact that the drafters of the <i>Elections Act</i> did not so specify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also reject the Fund’s submissions that the
    ordinary meaning of the words “incurred” in s. 429 and “paid” in s. 435 makes
    it clear that election expenses returns should report election expenses net of
    any GST rebates.  Whether or not GST is
    later rebated to a registered party under the <i>Excise Tax Act,</i> GST is an expense that was “incurred” and “paid” by
    the party at the time of the purchase of taxable goods or services.  I do not find these words helpful to the interpretation
    process.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Significant weight is attached to the importance
    of interpreting legislation in a manner that is in keeping with the object of
    the legislation<i> </i>and with Parliament’s
    intention.  In <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5th ed., Professor Sullivan
    provides helpful assistance with the task of statutory interpretation in terms
    of the relationship between the wording of the statute and the significance of
    Parliament’s intention.  After citing a
    passage from <i>McBratney v. McBratney</i>,
    [1919] 59 S.C.R. 550, at p. 561, she states at p. 281:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this passage Duff C.J. asserts two principles
    that govern judicial reliance on purpose in interpretation.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(1)
    If the ordinary meaning of legislation is ambiguous, the interpretation that
    best accords with the purpose of the legislation should be adopted.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(2)
    If the ordinary meaning is clear, but an alternative interpretation is
    plausible and more in keeping with the purpose, the interpretation that best
    accords with the purpose of the legislation should be adopted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These
    principles are often expressed in negative form:  <i>an
    interpretation that would tend to frustrate or defeat the legislature’s purpose
    should be rejected if there is a plausible alternative</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In terms of the legislative intent of the <i>Elections Act</i>, there is no debate over
    the fact that Parliament has adopted what I have previously referred to as an
    egalitarian model of elections as an essential component of our democracy.  The basic premise of this model is that each
    citizen should have an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral
    process.  This objective has been
    discussed by the Supreme Court in two recent cases - <i>Figueroa v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 912, at
    para. 72, and <i>Harper v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827, at paras. 101-102.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At issue in <i>Figueroa</i> was whether the <i>Elections Act</i> requirement that a political party nominate candidates in at least 50 ridings
    in order to receive and retain registered party status, and the benefits
    incident to that status, interfered with the capacity of individual citizens to
    play a meaningful role in the electoral process.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his analysis, Iacobucci J. at paras. 28-29
    described the importance of the electoral process as “the primary means by
    which the average citizen participates in the open debate that animates the
    determination of social policy.”  He
    identified that the right to vote allows each citizen to express support for
    the ideas of a candidate or party and “full political debate ensures that ours
    is an open society with the benefit of a broad range of ideas and opinions”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Full debate cannot happen, said Iacobucci J.,
    when some voices are artificially amplified.  The absence of a level playing field means
    that ideas or opinions of some Canadians are at an evident disadvantage even as
    a matter of public expression.  He noted
    at para. 49:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Owing to
    the competitive nature of the electoral process, the capacity of one citizen to
    participate in the electoral process is closely connected to the capacity of
    other citizens to participate in the electoral process.  The reason for this is that there is only so
    much space for political discourse; if one person “yells” or occupies a
    disproportionate amount of space in the marketplace for ideas, it becomes
    increasingly difficult for other persons to participate in that discourse.  It is possible, in other <span class=GramE>words,
    that</span> the voices of certain citizens will be drowned out by the voices of
    those with a greater capacity to communicate their ideas and opinions to the general
    public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Specifically relevant for the purposes of this
    analysis is Iacobucci J.’s emphasis on the importance of promoting equality in
    the political discourse through election financing.  At para. 72 he explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The systems
    and regulations that govern the process by which governments are formed should
    not be easily compromised.  Electoral
    financing is an integral component of that process, and thus it is of great
    importance that the integrity of the electoral financing regime be preserved.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The importance of promoting equality in the
    political forum through election financing was both reinforced and amplified by
    the Supreme Court in <i>Harper</i>.  The action was commenced by Mr. Harper to
    challenge the new third party spending limits and related provisions in the <i>Elections Act </i>under ss. 2(b), 2(d) and 3
    of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At its core, <i>Harper</i> involved the freedom of third parties to freely express their political views
    and the limits that Parliament may put on this expression in the interests of a
    fair political discourse – in other words, the interaction between competing <i>Charter</i> interests.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In its analysis, the Supreme Court noted that
    the overarching objective of election spending limits was electoral fairness,
    achieved in that case by limiting the election advertising of third parties who
    are influential participants in the electoral discourse.  While the limits on third party spending were
    found to violate s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    they were justified under s. 1.  The
    Supreme Court noted at para. 72 that in the absence of spending limits, it
    would be possible for the affluent or a number of people pooling their
    resources to dominate the political discourse and deprive their opponents of a
    reasonable opportunity to be heard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Supreme Court explained that while a level
    playing field could be achieved in two ways – namely, by ensuring resources are
    equally accessible to <span class=GramE>all,</span> or by placing limits on the
    ability to spend – Parliament had chosen to rely on the latter.  At para. 62, Bastarache J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court’s
    conception of electoral fairness ... is consistent with the egalitarian model
    of elections adopted by Parliament as an essential component of our democratic
    society.  This model is premised on the
    notion that individuals should have an equal opportunity to participate in the
    electoral process.  Under this model,
    wealth is the main obstacle to equal participation....  Thus, the egalitarian model promotes an
    electoral process that requires the wealthy to be prevented from controlling
    the electoral process to the detriment of others with less economic power.  The state can equalize participation in the
    electoral process in two ways....  First,
    the State can provide a voice to those who might otherwise not be heard.  The Act does so by reimbursing candidates and
    political parties and by providing broadcast time to political parties.  <i>Second,
    the State can restrict the voices which dominate the political discourse so
    that others may be heard as well.  In
    Canada, electoral regulation has focussed on the latter by regulating electoral
    spending through comprehensive election finance provisions.</i>  <i>These
    provisions seek to create a level playing field for those who wish to engage in
    the electoral discourse.</i>  This, in
    turn, enables voters to be better informed; no one voice is overwhelmed by
    another. [Emphasis added and citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This conclusion regarding the importance and
    effectiveness of spending limits in promoting a level political playing field
    was also arrived at in the report of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform
    and Party Financing, <i>Reforming Electoral
    Democracy</i>, vol. 1 (Ottawa:  Communication Group, 1991), which states at p. 336:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[S]pending
    limits during election campaigns constitute a significant instrument for
    promoting fairness in the electoral process.  They reduce the potential advantage of those with access to significant
    financial resources and thus help foster a reasonable balance in debate during
    elections.  They also encourage access to
    the election process.  This adds meaning
    to the fundamental right of candidacy by enhancing the opportunity for a more
    representative House of Commons.  Finally, spending limits (as designed in our electoral law) help achieve
    these democratic objectives without diminishing electoral competition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the purposes of the analysis in this case,
    what can be gleaned from <i>Figueroa</i>,
    and in particular <i>Harper</i>, is not only
    Parliament’s adoption of the egalitarian model of elections, but also that
    spending limits are the primary instrument used to promote this objective.</p>

    the Party to retain its GST rebate under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> and the refund from the government under the <i>Elections Act</i>, even though there is some
    overlap in these rebates.  In particular,
    the Party was reimbursed under the <i>Elections
    Act</i> for a percentage of the GST incurred on its expenses for the 2004 and
    2006 elections.  The Party was
    subsequently rebated 50% of this same GST under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As previously mentioned, the Fund’s position has
    the effect of increasing the amount the Party can spend on general elections
    before reaching the cap.  If GST rebates
    received under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> are
    deducted from reportable expenses on general election expenses returns under
    the <i>Elections Act</i>, this deduction
    would reduce the total reported expenses and free up space under the Party’s
    spending cap for further expenditures.  This
    would effectively increase the Party’s spending limit on general elections not
    only for these two elections but for any future general elections for which it
    had QNPO status.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Each side relies on what it submits are the
    negative policy implications of the other’s position to support its argument
    that the drafters of the legislation, deemed to be aware of the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> and the consequences of
    its intersection with the <i>Elections Act</i>,
    could not have intended such a result.  I
    refer to the principle of statutory interpretation that it is presumed that the
    entire body of legislation enacted by a legislature does not contain
    contradictions or inconsistencies, but rather that the provisions are meant to
    work together to form a rational, coherent whole:  <i>Sullivan
    on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5th ed., at p. 325.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The problem here is that no matter which of the
    two interpretations is accepted, Parliament’s intent to maintain a level
    political playing field is affected by the Party’s having the benefit of either
    increased funds available to it or an increased spending limit.  However, as I have previously indicated, while
    an increase in the amount of money in the bank is helpful to a political
    party’s ability to communicate its message and views to the public, in terms of
    the promotion of a level political playing field, an increase in the party’s
    ability to spend during an election campaign is substantially more
    significant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The important role that spending limits play in
    the promotion of Canada’s electoral equilibrium leads to two interconnected
    conclusions that demonstrate that the application judge’s interpretation of the
    Act’s reporting requirements in terms of general election expenses is in
    error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    I disagree with the application judge’s conclusion at para. 75 that the
    provisions in the <i>Elections Act</i> that
    provide for different levels of government subsidy for political parties with
    differing levels of electoral support provide evidence that the <i>Elections Act</i> “does not always give supremacy
    to the policy of a ‘level playing field’ among political parties.”  These provisions do not indicate Parliament’s
    acceptance of an uneven political playing field.  Parliament’s objective of promoting the
    egalitarian model of elections is made obvious through the spending limitations
    imposed during general elections.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    interpreting the <i>Elections Act</i> in
    accordance with the CEO’s position – that election expenses are not to be
    reported in accordance with GAAP – is the interpretation that is harmonious
    with the scheme and the object of the Act and with Parliament’s intention.</p>
  <h3>Other issues relied upon by the application judge as contradicting
    Parliament’s intent</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the application judge held that the CEO’s position creates a number of practical
    consequences that must be taken as contradicting Parliament’s intention that
    election expenses be reported in accordance with GAAP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    principle of statutory interpretation that is engaged in this part of the
    analysis is set out, once again, in <i>Re
    Rizzo</i>, where Iacobucci J. wrote at para. 27 that “[i]t is a well
    established principle of statutory interpretation that the legislature does not
    intend to produce absurd consequences.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.</i>,
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, Gonthier J. expressed the principle as follows at para.
    65:  “Since it may be presumed that the
    legislature does not intend unjust or inequitable results to flow from its
    enactments, judicial interpretations should be adopted which avoid such
    results.”    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am not persuaded that the CEO’s position produces “absurd consequences” or
    “unjust or inequitable results”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Fund contends that the resultant different reporting requirements for annual
    financial transactions returns and general election expenses returns would unduly
    affect the maintenance of a political party’s books and the complexity of the
    required audits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  There was no evidence before
    the application judge of any actual problems that would be experienced by <span
class=GramE>parties’ being</span> required, in their financial reporting, to
    adjust for GAAP treatment, where appropriate.  Further, while it is true that the auditor will have to present reports
    for audits of financial transactions returns and election expenses returns using
    different accounting principles, this is a standard requirement when an
    organization must, by statute or otherwise, report its financial information
    under different principles for different purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Fund also argued that the CEO’s interpretation would create a lacuna within the
    operation of the <i>Elections Act</i> in the
    sense that the auditors would be left with no standard by which to report on
    general election expenses returns.  The
    simple answer to this concern is that the legislation itself contains the
    reporting standard.  Section 430(1) of
    the Act requires general election expenses to be reported in a manner that
    “presents fairly the information contained in the financial records on which
    the return is based.”  There is no
    evidence that this stated manner of reporting is in any way problematic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    as previously indicated, I disagree with the application judge’s finding that
    there was no meaningful policy distinction in the <i>Excise Tax Act</i> between the ITC regime and the GST rebate provisions
    in respect of QNPOs that would justify treating GST rebates differently than
    ITCs.  The ITC regime provides for
    reimbursement of the GST paid on purchases of goods and services used in the
    course of doing business.  In contrast,
    the s. 259 rebate under the <i>Excise Tax
    Act</i> is a subsidy provided to a particular group of organizations that
    receive a substantial amount of their funding from the government.  It is given in recognition of their public
    service performance.<a href="#_ftn2"

'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The
    two serve different purposes to advance different policies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, the practical problems the application judge identified as supporting
    his interpretation of the legislation over that proposed by the CEO are not, in
    my view, problems at all.  Certainly,
    they do not undermine my conclusion that Parliament intended that a political
    party’s election expenses are not to be reported in accordance with GAAP.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the interpretation I have arrived at does result in the Party’s being able to
    keep the GST rebate under the <i>Excise Tax
    Act</i> and the reimbursement under the <i>Elections
    Act</i>, that result does little if any disservice to the legislative intent of
    the <i>Elections Act</i>.  I say this because this interpretation maintains
    the equality of spending limits - the primary instrument used by Parliament to
    protect the level political playing field.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    therefore conclude that the relevant provisions of the <i>Elections Act</i> do not require that general election expenses be
    reported in accordance with GAAP.  This
    conclusion is in keeping with the clear wording of the Act.  Moreover, it is in keeping with the
    egalitarian model of elections adopted by Parliament as an essential component
    of our democratic society.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows that for the purposes of general election expenses returns, expenses do
    not have to be reported net of GST rebates.  The Fund’s returns for the 2004 and the 2006 general elections require
    no correction. </p>
