  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal challenges the trial judge’s interpretation
    of the 2007 documents that delineated the parameters of the relationship
    between the trade association, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) and the
    appellant, Fraser Beach, one of TREB’s approximately 25,600 member brokers.  After a seven-day trial of the issues, the
    trial judge dismissed the appellant’s claims.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the broker of record for BNV Real
    Estate Inc. (BNV).  He had a password provided
    by TREB to access its database.  Using the
    appellant’s password, BNV uploaded and made available to the public the
    contents of TREB’s Multiple Listing Service residential resale database (MLS Database
    or Database) of its listings in Toronto’s centre core.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TREB responded to BNV’s action by cutting off its
    access to TREB’s MLS Database on the basis that BNV and the appellant breached
    the terms of their contractual agreements with TREB.  Without access, the appellant was no longer
    able to continue the website in its intended format and was not able to carry
    on business as a real estate broker.  BNV
    eventually relinquished its brokerage and is not a party to this proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed the documentary parameters of
    the relationship between the appellant and TREB.  He concluded that the appellant had breached
    the Authorized User Agreement (AUA) that he had signed with TREB. He also
    concluded that, in the circumstances, TREB was entitled to suspend the
    appellant’s access to its MLS Database without giving prior notice.  The appellant appeals seeking declaratory
    relief, including a declaration reinstating his TREB membership and data
    access. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In detailed and comprehensive reasons, the trial judge
    explained that TREB collected, formatted and electronically stored the listing
    information provided by its members in its MLS Database.  The purpose of the Database was to pool all information
    and to allow all members access to each other’s listings.  Members obtained access by using
    TREB-supplied passwords and TREB-designed software.  TREB also supplied a feature so that members
    could download information from the Database to their own computers and use
    their own software to refine their search in a particular manner.  A member could also use a feature called
    Property Match, which permitted a member to initiate a specific inquiry and to
    request that an e-mail be sent to the prospective client with the search
    results, as well as any updated results. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Toronto Real Estate Board permitted limited public
    access to its information in one way. Under an agreement it had as a member of
    the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), TREB uploaded and updated certain
    listings, which CREA made available to the public through its website.  TREB controlled the data it provided to CREA
    and that data did not contain all the information available to TREB’s member
    brokers on its website.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge explained, BNV was conceived by Bell
    New Ventures to use its “expertise in technology to provide residential real
    estate brokerage services to buyers and sellers of homes at rates substantially
    lower than those charged by other agents.” BNV and the appellant predicted that
    their website would be extremely popular and could be expanded across Canada to
    “generate a cumulative net cash flow of $331 million over the first five years
    of its business plan and, once operational, would create a business with a net
    present value of $1.4 billion.” BNV intended to develop a business as a
    discount brokerage based on access to the content of TREB’s database through
    the application of BNV’s software.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the view of BNV and the appellant, the proposed
    venture did not conflict with the appellant’s agreement with TREB.  The trial judge did not accept that
    view.  Instead, based on factual findings
    and his interpretation of the documents, the trial judge concluded that “the
    way in which BNV operated its website … breached sections 2, 7(a), (c<span
class=GramE>)(</span>ii) and (d) of the AUA.”  Central to his conclusion, the trial judge observed that, while members
    of the public could receive listing information, they could only do so “through
    the intermediary of a TREB member real estate agent.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected TREB’s argument that the
    appellant also breached TREB’s Acceptable Use Policy on the basis that TREB had
    failed to prove that the Policy was in force at the relevant time.  The trial judge also declined to make a
    finding that the appellant breached TREB’s Rules or its <i>Code of Ethics</i>.  However, he
    found that BNV further contravened s. 7(c) of the AUA because its website was a
    “derivative work.<b>”</b>  Finally, the trial judge concluded that TREB
    was justified in the circumstances, and on the basis of Policy 508, in
    suspending and continuing the suspension of the appellant’s access to the
    Database.  In his opinion, TREB’s
    delay/refusal to reinstate the membership of the appellant’s former brokerage could
    be properly resolved if the appellant invoked the hearing provisions set out in
    TREB’s By-law.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE AUTHORIZED USER AGREEMENT </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute about the relevant provisions of
    the AUA. The trial judge reviewed them in the following terms, parts of which I
    have italicized for emphasis:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>E.1    Definitions</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_69">[69] </a>For the
    purposes of this proceeding the key definitions in the AUA are those for the
    terms “Services”, “MLS Database”, and “Content”. The AUA defined “Services” to
    mean:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>TREB’s proprietary Internet-based system and
    associated technology that provides web-enabled display, search, retrieval, and
    uploading capabilities through the TREB website to its MLS Database and BRS Database
    and other related capabilities, including, without limitation, customer
    information services.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The term “MLS
    Database” meant:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>the aggregation of all Content as well as
    its or their selection, assembly, and arrangement, that from time to time,
    comprises the Internet-based service currently known as the multiple listing
    service (MLS), and any successor or replacement service thereto owned and
    operated by or on behalf of TREB.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>“Content” was defined to mean “all
    information</i>, comments,
    opinions, statements, advice, descriptions, services, offers, <i>data</i>, files, links, ideas, software,
    images, graphics, audio clips, video clips, icons, <i>or any other form of content or information</i>.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>E.2      The general structure of the AUA</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_70">[70] </a>… Section 2 of
    the AUA [entitled LICENSE GRANT] then <i>described
    the licence TREB granted an Authorized User in respect of the MLS Database and
    Services:</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, TREB
    grants authorized user </i>a
    non-exclusive, non-transferable <i>license,
    without right to sublicense, to access and use the </i>Services, MLS <i>Database</i> and BRS Database <i>in accordance with this Agreement</i> and in
    compliance with all applicable TREB requirements (“License”) <i>solely for the purpose of and directly
    related to the Authorized User’s ordinary carrying on of its business</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The AUA
    defined TREB Requirements to mean TREB’s MLS Policies, MLS Rules, By-Laws, and
    Standards relating to the technology needed to access the MLS Database.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_71">[71] </a>TREB’s grant of
    license was followed immediately by this acknowledgment in <i>Section 2 </i>by the authorized user:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>Authorized User unconditionally agrees to
    access and use the </i>Services,
    MLS <i>Database </i>and BRS Database <i>only in the manner and for the purposes
    expressly specified in this Agreement and</i> <i><u>for the exclusive and
    internal use by Authorized User</u></i> and by other Authorized Users that have
    a valid Authorized User Agreement in effect with TREB which has not been
    terminated or suspended. (<span class=GramE>additional</span> emphasis
    contained in the original)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_72">[72] </a><i>Section 3(b) of the AUA stated that </i>under the licence an <i>authorized user could “make Copies</i> solely for the purpose of
    Business”, <i>with “Copies” defined as “hard
    copy print outs and electronic versions </i>of the reports, results, and other
    information or materials <i>generated from </i>Authorized
    User’s access and use of the Services and MLS <i>Database</i>.” Business was defined as the business of trading in real
    estate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_73">[73] </a><i>Section 4</i> of the AUA <i>placed certain
    restrictions on the use of the MLS Database</i>. The restrictions at issue in
    this case are the following:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>4. <u>RESTRICTIONS ON USE</u></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>Authorized User acknowledges
    that the MLS Database </i>and
    BRS Database<i> as formatted by TREB have

    ownership </i>of all rights, title and interest to the Services, the Software,
    the MLS Database and the BRS Database<i>.
    Except as expressly authorized in this Agreement, Authorized User shall not:</i> (additional emphasis contained in the
    original)<i></i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)&nbsp; <span class=GramE>use</span> either the MLS Database, the BRS Database or the

    amended ...</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)&nbsp; <i>circulate or copy </i>either <i>the </i>MLS <i>Database</i>, the BRS Database or the Services in any manner <i>except to authorized users</i> who have a

    which agreement has not been terminated or is suspended, <i>and except to persons</i> <i>or
    entities who desire or may desire to acquire or dispose of certain of their
    rights respecting real estate</i>;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d)&nbsp; <i>use, </i>copy, reproduce or exploit

    any MLS Database </i>or BRS Database <i>which
    is competitive with the MLS Database</i> or the BRS Database or which is
    contrary to the By-Laws, the MLS Rules and MLS Policies, or the Real Estate and
    Business Brokers Act, R.S.O. 1990, as amended under the Real Estate and
    Business Brokers Act, 2002 when proclaimed in force, and as may be further
    amended from time to time.</p>

    Authorized User from a third party who has a legal right to disclose it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="PNUM_74">[74] </a>Section 7 then
    dealt with issues of Intellectual Property. The provisions at issue in this
    proceeding were the following:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>7. <u>Intellectual Property</u></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)&nbsp; The Services, MLS Database, BRS <i>Database</i>, Software and Documentation <i>are proprietary and confidential to TREB</i>,
    are protected by the Intellectual Property laws of Canada and international
    treaties and conventions, and shall remain the sole property of TREB.
    Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, TREB shall have
    sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title and interest in and to the
    Services and MLS Database, BRS Database, Software and Documentation including
    all derivative works and all modifications and enhancements thereof and
    derivative works, regardless of the form or media in or on which the original
    and other copies may exist. No provision or clause in this Agreement shall be
    interpreted as an assignment or grant to Authorized User of any right, title,
    or interest in or to Intellectual Property, all privileges pertaining thereto
    remaining the exclusive property of TREB (or in some cases, of its
    subcontractors).</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
    determining that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.     the appellant breached the relevant agreements with TREB;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.   TREB was
    not obliged to provide notice of default and later to restore the appellant’s
    access to the Database; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> 3.   <span class=GramE>the</span> BNV website was
    a “derivative work” in breach of section 7 of the AUA.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Breach of the AUA</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much of the argument surrounding the breach of the AUA
    centred on the acknowledged right of TREB members to copy the contents of the MLS
    Database onto their websites.  Appellant’s
    counsel argued forcefully that, given that right, the appellant’s copying of
    the Database was contractually permissible and was consistent with similar
    websites and other activities of other TREB brokers.  In particular, the appellant argued that the
    BNV website provided the public user with the same information that was already
    available from other TREB brokers, albeit by using different methodologies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the appellant’s evidence
    thoroughly. He made detailed findings of fact.  He concluded that there was a fundamentally
    different feature to the appellant’s website: it provided the public with
    direct access to TREB’s data “with the ability to search directly listing
    information that reposed in the MLS Database” without the intervention of a member
    broker.  This direct public access without
    the intervention of a member was contrary to the practice of a broker or an
    agent standing “as a buffer between the consumer and the listing information
    data stored in the MLS Database.”<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that by providing the public
    with direct access to TREB’s Database, among other provisions, BNV and the
    appellant “breached section 2 of the AUA requiring an authorized user to access
    and use … the MLS Database for its ‘exclusive and internal use’.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that this conclusion represents factual
    findings, including the scope of activities of member brokers in distributing
    data, I am not persuaded the trial judge made any reviewable error.  The factual findings, and inferences from
    those findings, were available to him on the evidence.  To the extent that the trial judge’s
    conclusion reflects the pure interpretation of a contract, he applied the
    correct principles of contract interpretation.  He approached the task by reading the plain
    language of the provisions in the context of the contract as a whole and by
    placing the contract in its appropriate setting.  He made no error of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge recognized that a reading of the AUA as
    a whole demonstrates that its primary intention was to protect its proprietary
    interest in the MLS Database for the benefit of its member brokers.  This is apparent from its specification that the
    MLS Database was “owned and operated” and was the “sole property” of and “proprietary
    and confidential” to TREB.  The AUA
    further describes the Database as having “substantial monetary value” and
    “special value due to access only by TREB members and users authorized by TREB.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2, entitled LICENSE GRANT, authorizes access
    and use of the Database, but solely for the purpose of the broker’s “ordinary carrying
    on of its business”<i>. </i>  The broker unconditionally agrees to use the
    Database only “for the purposes expressly specified in this Agreement “<i>and</i>” for the exclusive and internal use”
    by the broker [emphasis added].  In my
    view, and in light of the agreement’s predominant purpose of protecting TREB’s
    interest in the Database, the <i>and</i> in
    section 2 must be read conjunctively so that one specified purpose does not
    negative the other.  In other words, the member
    is only permitted to use the Database for its business as specified in the
    agreement and only for the member’s exclusive and internal use.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusion is clear that, in making
    the Database available to the public for direct search, “BNV breached section 2
    of the AUA because it did not confine its access and use of the Services and
    MLS Database to its exclusive and internal use.  It accessed and used the Services and MLS
    Database for external use by members of the public.” This interpretation, in my
    view, is unassailable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered and rejected the appellant’s
    argument to the contrary based on TREB’s Property Match search feature.  That feature, which was totally controlled by
    TREB, did not permit public access to all the information in TREB’s Database.  Further, a Property Match search could only be
    initiated by a member broker and then was only responsive to a specific
    inquiry.  The customer was not given
    direct access to the contents of TREB’s Database.  As the trial judge concluded, the search
    feature was no more than a “technological surrogate” for the member.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s interpretation of the AUA also makes
    commercial sense.  Only TREB and its
    members had access to the full panoply of the information contained in the
    Database because it was this very access that provided members with the primary
    tool to develop relationships with potential buyers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since I agree with the trial judge that the appellant
    was in breach of section 2, it is unnecessary to consider the restrictions
    placed on that use under section 4.  They
    simply do not apply.  However, I also
    agree with the trial judge that the appellant’s proposed interpretation of s.
    4(c) must fail.  The appellant argues
    that the exception to the exception in s. 4(c) should be interpreted as permitting
    a member the right to provide potential customers with access to the entirety
    of TREB’s database for search purposes.  In
    my view, this interpretation conflicts with, and would render nugatory, the
    whole purpose of protecting TREB’s proprietary ownership interest in the “special
    value” of the Database. As the trial judge observed, the AUA must be read “as a
    whole, in a commercially reasonable way.”  He concluded that “[t]o interpret the language of section 4(c) as
    permitting a member to copy the MLS Database for the purpose of public search
    would run completely counter to the main thrust of the AUA.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the appellant’s argument cannot survive
    scrutiny based on the structure of the AUA. Section 2 limits TREB’s grant of
    licence to “exclusive and internal use” by the broker.  Section 4 places restrictions on the use
    granted under section 2. Considered in that light, the restrictions in section
    4 cannot be interpreted to expand the licence granted under section 2.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s interpretation is further supported
    by s. 4(d), which provides that the restrictions on use do not apply to that
    part of the Database that is publicly available.  If the restrictions do not apply to the
    publicly available contents of the Database, they must apply to the Database
    that is not publicly available.  This, in
    turn means there must be a Database that is not publicly available.  No other interpretation makes sense in the
    context of this agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, counsel argued that the meaning of the 2007
    AUA would be informed by the wording of the 1998 AUA.  I do not accept this argument.  Given the plain wording of the 2007 AUA, it is
    unnecessary to consider an earlier version.  In any event, the 1998 AUA was structured differently.
     In 1998, the reference limiting the
    members’ right to copy “to the extent only that the copy directly relates to
    such acquisition or disposition” was contained in the licence provision and not
    in the restrictions on that licence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I do not accept this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         Notice of Default and Reinstatement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acknowledged the serious effect of
    TREB’s denial of access to the appellant to its Database without notice. Such a
    denial is particularly troublesome where it means the affected person will lose
    his or her livelihood without notice and without an opportunity to cure its
    default.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge concluded that TREB was
    entitled to take this action on the basis of the MLS Policy 508, by which the
    appellant was bound.  Policy 508 provides
    that “TREB in its sole <span class=GramE>discretion,</span> may terminate or
    suspend a Member’s user name and Password code in event of any unauthorized or
    improper use of the MLS Online system.”  As the trial judge concluded, the appellant’s use of the Database was
    unauthorized.  I observe that at the
    time, the appellant did not choose to pursue any remedy for immediate
    reinstatement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, there was little practical point in
    reinstating access when the entire purpose of BNV’s website and software was to
    provide public access to the Database; BNV’s position at the time was that its
    website complied with TREB’s rules; and the appellant acknowledged in
    cross-examination that “there was no other way that we could have done it”.  I am not persuaded that the trial judge made an
    error, let alone a palpable and overriding one, in arriving at the factual
    finding that reinstatement served no purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also seeks declaratory relief requesting
    reinstatement of his TREB membership, which he since allowed to lapse, as well
    as his Database access. As the trial judge pointed out, the TREB By-law
    provides for internal hearing procedures to resolve disputes. The outstanding dispute
    apparently focuses on TREB’s demand for compensation for costs arising out of
    the BNV website.  In light of the
    available internal procedure at TREB, the trial judge was entitled to exercise
    his discretion to decline the appellant’s claim for declaratory relief.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.         “Derivative Work”</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of my conclusion regarding the plain breach of
    section 2 of the AUA, it is unnecessary to consider the alternative argument
    regarding whether the BNV website constituted a “derivative work” under section
    7.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>RESULT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.  I would award costs to the respondent fixed
    in the amount of $23,500, inclusive of disbursements and all applicable taxes.</p>
