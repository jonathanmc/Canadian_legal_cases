    appeal arises out of a dispute between the appellants and the respondents over real
    estate commissions generated by the sale of two properties.   The respondents, Forest Hill Real Estate
    Inc. and one of its agents, Linda Reitapple, claim that they are entitled to
    share in the commissions earned by the appellants, Harvey Kalles Real Estate
    Limited and one of its agents, Carol Anne Warrington. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    early 2006, the owner of 8 Cluny Avenue, in the City of Toronto, decided to
    sell his home.  He retained the parties as
    co-listing agents.  </span></p>

    this end, the parties signed two agreements. The first agreement provided that
    the listing portion of the commission for the sale of the Cluny property would
    be shared on a 70/30 basis (with the respondents being entitled to 70% and the
    appellants to 30%).  The second agreement
    set out terms regarding advertising expenses and other commission issues.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    particular clause in dispute is found in the second agreement.  It provides that “[a]ny clients from open
    houses will be shared”.  This clause is
    followed by two clauses relevant to this analysis:  “[a]ny clients of Linda’s are hers (previous
    clients or new clients from personal advertising)”; and, “[a]ny clients of
    Carol Anne’s are hers”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    Rosetta Raso, a woman not previously known to either Reitapple or Warrington,
    came to an open house they had organized for the Cluny property and met both
    women.  Raso was not interested in purchasing
    the Cluny home, but she formed a relationship with Warrington as a result of
    which she ultimately purchased two properties in the Yorkville area of Toronto.  These transactions generated a total of approximately
    $325,000 in commissions – the ones in issue on this appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    relation to the first property that Raso purchased, Warrington offered
    Reitapple a $30,000 “gratuity” upon closing, while taking the position that under
    the second agreement, she believed she had no responsibility to do so.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    learning of the first Raso transaction, the respondents brought this action for
    a declaration that they were entitled to a share of the appellants’ commissions
    from all clients introduced to them at a Cluny property open house and an
    accounting of all such commissions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span

    trial judge granted judgment in favour of the respondents, declaring that they
    were entitled to half the commissions earned on the sale of properties to Raso.  She found the disputed clause in the second agreement
    to be unambiguous in the context of the commercial arrangement between the
    parties.  In her view, its clear wording
    provides that the parties are to share any commissions earned by either agent through
    a real estate transaction, other than the sale of the Cluny property, arising as
    a result of the introduction of a previously-unknown client through an open
    house for the Cluny property.  In the
    alternative, if there is any ambiguity in the clause at issue that would
    justify looking to extrinsic evidence, the trial judge held that she preferred
    Reitapple’s evidence that supported this conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>On
    appeal, the appellants challenge this conclusion, arguing that the disputed
    clause creates no contractual obligation as it is vague and equivocal.  The appellants offer no explanation as to
    what the parties may have intended by this clause.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    law is clear that when interpreting the provisions of a contract, the court
    first looks at the language used to express the intention of the parties.  If the language is not ambiguous, then the interpretive
    process ends there.  No extrinsic
    evidence is admissible to interpret clear terms in a contract.  That is not to suggest that meaning is
    attached to each word in isolation from the rest of the contract.  Context can be used to assist in revealing
    the meaning of the words.  This context
    may come from other parts of the agreement.  It may also come from the relationship created by the agreement:  see <i>Glimmer
    Resources Inc. V. Exall Resources Ltd.</i> (1999), 119 O.A.C. 78, at para. 17.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Like
    the trial judge, we find no ambiguity in the language of the disputed clause.  It plainly requires that the agents share any
    clients introduced to them through a Cluny property open house.  Implicitly, this sharing of clients
    contemplates a sharing of commissions from such clients.  In the context of the agreement as a whole,
    all possible scenarios are covered.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    agreements between the parties provide that if the Cluny property is sold to a
    contact of either of the two agents, the listing commission is split 70/30 and
    the selling commission belongs to the agent with the contact.  If the Cluny property is sold to a person
    previously unconnected to either agent, there are two possibilities.  If the stranger is represented by another
    agent, that agent may be entitled to a portion of the commission and, what
    remains, is divided by the parties on a 70/30 basis.  If the stranger is not represented by a real
    estate agent, the entire commission is split between the parties 70/30.  This deals exhaustively with the sale of the
    Cluny property. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The
    disputed clause covers another situation – the circumstance where someone is
    introduced to the agents through a Cluny property open house and later uses the
    assistance of one or both of the agents to lease, sell or purchase another
    property.  In such a case, any commission
    earned by either is shared.  Shared is
    normally understood to mean 50/50.  The
    fact that there is no time limit to the agreement does not detract from its
    clarity or its commercial effectiveness given that the court, in contract
    interpretation, often implies a reasonable time period for a contract to be in
    force.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In
    the light of our conclusion that the language of the relevant provision,
    considered in the context of the second agreement as a whole and the relationship
    between the parties reveals an unambiguous meaning, there is no need to look to
    extrinsic evidence or expert opinion in order to interpret the agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondents are entitled to their costs of this appeal fixed, as
    agreed by the parties, in the amount of $7,500, including disbursements and
    applicable taxes.   If the parties are
    unable to agree on a resolution of the trial costs, this Panel may be spoken
    to, by contacting the Registrar of this court.  </span></p>
