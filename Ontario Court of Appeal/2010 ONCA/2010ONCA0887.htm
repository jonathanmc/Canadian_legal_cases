    recent appeals in which this court must decide whether to set aside a

    defendants <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> <span class=SpellE>Koyanagi</span> Architects and <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> Construction for design and
    construction defects in the building of the <span class=SpellE>Chedoke</span> Twin
    Pad Arena.  <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> was the architect and <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> was the general
    contractor on the project.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The arena was substantially
    completed in March 1994.  The City
    alleges that serious defects, particularly cracks in the ice pad, first
    appeared soon after the arena opened.  Nonetheless, the City waited until the spring of 2000, close to the
    expiry of the limitation period,<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> to start this action.  From then on,
    except for asking for statements of defence (which were delivered) and a failed
    motion to add Honeywell as a defendant, the City did almost nothing to move the
    action along. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Eventually the registrar issued
    a status notice.  The City scheduled a
    status hearing for February 2009, but its counsel, who was handling the file,
    forgot to attend.  On July 9, 2009 the
    registrar issued an order dismissing the City’s action for delay.  On March 30, 2010 the City’s motion to set
    aside the registrar’s order was dismissed by <span class=SpellE>Lococo</span> J., principally because he found that the cumulative delay had not been
    adequately explained and had prejudiced the defendants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The City appeals the motion
    judge’s order.  The main issue on the
    appeal is whether the motion judge exercised his discretion unreasonably in
    refusing to set aside the dismissal order.  The City submits that the motion judge’s order is unreasonable on two
    bases:  first, the motion judge erred in
    finding that the City had not provided a reasonable explanation for the delay;
    and second, the motion judge erred in finding that the defendants had been
    prejudiced by the delay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The secondary issue on the
    appeal is whether the motion judge erred in awarding costs of the motion to
    Group Eight Engineering, which was third partied by <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span>.  The City submits that Group Eight had no
    standing on the motion and no entitlement to costs because it chose not to
    defend the main action.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the main issue, I do not
    agree with all of the motion judge’s analysis.  But his conclusion that the City has not made out a case for setting
    aside the registrar’s order is a reasonable conclusion.  On the secondary issue, awarding costs of the
    motion to Group Eight was a reasonable exercise of the motion judge’s
    discretion.  I would therefore dismiss
    the City’s appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        Brief
    Chronology</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The period between the time
    construction defects first appeared (late 1994) and the registrar’s dismissal
    order (July 2009) is approximately 15 years.  That 15-year period breaks down into three distinct segments:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Late 1994 (when defects appeared) to March 2000
    (when the City started the action)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>March 2000 to November 2005 (when the City asked
    for statements of defence)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>November 2005 to July 2009 (date of the
    dismissal order)</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)        Late 1994 to March 2000</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its factum, the City says
    that “serious construction defects, including cracks in the ice slabs and water
    entry problems, appeared after the arena opened”.  The motion judge found that the defects came
    to light by late 1994.  Still, the City
    did nothing for several years.  In early
    January 1999 it obtained three expert reports supporting its claim that “the
    likely causes of defects were the faulty design, faulty materials and faulty
    inspections provided by the defendants.”  It forwarded those reports to <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> but not to <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span>.  In
    March 2000 the City issued a notice of action, and in April 2000 it delivered
    its statement of claim.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      March 2000 to November 2005</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this critical
    five-and-a-half year period, the City took no steps to move its lawsuit
    forward.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defendants, on the other
    hand, were not silent during this period.  <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> asked for an indulgence to investigate
    the claim and prepare a <span class=SpellE>defence</span>.  <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> sent a
    request to inspect documents and a demand for particulars.  The City did not respond.  Then, between May 2000 and May 2001, <span
class=SpellE>Bradscot’s</span> counsel sent five letters to the City about the
    action.  The City’s in-house counsel did
    not reply to any of them.  In <span
class=SpellE>Bradscot’s</span> last letter dated May 16, 2001, it said with
    some justification:  “it appears that the
    City is no longer interested in pursuing this claim.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, in late November 2005
    the City delivered to <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> the three expert
    reports it had had in its possession since the beginning of 1999.  At the same time, it asked <span
class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> and <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> to deliver
    statements of <span class=SpellE>defence</span>.  Each defendant did so:  <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> in
    December 2005 and <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> in April 2006.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     November 2005 to July 2009</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In March 2006 the City
    appointed outside counsel to handle the matter.  That firm remained counsel of record until after the motion judge’s
    order, at which time the City retained new counsel to represent it on this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In April 2006 the City
    demolished and removed the arena’s concrete ice pad.  It then retained an engineering consultant to
    examine the cracking.  The consultant
    delivered a report in December 2006 in which it concluded that the temperature
    control system manufactured and installed by Honeywell was defective.  According to the consultant, the
    malfunctioning of the control system caused the concrete to crack.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The City then moved to add
    Honeywell as a defendant in the action. However, it waited to bring the motion
    until June 2008.  The motion was heard in
    March 2009 and dismissed because the City’s delay was not explained and had
    prejudiced Honeywell.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile, by the end of
    December 2007, two years had elapsed since <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> had delivered its statement of <span class=SpellE>defence</span>.  As the City had not set the action down for
    trial within this timeframe, the registrar issued a status notice under rule 48
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The City scheduled a status
    hearing for February 12, 2008.  The City
    alone attended on February 12 and adjourned the hearing to August 19,
    2008.  On that day because its motion to
    add Honeywell was pending, the City once again adjourned the status hearing,
    this time to February 10, 2009.  It did
    not advise either <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> or <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> of this new date.  On February 10, 2009
    no one attended the status hearing.  The
    motion judge found – and his finding is not challenged on appeal – that the
    failure of the City’s counsel to attend the status hearing was
    inadvertent.  On July 9, 2009 the registrar
    issued an order dismissing the City’s action for delay.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        The Motion
    Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In exercising his discretion
    not to set aside the registrar’s order, the motion judge made several key
    findings, which I summarize as follows:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City did not have to explain its delay in
    waiting until just before the limitation period expired to start its
    action.  However, the cumulative delay,
    of which this initial delay is a component, may be relevant on the question of
    prejudice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City did not adequately explain its delay in
    the period from the spring of 2000 to November 2005.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City did not adequately explain its failure
    to investigate potential causes of damage to the concrete ice slabs before
    retaining an expert in early 2006.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City’s delay in moving to add Honeywell, in
    isolation, would not support a finding of “unjustified litigation delay”.  However, taken together with previous delays,
    “the cumulative result … constitutes delay that has not been adequately
    explained”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prejudice to the defendants can be presumed
    because “the recollection of memory of witnesses will erode over time, and

    reflected in rule 1.04(1), is that civil actions should be decided on their
    merits.  As the motion judge said at
    para. 31 of his reasons:  “the court’s

    in the various time limits mandated by our rules, and indeed, as noted by the
    motion judge, in the provision for a status notice and hearing, is that civil
    actions should be resolved within a reasonable timeframe.  In <i>Marché</i>,
    at para. 25, my colleague Sharpe J.A. wrote about the strong public interest in
    promoting the timely resolution of disputes.  Both the litigants and the public have an interest in timely
    justice.  Their confidence in the

    exhaustive.  Moreover, which
    considerations are relevant and how much weight should be assigned to each will
    vary from case to case.  The court’s
    overriding objective is to achieve a just result – a result that balances the
    interest of the parties and takes account of the public’s interest in the
    timely resolution of disputes.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge applied the
    framework outlined above.  However, the City
    contends that he erred in two important respects:  first, by finding that the City had not
    reasonably explained its delay; and second, by finding that the defendants were
    prejudiced by the delay.  Although I do
    not agree entirely with the motion judge’s analysis, his findings of
    unexplained delay and prejudice are well supported in the record.  And his overall conclusion that the
    registrar’s order should not be set aside is reasonable and should not be
    disturbed on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I accept that three considerations
    weigh in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of setting aside the registrar’s
    order.  First, if the order is allowed to
    stand, the City will be denied a decision on the merits of its claim.  Second, courts are justifiably reluctant to
    deny litigants their day in court because of their lawyer’s slip.  Here, the dismissal order was triggered by
    the inadvertent failure of the City’s counsel to attend the status hearing he
    had scheduled.  Courts often grant relief
    against these slips.  Third, the City
    moved promptly against the dismissal order after becoming aware of it.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These considerations are
    outweighed by three others, which dictate the outcome of this appeal:  the delay is inordinately long; a critical
    part of the delay was either unexplained or intentional; and the cumulative delay
    has prejudiced the defendants.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(<span
class=SpellE>i</span>)        The delay is
    inordinately long</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By any reasonable standard the
    delay in this case is inordinately long.  Fifteen years after the City claimed the ice pad was <span class=GramE>damaged,</span> its action has not proceeded past the pleadings stage.  Of course, defendants as well as plaintiffs
    have an obligation to move an action along:  see <span class=SpellE><i>Clairmonte</i></span><i> v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (1970), 12 D.L.R. (3d) 425 at 442 (Ont. C.A.).  But the primary responsibility rests with a plaintiff:  see <span class=SpellE><i>Wellwood</i></span><i> v. Ontario (Provincial
    Police)</i> (2010), 262 O.A.C. 349 (C.A.).  Moreover, this is not a case where the defendants sat back silently
    waiting for the City to falter.  For
    example, after serving the notice to inspect documents and the demand for particulars, <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> wrote five letters to the City about the
    status of this action.  Inexplicably, the
    City did not reply to any of them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On my assessment of the record,
    the entire responsibility for the delay rests with the City.  And, having waited until close to the expiry
    of the limitation period to start its action, the City was obliged to move it
    along.  Yet, seemingly it did nothing in
    the critical five-and-a-half-year period between March 2000 and November
    2005.  Its inaction during that period
    cries out for an explanation.  That leads
    to the second consideration supporting the motion judge’s decision.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(ii)
         The City’s inaction was unexplained or
    intentional</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge found that the
    City did not adequately explain its failure to proceed with its action between
    March 2000 and November 2005.  The City
    contends that this finding is tainted by two errors:  first, the motion judge erred by requiring
    the City to explain its failure in this period to investigate potential causes
    of damage to the concrete ice slabs; second, the motion judge erred by failing
    to give effect to what the City says was an understanding among all parties
    that the action would not proceed to discovery until the ice pad was removed
    and demolished.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the City that, in
    the context of this motion, it was not obliged to explain its delay in
    investigating the causes of the damage to the ice pad.  Even so, however, it was obliged to explain
    its delay in this period and it did not do so.  The “understanding” on which the City relied was rightly rejected by the
    motion judge, at para. 20 of his reasons, because there was no direct evidence
    to support it.  He said and I agree:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The only evidence of this understanding before the
    court was contained in an “information and belief” affidavit from a lawyer from
    the law firm currently representing the City, who did not represent the City at
    the relevant time.  No written evidence
    of the understanding was provided, and none of the other supposed parties to
    the alleged understanding had any recollection of it.  In these circumstances, and in the absence of
    affidavit evidence from someone from the City with direct knowledge of the
    alleged understanding (who would then have been subject to cross-examination on
    this point), the City has not discharged its onus of providing an adequate
    explanation for the delay during this period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Additionally, neither of the
    in-house counsel handling the file during this period filed an affidavit on the
    motion.  In a case where the inordinate
    length of the delay was obvious, this was a serious omission.  This omission means either that the City’s
    delay is unexplained or leads to the inference that the City has no adequate
    explanation for its delay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In oral argument before the
    motion judge, the City advanced a different position:  it decided to keep the ice pad in place until
    the end of its useful life, and proceed with its action only once the ice pad
    was removed and demolished.  In other
    words, perhaps because of financial considerations, its delay in this period
    was not unexplained but intentional.  The
    reason proffered for its intentional delay is hardly a satisfactory explanation
    for further protracting an already protracted lawsuit.  If indeed its decision to delay its action
    during this period was intentional, the City alone must bear the consequences
    of that decision.  In short, I agree with
    the motion judge that the City did not provide an adequate explanation for the
    delay during this five-and-a-half-year period.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Actual prejudice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On motions to set aside orders
    dismissing an action for delay, the question whether a defendant has been
    prejudiced by the delay is invariably a key, if not the key,
    consideration.  <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> and <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> filed affidavits stating that they had
    been prejudiced by the long delay because many of their important witnesses
    were now either unavailable or could no longer remember much about the
    project.  The motion judge relied on this
    evidence to find, at para. 28 of his reasons, that the City’s delay had
    prejudiced the defendants:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Defendants <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> and <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> have both provided instances of where
    important witnesses are unavailable or their evidence impaired by the passage
    of time caused by the City’s delay.  In
    the case of <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span>, the lead principal involved in
    this project, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Koyanagi</span>, is 80 years old and
    semi-retired, and his memory of a project completed 16 years ago has
    faded.  <span class=SpellE>Svedas’s</span> senior technical employee with day-to-day responsibility for the project is in
    poor health and unavailable to testify as a witness.  Other technical personnel involved in the
    project have long since left the firm and <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> has
    no knowledge of their whereabouts.  <span
class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> also provided evidence that key personnel involved
    in the project no longer worked for the company and could not be located or, if
    they could be located, had faded memories of the project or were unavailable to
    testify for health reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge also found
    that “the City’s failure to move in a timely manner to add Honeywell as a
    defendant” had prejudiced <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Bradscot</span>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The City submits that the
    motion judge erred in both of these findings.  It submits that no prejudice resulted from the unavailability or faded
    recollection of witnesses because this is a case where “the documentary
    evidence will tell the <span class=GramE>tale”,</span> and almost all of the
    relevant documents are still available.  The
    City also submits that its failure to add Honeywell cannot constitute prejudice
    because the defendants could have done their own investigation to decide
    whether to seek contribution from Honeywell.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To take the City’s second
    submission first, I agree with it.  The
    City could sue whom it wanted to sue.  Its failure to move in a timely way to add Honeywell put it in the same
    position as if it had decided not to sue Honeywell at all.  If the action proceeded to trial and it
    turned out that the City had not sued the right defendant or defendants, then
    its action would fail.  But nothing prevented <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span> or <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span> from adding
    Honeywell as a third party.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That leaves the motion judge’s
    finding of prejudice based on the unavailability or faded memories of important
    witnesses.  I agree with the City that
    cases may arise that turn largely or completely on documents or expert
    evidence.  In those cases, the evidence
    of key witnesses may be unimportant.  The
    City asserts that this is just such a case.  Yet it put no evidence forward to support this assertion.  Moreover, it did not cross-examine on the
    affidavit evidence filed by <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span>.  And, although the City did cross-examine on
    the affidavit filed by <span class=SpellE>Bradscot</span>, the
    cross-examination did not undermine <span class=SpellE>Bradscot’s</span> evidence that several of its important witnesses either were unavailable or had
    little recollection of the project.  Thus, the City’s attack on the motion judge’s finding of prejudice from
    unavailable witnesses and lost memories must fail.  </span></p>

    brought by <span class=SpellE>Svedas</span>, including the claim against Group
