  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge granted the respondent’s claim for a
    declaration that it had no liability to the appellant or to the other defendant
    in the action for premiums in consideration of the extension of an insurance
    program from June 1, 2004 to June 30, 2004, together with other ancillary relief.
    I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <p class=Party><b>Facts</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts are straightforward and not contested. The
    respondent, M.B. Kouri Insurance Brokers Ltd., is an insurance broker whose
    clientele consists of approximately 175 camp ground operators. The appellant, Ecclesiastical
    Insurance Office Public Limited Company, is an insurance company that provided
    insurance to Kouri’s clients. The insurance was arranged through <span
class=SpellE>Ecclesiastical’s</span> broker, R.L. <span class=SpellE>Gougeon</span> Limited, the other defendant. Kouri had a sub-broker agreement with Gougeon. Kouri
    had no direct dealings with Ecclesiastical; all arrangements were made through
    Gougeon. In fact, the agreement between Kouri and Gougeon provided that only Gougeon,
    and not Kouri, had authority to bind Ecclesiastical to an insurance contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the months before the common coverage expiry date of
    May 31, 2004, Kouri began to make inquiries through Gougeon as to whether Ecclesiastical
    would renew coverage for the camp ground program. Ecclesiastical, however,
    provided no response. Not having received any response, Kouri, on May 10, 2004,
    took the unilateral step of issuing certificates of insurance renewing the
    insurance coverage by Ecclesiastical for the period May 31, 2004 to May 31,
    2005. Kouri also sent its clients an invoice for the renewed coverage and an
    increased premium. Kouri advised neither Gougeon nor Ecclesiastical that it had
    taken this unilateral action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 17, 2004 Ecclesiastical notified Gougeon that it
    was extending the insurance program for 30 days while it continued to consider
    whether it would renew the program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few days before the end of June 2004, Kouri, not
    having received confirmation of Ecclesiastical’s renewal of the program,
    arranged coverage with another insurer, Grain Insurance and Guarantee Company,
    for a 12-month period commencing July 1, 2004. On July 7, Kouri advised Gougeon
    that it had placed all of its campground business with another insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kouri sent to Grain the monies it received on the
    invoices it had sent out for the Ecclesiastical coverage for the May 31, 2004
    to May 31, 2005 term, as payment for Grain’s insurance coverage for the July 1,
    2004 to June 31, 2005 term, less its commission of 20% on the Grain coverage. Kouri’s
    commission on the Ecclesiastical coverage was 15%.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, Ecclesiastical, through Gougeon, sought
    premium payments for the month of June, 2004. Kouri took the position that Ecclesiastical
    had provided the 30-day extension of insurance coverage on a goodwill basis. Kouri
    began an action against Ecclesiastical for a declaration that it was not liable
    to pay Ecclesiastical or Gougeon any premiums for the 30-day extension period
    and for damages. Ecclesiastical counterclaimed for payment of the premiums for
    the insurance extension during the month of June, 2004. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that when Ecclesiastical extended
    its insurance coverage for 30 days, it did not stipulate there would be a
    premium for the extension. That fact, considered in the context of all the
    circumstances, especially Ecclesiastical’s failure to deal with the renewal of
    insurance in a timely manner, led the trial judge to conclude that Ecclesiastical
    had granted the extension on a no-premium basis because of its own lack of
    diligence in deciding whether it would renew the entire insurance program.
    Therefore he granted the declaration sought by Kouri together with the
    ancillary relief.</p>
  <p class=Party><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal. The trial judge erred by
    focusing on the 30-day extension of insurance, rather than Kouri’s unilateral
    extension of Ecclesiastical’s insurance coverage for the period May 31, 2004 to
    May 31, 2005. Further, he failed to apply s. 402 of the<i> Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 (“Act”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of the proceedings following the filing
    of Kouri’s statement of claim, Kouri disclosed to Gougeon and Ecclesiastical the
    fact that it had unilaterally sent out certificates of insurance renewing the
    insurance coverage provided by Ecclesiastical for another year. Upon this
    disclosure, Ecclesiastical amended its defense and counterclaim to claim
    premiums for the month of June pursuant to the insurance renewal and not the
    insurance extension and to rely on the statutory trust provisions of the Act. I
    quote from the pleading at some length to demonstrate how clearly it set out
    the basis for Ecclesiastical’s claim:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he Plaintiff, Kouri, without
    authority, in early May 2004, issued renewal notices of the insurance coverage
    to each of the insureds in the Camp Group, for the time period May 31, 2004 to
    May 31, 2005, and sent each of the Camp Group an invoice for the premium due
    for the insurance coverage in the Renewal Notices (the “Renewal Notices”). In
    the Renewal Notices, Kouri stated that the insurer was Ecclesiastical Insurance
    Office. Kouri received payment of premiums from the Camp Group pursuant to the
    Renewal Notices, but did not pay to Gougeon or Ecclesiastical any of the
    premiums received. Ecclesiastical states that these premiums, when received by Kouri
    are impressed with a trust and that Kouri was a trustee for Ecclesiastical when
    it received the premium payments made to Kouri pursuant to the Renewal Notices.
    Kouri paid the premiums received pursuant to the Renewal Notices to the new
    insurer of the Camp Group, in breach of its trust obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ecclesiastical went on to plead and rely on s. 402 of
    the Act and to claim damages for breach of trust as well as payment for the
    premiums collected pursuant to the insurance coverage for the month of June
    2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 402 of the Act provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Agent to be deemed to hold premium in trust for insurer</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)  An agent or broker who acts in negotiating,
    or renewing or continuing a contract of insurance, other than life insurance,
    with a licensed insurer, and who receives any money or substitute for money as
    a premium for such a contract from the insured, shall be deemed to hold such
    premium in trust for the insurer, and, if the agent or broker fails to pay the
    premium over to the insurer within fifteen days after written demand made upon
    the agent or broker therefor, less the commission of the agent or broker and any
    deductions to which, by the written consent of the company, the agent or broker
    is entitled, such failure is proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
    that the agent or broker has used or applied the premium for a purpose other
    than paying it over to the insurer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Agent to be deemed to hold money in trust for payee under policy</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)  An agent or broker who acts in negotiating or renewing or continuing a
    contract of insurance with a licensed insurer, and who receives any money or
    substitute for money for payment to a person in respect of the contract of
    insurance shall be deemed to hold such money in trust for the person entitled
    thereto, and, if the agent or broker fails to pay the money over to such person
    within fifteen days after written demand made upon the agent or broker
    therefor, less the commission of the agent or broker and any deductions to
    which the agent or broker is entitled, such failure is proof, in the absence of
    evidence to the contrary, that the agent or broker has used or applied the
    money for a purpose other than paying it over to the person entitled. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To support its reliance on s. 402, Ecclesiastical asserted
    that Kouri’s unilateral act of sending out certificates of insurance on its
    behalf had created valid contracts of insurance. Kouri argued that the certificates
    it mailed out were ineffective because its contract with Gougeon provided it
    had no authority to bind Ecclesiastical. Kouri misses the point. The issue is
    not Kouri’s authority under its contract with Gougeon, but its ostensible
    authority from the point of view of the insureds. Whether Kouri breached its
    contract is a different question from whether the insureds could rely on the
    certificates of insurance. However, strictly speaking it is not necessary to
    decide the question because, on the pleadings, it was not open to Kouri to take
    the position that its renewal of Ecclesiastical’s insurance coverage was not
    effective. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its reply to Ecclesiastical’s counterclaim, Kouri “denie[d]
    that it had no authority in early May 2004 to issue renewal notices to each of
    the insureds in the camp group.” Kouri then pleaded that a failure to deliver
    renewal notices “would have left [Kouri’s] clients without any expectation of
    coverage after May 31, 2004”. Kouri even pleaded the fact that all monies it
    received “in response to the delivery of renewal notices sent out in early May
    2004 were paid over to the new carrier, Grain”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the admissions contained in Kouri’s
    pleadings are sufficient to support judgment against it. Section 402 clearly
    applies on the facts pleaded by Kouri. Even if Kouri were allowed to advance a
    position inconsistent with its pleadings, I would take the view that its
    ostensible authority <a name="_GoBack"></a>was sufficient to create binding
    contracts of insurance on behalf of Ecclesiastical. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both avenues lead to the conclusion that Kouri received
    money as premium payments for a contract of insurance with Ecclesiastical, and
    instead of holding that money in trust and paying it over to the insurer, it
    paid the money to Grain. I add the observation that s. 402 applies to an agent
    or broker who does nothing more than act “in negotiating” a contract of
    insurance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that Ecclesiastical is entitled to premiums for the insurance coverage pursuant to the renewal notices for the period that it provided coverage together with administrative costs flowing from the cancellation of that coverage. Ecclesiastical requested $57,298.00 in its Notice of Appeal and its factum. Kouri did not take issue with Ecclesiastical&rsquo;s calculation of the amount owing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no merit in Kouri’s argument, advanced at trial
    and repeated on appeal, that it “had no absolutely no choice but to deliver
    renewal notices in light of the approaching common expiry date of May 31,
    2004”. Ecclesiastical’s position throughout the months preceding the expiry
    date was that it had not yet decided whether it would renew the coverage.
    Ecclesiastical never gave Kouri any indication that it would renew the
    coverage. Ecclesiastical’s dilatoriness, while arguably irresponsible, was not
    illegal or wrongful conduct. Ecclesiastical, Gougeon and Kouri were all
    corporate entities pursuing their own commercial interests, as they were
    entitled to. Kouri was free to arrange insurance with another carrier at any
    time it considered it inadvisable to wait for a response from Ecclesiastical.
    There is no basis for its claims of interference with economic relations and
    promissory estoppel. </p>
  <p class=Party><b>Disposition</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the trial judge and replace it with a judgment dismissing Kouri&rsquo;s application for declaratory and other relief, and granting Ecclesiastical&rsquo;s counterclaim in the amount of $57,298.00 on the renewed insurance coverage and breach of the statutory trust. In addition, Ecclesiastical is entitled to pre-judgment interest at a rate of 4% per annum calculated on the principal sum of $57,298.00 from July 1, 2004 to April 12, 2010, being a further $13,249.18, for a total judgment on the counterclaim of $70,547.18. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I would fix Ecclesiastical’s
    costs of the trial at $63,000 and its costs of the appeal at $15,000, both
    amounts inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
