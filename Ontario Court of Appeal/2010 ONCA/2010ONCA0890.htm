  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>This appeal involves the interplay between the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”) and the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24
    (“<i>LA, 2002</i>”) in a fraudulent
    conveyance action brought by a creditor pursuant to a s. 38 order under the <i>BIA</i>.  The issue is whether the discoverability principle under ss. 5 and 12 of
    the <i>LA, 2002</i> is based on the
    discoverability of the Trustee or on the discoverability of the creditor who has
    obtained an order under s. 38 permitting the creditor to bring the proceedings
    in his own name. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The motion judge held that it was only the
    Trustee’s discovery of the claim that was relevant under the <i>LA, 2002.</i> Therefore, he found that the <i>LA,</i> <i>2002</i> applied to bar a fraudulent conveyance claim made more than two years after the
    Trustee first learned of the alleged fraudulent conveyances.  He opined that because the appellant was
    exercising the right of the Trustee in commencing the action under <span
class=GramE>a</span> s. 38 order, it could not acquire any higher rights in the
    cause of action than the Trustee.  Accordingly,
    he found that only the Trustee’s discovery of the claim was relevant; since the
    Trustee discovered the claim more than two years prior to bringing the action,
    the appellant’s claim was statute barred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The appellant’s position is that the effect of s.
    12(1) of the <i>LA, 2002</i> is that the
    claim was discovered on the earlier of the day the Trustee or the appellant
    first discovered the claim. The appellant first learned of the underlying
    matters at a time when the former <i>Limitations
    Act</i> was in force. Pursuant to the former limitations regime, a cause of
    action based on a fraudulent conveyance of property had no limitation
    period.  Therefore, the appellant argues
    that under the transition provisions of the <i>LA,
    2002</i>, this action is not subject to a limitation period. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The motion judge did not have the benefit of
    full written submissions on the limitations issue, as it was raised for the
    first time in the applicant’s factum shortly before the hearing.  For the reasons that follow, I would allow
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><b><u>Background
    Facts</u></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>After obtaining a judgment against David Robin
    Sloan in 2001, the appellant commenced an action (the “First Fraudulent
    Conveyance Action”) against Mr. Sloan in 2002 to reverse the conveyance of his
    matrimonial home to his wife Valerie Frances Sloan for no consideration. The appellant
    subsequently discovered that other assets had been conveyed to Ms. Sloan and to
    a corporation owned by her. Mr. Sloan filed an Assignment in Bankruptcy on
    January 13, 2004, which had the effect of staying the First Fraudulent
    Conveyance Action. The appellant brought the alleged fraudulent conveyances to
    the attention of the Trustee in Bankruptcy in 2004. The Trustee did not proceed
    with an action. In 2005, Mr. Sloan was discharged from bankruptcy.  On April 5, 2006, the First Fraudulent
    Conveyance Action was dismissed in accordance with s.&nbsp;178(2) of the <i>BIA</i>. There is no outstanding right of
    appeal with respect to that decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>On April 6, 2006, the appellant obtained an
    order under s. 38 of the <i>BIA</i>,
    permitting it to bring proceedings against the respondents that the Trustee was
    entitled to<i> </i>bring. Pursuant to its s.
    38 order, the appellant commenced the within action (the “Second Fraudulent
    Conveyance Action”) in June 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><b><u>Analysis</u></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>It is not disputed that if the Trustee’s
    discoverability date governs, this action is time barred. However, if the
    appellant’s discoverability date governs, no limitation period applies to this
    action by operation of the transition provision in s. 24(6) of the <i>LA, 2002</i>.  This section says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal;
'><a
name="P329_28538"></a><a name=s24s6></a><b><span
lang=EN>24(6)</span></b><span lang=EN> If
    there was no former limitation period and if a limitation period under this Act
    would apply were the claim based on an act or omission that took place on or
    after January 1, 2004, the following rules apply:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal;
'>1. If the claim was not discovered before
    January 1, 2004, this Act applies as if the act or omission had taken place on
    that date.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal;
'>2. If the claim was discovered before
    January 1, 2004, there is no limitation period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>A trustee’s authority to attack fraudulent
    conveyances and preferences made prior to bankruptcy arises under ss. 30(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>d), 95 and 96 of the <i>BIA</i>.  For conveyances that fall outside the
    time periods set out in the <i>BIA</i>, a
    trustee can still resort to provincial property statutes dealing with
    preferences and fraudulent transfers pursuant to s. 30(1)(d) of the <i>BIA</i>: see <i>Robinson v. Countrywide Factors Ltd</i>., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 753, at pp.
    793-94 and <i>Re Garrett</i>, 1979 CarswellOnt
    195 (S.C.), at para. 2.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Section 30(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) of the <i>BIA</i> confers power on the Trustee,
    with the permission of the inspectors, to “bring, institute or defend any
    action or other legal proceeding relating to the property of the bankrupt”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under s. 38(1) of the <i>BIA</i>, where a creditor requests the trustee to take any proceeding
    that in his opinion would be for the benefit of the estate of a bankrupt and
    the trustee refuses or neglects to take the proceeding, “the creditor may
    obtain from the court an order authorizing him to take the proceeding in his
    own name”.  Section 38(2) requires the
    trustee to “assign and transfer to the creditor all his right, title and interest
    in the chose in action or subject-matter of the proceeding, including any
    document in support thereof.” Section 38(3) provides that: “Any benefit derived
    from a proceeding taken pursuant to subsection (1), to the extent of his claim
    and the costs, belongs exclusively to the creditor instituting the proceeding,
    and the surplus, if any, belongs to the estate.” This section provides for
    enhanced recovery by the creditor because the creditor proceeding under <span
class=GramE>a</span> s.&nbsp;38 order is entitled to full satisfaction of his
    debt before the surplus is distributed to the estate. On the other hand, if the
    trustee had pursued the claim under s. 30(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>d) of the <i>BIA</i>, the creditor would share
    rateably with other creditors from any proceeds obtained by the trustee.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>It is common ground that the appellant’s right
    to raise the issues in the Second Fraudulent Conveyance Action arises through
    the s. 38 order and from the Trustee’s cause of action. As the motion judge
    observed at para. 36: “In my view, Indcondo’s right to raise the issues in the
    Second Fraudulent Conveyance Action can only come from the s. 38 order through
    which Indcondo essentially steps into the shoes of the Trustee to prosecute the
    claim.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Section 5(1)(a) of the <i>LA, 2002 </i>sets out when a claim is discovered for the purposes of
    calculating the limitation period:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A claim is discovered

class=GramE>the</span> day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and

  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The motion judge did not consider s. 12(1) of
    the <i>LA, 2002</i>. It applies for the
    purpose of determining discoverability of successors under s. 5(1)(a):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For the purpose
    of clause 5(1)(a), in the case of a proceeding commenced by a person claiming
    through a predecessor in right, title or interest, the person shall be deemed
    to have knowledge of the matters referred to in that clause on the earlier of
    the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The day the
    predecessor first knew or ought to have known of those matters. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The day the
    person claiming first knew or ought to have known of them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Section 12 is the only provision that makes
    reference to the fact that the person making the claim may be pursuing the
    claim on behalf of someone else. Section 12(2) makes similar provision for
    principals and agents.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The respondents submit that the Trustee is not a
    predecessor in right, title or interest and that the creditor may bring its
    claim by operation of law rather than by assignment. However, s. 38(2)
    explicitly refers to an assignment and transfer of the trustee’s “right, title
    and interest” to the creditor.  In <i>Shaw Estate v. Nicol Island Development Inc.</i> (2009), 248 O.A.C. 35, this court reiterated that under s. 38, the creditor
    steps into the shoes of the Trustee and is entitled to bring a proceeding that
    the Trustee refuses or neglects to bring.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>As the assignor of the cause of action, the Trustee
    is therefore “a predecessor in right, title or interest” to the person claiming
    through him. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>On a plain reading of ss. 5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    and 12(1) of the <i>LA 2002</i>, the
    relevant discoverability date is the earlier of that of the predecessor (in
    this case, the Trustee) or the person claiming through the predecessor (in this
    case, the appellant). Section 12(1) refers to the “knowledge of the matters
    referred to” in s. 5(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a). Section 5(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a)(i) – (iv) refers to knowledge of the underlying facts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The respondents suggest that such an
    interpretation could create chaos and ambiguity by importing the
    discoverability date of any creditor. However, s. 12(1) is clear that the
    discoverability contest would be between the trustee and the “person claiming”
    through the trustee.  Therefore, the
    section would only apply to those creditors who have commenced the proceedings
    through the s. 38 order. The ambiguity envisioned by the respondents does not
    exist on this interpretation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The application of s. 12(1) to a creditor
    claiming through the trustee will be to make effective the earlier
    discoverability date of either the assignor or the assignee, so that an
    assignment cannot have the effect of re-starting the running of a limitation
    period. Ordinarily, this would operate to the benefit of the defendant. If the
    creditor were aware of the underlying facts under s. 5(1)(a) of the <i>LA, 2002</i> and failed to bring a
    proceeding within the limitation period, the creditor would be statute barred
    from taking advantage of enhanced recovery under a s. 38 order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The circumstances of this case are unusual in
    that the earlier discoverability date preceded the coming into force of the <i>LA, 2002</i> so as to trigger the transition
    provision in s. 24(6). On these facts, the operation of s. 12(1) benefits the
    person bringing the claim pursuant to <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 38 order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>For all these reasons, I am satisfied that s.
    12(1) of the <i>LA, 2002</i> requires a
    determination as to the earlier of the discoverability dates as between the
    trustee in bankruptcy and the creditor who commences a proceeding through a s.
    38 order. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The result in this case is that the creditor
    discovered the claim before the <i>LA, 2002</i> came into force, at a time when there was no limitation period for a fraudulent
    conveyance action. Pursuant to s. 24(6), there is no limitation period for this
    action. Therefore, the action is not statute barred and the motion judge erred
    in dismissing the action on the basis of a limitation period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><b><u>Abuse of
    Process</u></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I am satisfied that the motion judge’s bald
    statement that pursuit of the First Fraudulent Conveyance Action would be an
    abuse of process was not a finding that the Second Fraudulent Conveyance Action
    was an abuse of process. It is clear from the reasons that having found that
    the appellant’s claim was statute barred, the motion judge did not engage in an
    analysis of whether the second action was an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set
    aside the order, as well as the costs order, and remit the matter back to the
    commercial list. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span style='"Times New Roman"'><span>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I would fix costs at $25,000, all inclusive, for
    both the motion and the appeal.  </p>
