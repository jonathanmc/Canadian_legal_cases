  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 2, 2008, the applicant, Jonjel Barbu, a
    Canadian citizen, was indicted by a Grand Jury in the United States District
    Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and charged with:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Conspiracy
    to import 1000 kg or more of marijuana contrary to Title 21, U.S.C., Sections
    952(a), 960(a), 960(b)(1)(G) and 963.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         Conspiracy
    to transport and transfer monetary instruments and funds of approximately $2
    million USD with intent to promote the conspiracy to import marijuana contrary
    to Title 21, U.S.C., Sections 952 and 960, in violation of Title 18, U.S.C.,
    section 1956(a)(2)(A); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Knowingly
    attempting to transport, transmit, and transfer, and aiding and abetting the
    attempt to transport, transmit and transfer monetary instruments and funds that
    is, approximately $407,440 USD from a place in the United Sates to Canada
    contrary to Title 21, U.S.C., sections 952(a), 960(a) and 963 and Title 18,
    U.S.C., sections 2 and 1956(a) 2(A).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By diplomatic note dated May 8, 2008, the United States
    formally requested the applicant’s extradition to stand trial in Pennsylvania
    on the offences set out above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 25, 2008, an Authority to Proceed (ATP)
    was issued authorizing representatives of the Attorney General of Canada to
    seek the applicant’s committal for Canadian offences corresponding to this
    conduct, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importing
    a Schedule II controlled substance, contrary          to
    section 6 of the <i>Controlled Drugs and
    Substances            Act</i>, S.C. 1996,
    c. 19; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Possession
    of property obtained by crime, contrary to          section
    354 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C- 46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant was arrested on an extradition warrant in
    October, 2008.  On December 10, 2009, he
    consented to his committal and was subsequently committed for extradition by
    O’Marra J. on that date for the offences set out in the ATP.  No appeal was taken from the extradition
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 11, 2010, the applicant, through his counsel,
    made written submissions to the Minister of Justice regarding his surrender,
    pursuant to s. 43(1) of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18.  He did not
    contest his surrender.  Instead he asked
    the Minister to seek assurances that should he be convicted, he would only be
    sentenced for conduct expressly contained in the surrender order, and that all
    aggravating factors on sentencing be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister ordered the applicant’s surrender on his
    criminal conduct articulated in terms of the U.S. offences for which the United
    States had requested extradition.  The
    Minister declined to seek the assurances requested by the applicant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant seeks judicial review of the Minister’s
    decision. He argues that the Minister erred in ordering his surrender on the
    offences contained in the United States indictment rather than for the Canadian
    offences set out in the Authority to Proceed and the Committal Order.  He also argues that the Minister erred in
    failing to seek the assurances he requested.  He submits that the Minister’s decision is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that the applicant is simply
    attempting to relitigate the issues already settled by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in its recent decision in <i>Canada
    (Justice) v. Fischbacher</i>, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 170.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>

    Record of the Case and Supplemental Record of the Case filed in support of the

    Department of Justice, Organized Crime and Racketeering Section has certified
    that the evidence summarized therein or contained in attached documents is both
    available for trial and is sufficient under the laws of the United States to
    justify prosecution.  No issue is taken

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the Overview of the Record of the Case the nature of the allegations against
    the applicant is stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Jonjel Barbu has been charged with
    various crimes relating to a conspiracy to import large amounts of marijuana
    into the United States from Canada and the laundering of the proceeds from the
    sale of these drugs back into Canada. These charges follow an investigation by
    the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) which revealed that between on or
    about January 1, 2004, and October 23, 2006, Jonjel Barbu was a commercial
    truck driver and a member of a criminal conspiracy that imported illegal drugs
    into the United States from Canada, distributed the illegal drugs in the United
    States, and then laundered the proceeds from the sale of these illegal drugs to
    Canada in order to promote the importation conspiracy. The conspiracy was headed
    by a Canadian drug dealer, Quoc Diep. Other members of the criminal group
    included Quoc Diep’s couriers, which included Jonjel Barbu and Ivo Banovic, and
    his U.S. – based customers, which included Lien Dam, Nguyen Ly and Hang Le.
    Lien Dam, Nguyen Ly and Hang Le have all pleaded guilty to their drug dealing
    activities and are cooperating with the DEA.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Particulars
    of the involvement of the applicant in the conspiracy are set out in the
    Summary of Evidence, in the Record of the Case in paras. 1 and 2 and in the
    Supplemental Record of the Case in paras. 6, 7, 8, 9 and subpara. (c) of para.
    13.  What follows is an overview of these
    facts.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    evidence discloses that in June 2005, the applicant, who was a commercial truck
    driver, smuggled a large quantity of marijuana into the United States using his
    commercial tractor trailer.  He delivered
    the shipment (approximately 100 pounds of marijuana) from Quoc Diep in Canada
    to Lien Dam in Philadelphia.  In exchange,
    Lien Dam gave the applicant $200,000 USD in drug proceeds to take back to Quoc
    Diep in Canada.  A few days later, the
    applicant returned to Philadelphia where he received a further $200,000 USD
    from Lien Dam.  The money was from the
    sale of illegal drugs and was to be delivered to Quoc Diep in Canada.</span></p>

    June 23, 2005, DEA Special Agent Carl Rideout observed Lien Dam give the
    applicant a large bag.  Special Agent
    Rideout contacted the Pennsylvania State Police who later stopped the
    applicant’s truck for a traffic violation.  During the traffic stop, Special Agent Rideout positively identified the
    applicant by his Canadian identification card and seized $407,440 USD – the
    money given to the applicant by Lien Dam to give to Quoc Diep in Canada as
    payment for the marijuana shipment.</span></p>

    conspiracy, occupying the role of drug and proceeds of crime courier.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE EXTRADITION PROCEDURE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Fischbacher, </i>Charron J. gave a very
    helpful review of all stages of Canada’s extradition procedure in paras. 23
    through 56 of the decision.  She began by
    describing double criminality which she described as “a fundamental principle
    of the extradition process codified by the [<i>Extradition
    Act</i>].”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Double
    criminality requires that the conduct upon which the extradition request is
    made be criminal in both the requesting and requested countries.  This requirement is codified in s. 3(1) of
    the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18
    (the “Act”).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>3.
    (1)   A person may be extradited from
    Canada in accordance with this Act and a relevant extradition agreement on the
    request of an extradition partner for the purpose of prosecuting the person or
    imposing a sentence on – or enforcing a sentence imposed on – the person if</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>(a)       subject to a relevant extradition
    agreement, the offence in respect of which the extradition is requested is
    punishable by the extradition partner, by imprisoning or otherwise depriving
    the person of their liberty for a maximum term of two years or more, or by a
    more severe punishment; and</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>(b)       the conduct of the person, had it
    occurred in Canada, would have constituted an offence that is punishable in
    Canada,</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>            (i)        in
    the case of a request based on a               specific
    agreement, by                                                imprisonment
    for a maximum                               term
    of five years or more, or by a             more severe punishment, and</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>            (ii)       in
    any other case, by                                      imprisonment for a maximum                                  term of two
    years or more, or by a                more
    severe punishment, subject                                    to
    a relevant extradition                                            agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            (2)       For
    greater certainty, it is not relevant whether the conduct referred to in
    subsection (1) is named, defined or characterized by the extradition partner in
    the same way as it is in Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly, Canada’s approach to double criminality is
    conduct-based as opposed to offence-based.  Para. 29 of <i>Fischbacher </i>summarizes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a result, it is not necessary that the Canadian
    offence described in the ATP or the committal order “match” the foreign offence
    for which the person is sought or surrendered in name or in terms of its
    constituent elements; it is “the essence of the offence” that is important on
    the conduct-based approach: A.W. La Forest, <i>La
    Forest’s Extradition to and from Canada</i> (3rd  ed. 1991), at p. 69.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no issue in this appeal that the conduct which
    is the subject of the extradition request is criminal in both Canada and the
    United States.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue raised here is whether it is reasonable for
    the Minister to surrender an individual to face prosecution for charges which
    are materially different from the charges described in the ATP and the
    resulting committal order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The United States sought the applicant’s extradition to
    face charges in Pennsylvania for conspiracy to import over 1000 kilograms of
    marijuana, conspiracy to transfer and transport about $2 million USD with
    intent to promote the conspiracy to import marijuana and knowingly attempting
    to transfer funds in the sum of $407,440 USD from a place in the United States
    to Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Authority to Proceed described the corresponding
    Canadian offences as importing a Schedule II controlled substance and possession
    of property obtained by crime.  Noticeably absent was any allegation that the applicant was a member of a
    larger conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 15(3) of the Act provides that an ATP must
    contain three elements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15(3)  The
    authority to proceed must contain</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)      the name or description of the person
    whose extradition is sought;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)     the name of the extradition partner;
    and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)     the name of the offence or offences
    under Canadian law that correspond to the alleged conduct of the person or the
    conduct in respect of which the person was convicted, as long as one of the
    offences would be punishable in accordance with paragraph 3(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant relies heavily on para. 32 of  <i>Fischbacher</i>,<i> </i> where Charron J. states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An ATP is akin to an information or indictment in a
    domestic prosecution in that the corresponding Canadian offence or offences
    listed in an ATP provide the focus of the determination to be made at the
    judicial stage. Accordingly, care must be taken to ensure that an ATP
    accurately identifies the Canadian offence that most closely resembles the
    alleged conduct underlying the foreign offence.  This will necessarily require the Minister, in drafting the ATP, to
    undertake some limited interpretation of the domestic law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Essentially the applicant’s argument is that the American
    offence of conspiracy for which he was indicted is conduct which is also contrary
    to the law of Canada and that the Canadian offence of conspiracy to import
    marijuana is the offence that “most closely resembles the alleged conduct
    underlying the foreign offence.”  Accordingly, the applicant’s position is that a failure to match the
    American offence to the Canadian offence that most closely resembles it means
    that the Minister’s decision to order surrender on the American conspiracy
    charges is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Fischbacher</i>,<i> </i>the United States requested the
    extradition of Mr. Fischbacher to face a charge of first degree murder in
    Arizona.  The ATP that was issued
    described the corresponding Canadian offence as “murder”.  The extradition judge held that the Record of
    the Case did not disclose elements of planning and deliberation as would be
    required for a charge of first degree murder in Canada and accordingly he
    committed Mr. Fischbacher for the offence of second degree murder.  No appeal was taken from the committal
    order.  The Minister then ordered Mr.
    Fischbacher’s surrender for the American offence of first degree murder as
    requested by the United Sates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fischbacher sought judicial review of the
    Minister’s decision before this court.  He conceded his surrender for a charge of second degree murder but
    argued the Minister’s decision to surrender him on the charge of first degree
    murder was unreasonable.  In support of
    his argument, Mr. Fischbacher relied on appellate decisions that have concluded
    that “misalignment” between the offence for which the Minister ordered
    surrender and the offence supported by the evidence at the committal hearing
    may render a surrender decision unreasonable.  This court accepted Mr. Fischbacher’s argument and remitted the matter
    to the Minister for reconsideration.  On
    further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Minister’s appeal was
    allowed and the Minister’s surrender order was restored.  At para. 4 of the decision Charron J. noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding how the
    principle of double criminality should be satisfied, it was open to Parliament
    to define the crimes for which extradition may be sought and ordered either in
    terms of the alleged conduct, or the elements of the foreign offence.  Canada’s chosen approach is unquestionably
    conduct-based.  Thus, extradition is
    permitted when the conduct underlying the foreign offence, if it occurred in
    Canada, would constitute an offence in Canadian law, however named or
    characterized.  So long as the offence
    also falls in the category of extraditable offences, defined by the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18 (the “Act”)
    double criminality is fulfilled.  This
    approach is not only consistent with prevailing international practice, it also
    accords with the principle of comity which demands deference and respect for
    the laws of other nations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The role of the extradition judge is described in para.
    35:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The judge must consider the evidence in light of
    Canadian law and determine whether it reveals conduct that would justify
    committal for the crime listed in the ATP if it had occurred in Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge’s role has been described as a
    limited one.  If he or she is satisfied
    that the impugned conduct would amount to a criminal offence in Canadian law,
    the domestic component of double criminality is satisfied and the person sought
    must be committed for extradition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It then falls to the Minister to determine whether to
    order surrender and if so on what basis.  The power is subject to the provisions of the relevant treaty, the Act
    and must be exercised in accordance with the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. The Minister will balance
    all relevant considerations depending on the specific facts of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If, after this exercise, the Minister determines to
    surrender the fugitive the contents of the surrender order must comply with s. 58
    of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection (b) of s. 58 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            58.       An order of surrender must</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       describe
    the offence in respect of which    the
    extradition is requested, the offence          for
    which the committal was ordered or        the
    conduct for which the person is to be   surrendered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 41 of <i>Fischbacher</i>,
    Charron J. noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nothing in s. 58(b) requires that the Minister
    match or “align” the surrender offence with that listed in the ATP or the
    committal order, nor with the evidence adduced at the hearing. In fact, quite
    the contrary: s. 58(b) provides the Minister with flexibility in crafting an
    order of surrender, and clearly contemplates that the wording of the surrender
    order may differ from that of the ATP and the order of committal: see, <i>e.g. United States of America v. Saad</i> (2004), 183 C.C.C. (3d) 97, (Ont. C.A.), at para. 40.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant seeks to distinguish <i>Fischbacher </i>on the basis that the crime for which extradition was
    sought in that case was first degree murder and the crime for which the
    extradition order was made was second degree murder.  Since the crime of murder was the same and
    since it was only the classification of the offence that was different, the
    applicant argues that the principle in <i>Fischbacher</i> does not apply to his case, where the crime of conspiracy to import and the
    crime of importation are different crimes with different constituent
    elements.  The principle enunciated in <i>Fischbacher</i> is not limited to this
    distinction, nor does s. 58(b) of the Act offer any support to the applicant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant further submits that if the Minister is
    able to extradite for the offence requested by an extradition partner in
    circumstances where the ATP and committal order provide for committal for an
    offence with different constituent elements, the role of the extradition judge
    is emasculated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept these arguments.  In my view, the Act and current jurisprudence
    do not require alignment between the surrender order and the extradition order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Fischbacher</i>,
    the court reviewed appellate decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    and this court that relied on the “misalignment” or “substantially exceeds”
    test, which held that the Minister was required to ensure that the foreign
    evidence (adduced at the committal hearing) satisfied the elements of the
    foreign charge before he could surrender the fugitive for the requested
    offence.  The Supreme Court in clear
    language specifically disapproved of this line of authority.  At para. 49, the court noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect, it is my view that to the extent that <i>Reumayr</i> (2003) and its offspring
    stand for the principle that the Minister is required to “align” the Canadian
    and foreign offences by ensuring that the evidence adduced at an extradition
    hearing supports each element of the foreign offence upon which surrender is
    ordered, these decisions do not represent the law in Canada.  The “misalignment” test adopted by the Court
    of Appeal in this case is incompatible with three key components of extradition
    law:  conduct-based double criminality;
    the foundational principle of comity; and the carefully circumscribed role
    assigned to the extradition judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its consideration of <i>Canada (Minister of Justice) v. Reumayr</i> (2005), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (B.C.
    C.A.) 391, the Supreme Court noted at para. 45:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]lthough the Canadian and American crimes at
    issue had different constituent elements, the words of the Act made it clear
    that “as long as the conduct supports a Canadian offence, it does not matter
    what the offence might be or how the constituent elements are described in
    Canada.  The person is liable to
    extradition”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, provided the evidence adduced at the
    extradition hearing would have constituted a crime in Canada as described in
    the ATP, or amended ATP as the case may be, the domestic component of double
    criminality is met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of this case, the applicant concedes his
    committal for the offences set out in the ATP and the committal order.  Having done so, this in no way precludes the
    Minister from exercising his discretion to order surrender of the applicant on
    his criminal conduct articulated in terms of the U.S. offences.  Section 58(b) of the Act provides for this
    discretion.  In my view, <i>Fischbacher</i> is dispositive of the appeal
    in this respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant further requested the Minister to seek
    assurances that any and all aggravating factors on sentence, in the event of
    his conviction on any of the charges, be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A prominent United States attorney had provided an opinion
    to counsel for the applicant wherein it was stated that in the United States,
    aggravating factors needed only to be proved on a preponderance of the evidence,
    which is comparable to the civil standard of proof in Canadian law.  The Minister refused to seek such assurances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the differences between evidentiary
    standards of proof and factors that can be considered in sentencing do not
    alone make the applicant’s surrender to the United States unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test to be applied is whether surrender in the
    particular circumstances would “shock the conscience”, or whether the person
    faces “a situation that is simply unacceptable”,  <i>Lake v.
    Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761, para. 31.  The legal system of a requesting state need
    not mirror that of Canada in order for extradition to be consistent with the
    principles of fundamental justice or for the Minister’s surrender order to be
    reasonable.  The respondent in its factum
    at para. 29 quotes La Forest J. in <i>Canada
    v. Schmidt</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I see nothing unjust in surrendering to a foreign
    country a person accused of having committed a crime there for trial in the
    ordinary way in accordance with the system for the administration of justice
    prevailing in that country simply because that system is substantially
    different from ours with different checks and balances. The judicial process in
    a foreign country must not be subjected to finicky evaluations against the
    rules governing the legal process in this country. A judicial system is not,
    for example, fundamentally unjust – indeed it may in its practical workings be
    as just as ours – because it functions on the basis of an investigatory system
    without a presumption of innocence or, generally, because its procedural or evidentiary
    safeguards have none of the rigours of our system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Minister noted in his correspondence to counsel
    for the applicant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Extradition is based on the principle of comity or
    respect for the laws of our treaty partners.  In cases where there is a difference between the treaty partner’s
    justice system and our own, the principle of comity requires that we recognize
    the foreign authorities’ right to govern their own process.  As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in <i>Republic of Argentina v. Mellino</i> (1987),
    33 C.C.C. (3d) 334, “the assumption that the requesting state will give the
    fugitive a fair trial according to its law underlies the whole theory and
    practice of extradition.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            I
    also bear in mind the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>United States of America v. Burns</i>, <i>supra</i>, which established the principle
    that “individuals who choose to leave Canada leave behind Canadian law and
    procedures and must generally accept the local law, procedure and punishments
    which the foreign state applies to its own residents.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            In
    my view, it would be inappropriate to make Mr. Barbu’s surrender conditional
    upon the receipt of an assurance which seeks to alter the applicable standard
    of proof in the American proceedings as this would offend the principle of comity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Minister’s decision to defer to the

    District Court on three counts alleging that he was a member of a large-scale
    drug conspiracy to import 1000 kilograms or more of marijuana and to illegally
    launder approximately $2 million.  The
    Minister of Justice issued an Authority to Proceed (ATP), not in terms of the alleged
    conduct underlying the U.S. indictment, but in terms of Canadian offences
    involving different conduct, namely that the applicant had engaged in single
    acts of importing 100 pounds of marijuana and possessing $400,000 obtained by
    crime.  </span></p>

    unlawful conspiracy, but it is not the conduct of conspiracy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At the committal hearing in Canada, the appellant did not
    face the allegation that he was a member of a large-scale drug importing
    conspiracy involving 1000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of marijuana and $2
    million.  The extradition judge considered
    the different and narrower allegation that on one occasion the applicant had
    imported 100 pounds of marijuana and handled approximately $400,000 of
    drug-related money.  After the applicant
    consented to surrender on those offences, the Minister reverted to the terms of
    the U.S. indictment and ordered that the applicant be surrendered on charges
    alleging the different and much more serious conduct. </span></p>

    Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18 (the “Act”) involves a three-stage process that
    engages both executive and judicial functions.  The judicial function is to ensure that the basic requirements of
    justice are met before a person is surrendered for trial in the requesting
    state.  It is a basic requirement of
    justice that there is a judicial determination</span><span style='line-height:200%;'> that the requesting state

    crime alleged and should stand trial for it.  In my view, the Minister’s decision to issue a surrender order for

    hearing undermined the judicial phase and the integrity and fairness of the

  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>2. Canada (Justice) v. Fischbacher</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I agree that this application must be determined in
    accordance with the law as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <i>Canada (Justice) v. Fischbacher</i>, [2009]
    3 S.C.R. 170.  That decision re-affirms
    the conduct-based approach to the double criminality requirement laid down by
    the Act.  <i>Fischbacher</i> overrules decisions of this and other courts that
    appeared to require a “match” or “alignment” between the elements of the
    foreign offence for which the person is sought and the elements of the Canadian
    offence for which the person is committed.  I agree that <i>Fischbacher</i> decides that when making the decision whether to surrender the person sought,
    the Minister need not engage in a minute consideration of the elements of the
    foreign offence, and that the Minister is not restricted to surrendering
    persons sought for extradition only where there was evidence before the
    extradition judge to establish each and every constituent element of the
    foreign offence.  Provided the foreign
    offence is based on conduct that is also criminal under Canadian law, the
    Minister has the discretion to issue a surrender order in terms of the foreign
    charges.  <i>Fischbacher</i> eliminates any need to “align” or “match” the elements
    of the foreign and Canadian offences as that “would require the Minister to
    effectively second-guess the foreign state’s assessment of its own law” and
    offend the principle of comity (para. 5).  It is symmetry of conduct “not symmetry between the elements of the
    Canadian and foreign offences” that is “determinative of double criminality”
    (para. 50). </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, however, the Supreme Court of Canada’s analysis
    of the conduct-based approach in <i>Fischbacher</i> should not be read as conferring an open-ended discretion on the Minister to
    surrender a person for extradition for a different offence based upon different
    conduct than that underlying the Canadian offence considered by the extradition
    judge. </span></p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>3. Harmonization of the three phases of the extradition
    process</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The reasoning in <i>Fischbacher</i> is premised upon the need to harmonize all phases of the extradition process
    and to respect important principles of extradition law that need to be taken
    into account when assessing the reasonableness of the Minister’s surrender
    decision.  A key element in the
    harmonization of the executive and judicial phases of the extradition process
    is the direction in para. 32 of <i>Fischbacher</i> that the Minister must take care that the ATP “accurately identifies the
    Canadian offence that most closely resembles the alleged conduct underlying the
    foreign offence.” This ensures that the conduct underlying the Canadian offence
    that is the focus of attention at the committal hearing closely resembles the conduct
    underlying the foreign offence for which the person is surrendered.  If the conduct considered at the extradition
    hearing does not closely resemble the conduct underlying the offence for which
    the person sought is surrendered, there is a disconnect between the executive
    and judicial phases of the process that frustrates and undermines the judicial
    phase and renders the executive surrender decision unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The <i>Extradition Act</i> assigns responsibility for the first phase of the extradition process to the
    executive.  The Minister is given the
    discretion to issue an ATP.  It is the
    legal document that, pursuant to s. 15, “authorizes the Attorney General to
    seek, on behalf of the extradition partner, an order of the court for the
    committal” into custody of the person sought to await surrender.  It is the ATP that defines the scope of the
    inquiry before the extradition judge at the committal hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The second phase is judicial.  Pursuant to s. 29, the extradition judge is charged with the task of
    making a judicial determination as to whether there is sufficient evidence of
    conduct “that, had it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in
    Canada on the offence set out in the [ATP]”.  While the rules of evidence are relaxed for extradition hearings, the
    extradition judge retains a vitally important role in ensuring the integrity
    and fairness of the extradition process.  The judicial phase of the extradition process ensures that the person
    sought (often as in this case a Canadian citizen) will be sent to the foreign
    jurisdiction for trial on the foreign charges only if the Attorney General,
    acting on behalf of the extradition partner, is able to lead evidence that
    would justify committal for trial in Canada.</span></p>

    the court held, at para. 19, that the hearing is required </span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>to
    ensure that “the basic demands of justice” are observed and that the person
    sought for extradition is accorded “fair process”.  </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The court also held at para. 19 that the basic demands of
    justice</span><span style='line-height:200%;
'> require that “the requesting state must establish
    that there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the person sought may have
    committed the offence” and that “[a] person cannot be sent from the country on
    mere demand or surmise.”  The court
    added, at para. 20, that “before a person can be extradited, there must be a
    judicial determination that the requesting state has established a <i>prima
    facie</i> case that the person sought committed the crime alleged and should
    stand trial for it.”  <i>Ferras</i> speaks directly to the need to
    harmonize the judicial and executive phases of the extradition process.  The “separate and independent judicial phase
    recognizes that extradition involves both executive and judicial acts…[and]<i> </i>provides a check against state excess
    by protecting the integrity of the proceedings and the interests of the ‘named
    person’ in relation to the state process” (para. 23).  The judicial phase “must not play a
    supportive or subservient role to the executive” but rather “must provide real
    protection against extradition in the absence of an adequate case against the
    person sought” (para. 23).</span></p>

    once again engaged.  In the words of s.
    40, “[t]he Minister may…personally order that the person be surrendered to the
    extradition partner.”  As Charron J. put
    it in <i>Fischbacher</i>, at para. 23, the
    exercise of executive discretion effectively “bookends the judicial phase”,
    defining the inquiry before the extradition judge and implementing the judicial

    and the jurisdiction of the provincial appellate courts to entertain appeals
    from the committal order of the extradition judge (s. 49) and applications for
    judicial review of the Minister’s surrender order (s. 57).  The standard of review that applies to an
    application for judicial review was described by this court in <i>United States of America v. Whitely</i> (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 794 at p. 805, aff’d [1996] 1 S.C.R. 467:</span></p>

    reasonableness, it seems to me important that the Act should be interpreted in
    a manner that harmonizes and reconciles the three stage “executive-judicial-executive”
    extradition process.  Each stage should
    be seen in relation to the other two stages.  The powers conferred at one stage are shaped and defined by the powers
    to be exercised at the other stages.  A
    decision made at one stage should not ignore, usurp or undermine authority that
    properly adheres to decisions made at a different stage.  Just as this court must accord appropriate
    deference to the fact-finding role of the extradition judge and to the
    executive discretion of the Minister, the Minister must pay appropriate heed to
    the role of the extradition judge when framing the ATP and making the surrender
    decision.</span></p>

    comity that underlies the entire process; and the principle of deference to

    ATP.  This is a crucial decision as the
    ATP both authorizes the Attorney General to seek committal and provides the
    focus for the judicial phase to follow at the committal stage.  The scope of the inquiry before the extradition
    judge is to decide whether there is evidence that would justify committal for trial
    in Canada on the Canadian offences identified in the ATP. </span></p>

    discretionary, as with all discretionary decisions the law imposes certain
    limits.  In <i>Fischbacher</i>, at para. 32, Charron J. recognized that the discretion
    to issue the ATP is shaped and, as I read her reasons, limited by the purpose
    of the ATP in defining what is to follow as the extradition process proceeds to
    the judicial phase and then returns to the executive phase:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An ATP is akin to an information or indictment in a domestic
    prosecution in that the corresponding Canadian offence or offences listed in an
    ATP provide the focus of the determination to be made at the judicial
    stage.&nbsp; Accordingly, <i>care must be
    taken to ensure that an ATP accurately identifies the Canadian offence that
    most closely resembles the alleged conduct underlying the foreign
    offence.&nbsp; This will necessarily require the Minister, in drafting the ATP,
    to undertake some limited interpretation of the domestic law</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    an ATP accurately identifies the Canadian offence that most closely resembles
    the alleged conduct underlying the foreign offence” is obvious.  If the judicial phase is to play the essential
    role contemplated by <i>Ferras</i> in
    ensuring the integrity of the extradition process, the evidence led at the
    committal hearing and considered by the extradition judge must relate to the
    alleged conduct that underlies the foreign offence.  It does not matter if the foreign law
    attaches a different criminal label to the conduct.  It does matter that throughout the
    extradition process, the Minister and the extradition judge exercise their
    discretionary and decision-making powers in relation to the same conduct.</span></p>

    conspiracy.  The prosecution alleges a
    criminal conspiracy to import large quantities of marijuana and ecstasy into
    the United States from Canada over a 34-month period and to launder the
    proceeds of those crimes back into Canada, involving the shipment of between 75

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importing

    between the elements of the foreign offence and elements of the corresponding
    Canadian offence, I fail to see how, to paraphrase para. 32 of <i>Fischbacher</i>, it can be said that the ATP
    accurately identified the Canadian offences that most closely resemble the
    alleged conduct underlying the foreign offences.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, this case is distinguishable from <i>Fischbacher</i>.  There, the foreign indictment and surrender
    order alleged first degree murder while the ATP and the committal order alleged
    second degree murder.  The definition of
    the elements for various degrees of murder varies from jurisdiction to
    jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court held that
    the demands of the extradition process did not require a precise alignment of
    foreign and Canadian definitions of the degrees of murder.  So long as the conduct alleged against the
    person sought amounted to murder under Canadian law, it was open to the
    Minister to surrender the person for trial on murder, however defined, in the
    requesting state.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Here the problem runs deeper and is more fundamental.  The discrepancy present in this case lies in
    the marked difference between the <i>conduct</i> underlying the foreign offences and the <i>conduct</i> underlying the Canadian offences set out in the ATP and considered at the
    extradition hearing.  The conduct
    involved in being a participant in a 34-month drug importing conspiracy
    involving 2,200 pounds of marijuana and $2 million is qualitatively different
    and more serious than being involved in a single transaction of importing 100
    pounds of marijuana and handling $400,000.  As a result, there has been no judicial determination that there is
    sufficient evidence of the different and more serious conduct underlying the
    U.S. offences.  In my view, to issue a
    surrender order unsupported by such a judicial determination is inconsistent
    with the design of the Act and would undermine the fairness and integrity of the
    entire extradition process. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nothing in s. 58(<i>b</i>) requires that the Minister match or “align”
    the surrender offence with that listed in the ATP or the committal order, nor
    with the evidence adduced at the hearing.&nbsp; In fact, quite the
    contrary:&nbsp; s. 58(<i>b</i>) provides the Minister with flexibility in
    crafting an order of surrender, and clearly contemplates that the wording of
    the surrender order may differ from that of the ATP and the order of
    committal…[Citation omitted.]</p>

    compliance with the court’s earlier direction in para. 32 “to ensure that an
    ATP accurately identifies the Canadian offence that most closely resembles the
    alleged conduct underlying the foreign offence.”  I do not agree that it allows the Minister to
    issue a surrender order for an offence involving conduct markedly different
    from the conduct underlying the Canadian offence identified in the ATP and
    considered by the extradition judge.  Otherwise,
    the executive surrender decision is disconnected from the judicial committal
    decision to the point where the surrender decision circumvents and ignores the
    judicial component of the extradition process. </span></p>

    to test the limits of the respondent’s argument.  If the foreign charge was murder, could the
    Minister issue an ATP for assault, secure a committal for assault and then
    surrender the person sought for murder? Counsel for the respondent more or less
    conceded that the logic of his argument required him to answer “yes”.  He stated, however, that if the foreign
    charge was murder, the Minister could be trusted not to issue an ATP for
    assault.  In my view, that is not a
    satisfactory answer.  It fails to
    recognize the legal limits that are imposed on the Minister’s discretion by the
    overall scheme of the Act, as interpreted in <i>Fischbacher</i> and <i>Ferras</i>. </span></p>
