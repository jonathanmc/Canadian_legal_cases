  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of oral argument, the court indicated
    that the appeal by the appellant Brian McCarthy from his conviction for fraud
    on the public was dismissed and that the Crown appeal from the appellant’s
    acquittal on two charges of fraud on a company, Southbridge Capital, was
    dismissed as abandoned.  The court
    indicated that we would shortly release reasons for that disposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three charges that are the subject of the appeals concern
    the 2003 and 2004 financial statements of a small public company, Betacom, of
    which the appellant was president and CEO.  There was no dispute at trial that the financial statements were false
    and misleading in material respects in overstating sales, revenue and cost of
    sales and failing to record that Betacom had taken on a $300,000 loan (the
    Lakefield loan).  While the appellant had
    not prepared the financial statements, the Crown alleged that he was aware that
    the statements were false and misleading.  The trial judge found that sometime after February 2003, the appellant knew
    that the sales, revenues and costs of sales had been falsified.  This was the basis for the conviction for
    fraud on the public.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge’s reasons
    were inadequate in failing to deal with substantial inconsistencies between the
    two principal Crown witnesses, Phil Spensieri, Betacom’s Chief Operating
    Officer, and Douglas McIntyre, the Chief Financial Officer, and contradictions
    between the evidence of these two witnesses and other more reliable Crown
    witnesses.  The Appellant also submits
    that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct herself as to the danger of
    acting on the unconfirmed evidence of these two highly suspect witnesses.  Finally, the appellant submits that the
    verdicts are inconsistent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first two grounds of appeal can be dealt with
    together.  The reasons reveal that the
    trial judge was aware of the inconsistencies in the evidence of Spensieri and
    McIntyre.  It was not necessary for her
    to specifically refer to all the inconsistencies.  But, more importantly the conviction turned
    on the independent evidence of the appellant’s friend, Mr. Gorney, not the
    evidence of Spensieri and McIntyre.  That
    evidence, on its own, established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    was aware that the financial statements were false in relation to revenue.  The trial judge dealt with that evidence at
    length and explained why she did not accept the appellant’s version of those
    events.  The trial judge only relied upon
    Spensieri’s evidence when it favoured the appellant to find that the appellant
    did not have the requisite intent to defraud when the Southbridge loans were
    made.  She did not rely upon the evidence
    of McIntyre and Spensieri when making findings against the appellant on the
    only real issue in the case, whether the appellant had the intent to defraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Smith argues on behalf of the appellant that a
    finding of intent could not rest solely on the evidence of Mr. Gorney and that
    the trial judge must have relied upon the highly suspect evidence of McIntyre
    and Spensieri.  In our view, once the trial
    judge accepted Mr. Gorney’s evidence and rejected the appellant’s evidence, a
    finding of intent was inevitable and did not depend upon the disputed evidence
    of McIntyre and Spensieri.  Mr. Gorney’s
    evidence established that the appellant asked him to sign a false audit
    confirmation letter, confirming sales to Mr. Gorney’s company.  While the appellant may have relied upon
    McIntyre and Spensieri to prepare the financial statements, his area of
    expertise <span class=GramE>was sales</span>.  He could have had only one reason for asking Mr. Gorney to sign the
    false confirmation letter, namely, to inflate the revenue figures in the
    audited statements, which would be relied upon by the public.  This finding did not depend upon any of the
    evidence of McIntyre and Spensieri.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to the first two
    grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for inconsistent verdicts is whether on any
    realistic view of the evidence, the verdicts cannot be reconciled on any
    rational or logical basis.  In our view,
    the verdicts are explicable.  The trial
    judge found that the appellant did not have the requisite fraudulent intent
    until many months after Southbridge made the loans to Betacom.  Hence the acquittals on the two counts that
    named Southbridge as the victim.  However, the trial judge found, based on Mr. Gorney’s evidence, that the
    appellant had <span class=GramE>an intent</span> to defraud, at least after May
    2003 when the false audit confirmation letter was submitted.  Thereafter, members of the public relied upon
    the false financial statements, which included the inflated revenue figures,
    when investing in the company.  This
    finding explains the conviction for fraud on the public.  The verdicts are not inconsistent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is
    dismissed.  Crown counsel indicated that
    the Crown had no interest in pursuing its appeal from the two acquittals if the
    conviction was upheld.  Accordingly, the
    Crown appeal is dismissed as abandoned.</p>
