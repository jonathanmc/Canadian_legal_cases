  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the late evening of April
    18, 2005, David Dickerson was drinking at Carey’s Pub &amp; Grill, a college pub
    in London Ontario. Shortly after midnight, David Radcliffe, who had been
    drinking elsewhere that evening, arrived at the pub. He continued drinking
    there until the 2 a.m. closing time when both he and Mr. Dickerson left.
    Shortly thereafter, Mr. Radcliffe, unprovoked, punched Mr. Dickerson in the head
    with enough force to cause significant brain injury and permanent disability.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dickerson sued Mr.
    Radcliffe. He also sued the owners and an employee of the pub (collectively
    Carey’s), relying on the civil liability of persons selling liquor created by
    s. 39 of the <i>Liquor Licence Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19 (the “Act”).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the jury found Mr.
    Radcliffe 100% responsible for Mr. Dickerson’s injuries, while his claim
    against Carey’s was dismissed. He now appeals against Carey’s.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge instructed the
    jury to answer the following question: did Carey’s serve beer to Mr. Radcliffe
    when his condition was such that to drink the beer would intoxicate him, or
    increase his level of intoxication, so that he would be a danger of causing
    injury to another person? They answered no.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dickerson’s primary
    argument is that in putting this question to the jury, the trial judge
    misdirected them as to the legal requirements for liability under s. 39. He
    also argues that the jury’s answer is unsupported by the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I
    do not agree with either argument, and I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Radcliffe testified that he
    had a barbeque that evening at his home, where he consumed two or three bottles
    of beer. At about 11:45 p.m., he and two friends left and went to a school pub
    where they split a pitcher of beer. Shortly after midnight, they moved on to
    Carey’s, where they shared two more pitchers of beer before closing time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Carey’s evidence was that Mr.
    Radcliffe and his friends were well behaved while there, and that its employees
    did not see any patrons that night who were sufficiently intoxicated to be
    refused service or to be removed from the bar. Mr. Radcliffe, on the other hand,
    testified that his speech and balance were impaired and that he thought a
    bartender would have known that he was intoxicated.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At closing time, Mr. Dickerson
    and his friends left the pub, as did the Radcliffe group. In the parking lot
    there was an exchange of words and a minor scuffle between the two groups.
    Carey’s noticed this and two of its people came outside, broke up the
    altercation, and told the groups to go their separate ways. Carey’s evidence
    was that both groups appeared to calm down and speak rationally. However,
    shortly thereafter the groups crossed paths again at a nearby location. A fight
    ensued, and Mr. Radcliffe assaulted Mr. Dickerson, leaving him with a disabling
    brain injury.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CHARGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first two questions put to
    the jury by the trial judge concern Mr. Radcliffe’s liability. He instructed
    them that there was no doubt about Mr. Radcliffe’s responsibility for Mr.
    Dickerson’s injuries. Rather, the critical question was the liability of
    Carey’s.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning to this, the trial
    judge instructed the jury about the liability of a commercial establishment
    both under the common law of negligence and under s. 39 of the Act. No argument
    is raised in this court about his instruction on the common law. The
    appellant’s complaint is about the instruction that was given concerning s. 39.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The relevant parts of s. 39
    read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Civil
    Liability</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>39.</b> The
    following rules apply if a person or an agent or employee of a person sells
    liquor to or for a person whose condition is such that the consumption of
    liquor would apparently intoxicate the person or increase the person’s
    intoxication so that he or she would be in danger of causing injury to himself
    or herself or injury or damage to another person or the property of another
    person:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. If the person to or for whom the liquor is sold
    commits suicide or meets death by accident while so intoxicated, an action
    under Part V of the <i>Family Law Act</i> lies against the person who or whose employee or agent sold the liquor.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. If the person to or for whom the liquor is sold
    causes injury or damage to another person or the property of another person
    while so intoxicated, the other person is entitled to recover an amount as
    compensation for the injury or damage from the person who or whose employee or
    agent sold the liquor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the course of his charge to
    the jury on this issue, the trial judge both repeated the precise language of
    the section and adapted it to the facts of this case. He also instructed the
    jury, on the one hand, that over-service alone did not render Carey’s liable,
    but on the other hand, that visible signs of impairment were not necessary for
    liability. He summarized the standard of care required by both s. 39 and the
    common law in the following language:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case Carey’s a commercial host that makes
    money from the sale of alcohol to its patrons may be found liable under both
    common law and statute law if it served a patron while intoxicated or over
    served a patron while intoxicated or over served that patron, either of those
    two, to a point of intoxication where it was reasonably foreseeable that the
    patron’s condition was such that he might harm himself or someone else.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This instruction was captured
    in the third question put to the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. Did Carey’s Pub and Grill sell beer to David
    Radcliffe when his condition was such that to drink the beer would intoxicate
    him or increase his level of intoxication so that he would be a danger of
    causing injury to another person? <span class=GramE>Yes,</span> or no.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge told the jury
    that if they answered “no” to this question it was “all over”. However he
    instructed them that if they answered “yes”, there were two further questions,
    questions 4 and 5, that they must consider:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. Did Daniel Dickerson fall into a category of
    other persons it was foreseeable David Radcliffe was in danger of injuring? Yes
    or no.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. If the answer to that is “yes”, you then say,
    Did Carey’s Pub and Grill take reasonable, affirmative action to prevent
    foreseeable injury to Daniel Dickerson?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <span class=GramE>jury
    returned with a “no” answer</span> to question 3, and, as they had been
    instructed, did not go on to answer questions 4 and 5.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPELLANT’S POSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s principal
    argument concerns s. 39 of the Act and the standard of care it requires. He
    says that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that reasonable
    foreseeability applied to both the standard of care required by s. 39 and to
    the claim based on the common law of negligence. He argues that s. 39 simply
    requires over-service of the patron to the point of intoxication (or continued
    service after that point) followed by injury caused by that patron. He cites
    three cases to support this proposition. He says that the words of the section
    “… so that he … would be in danger of causing injury … to another person” are
    merely descriptive of the harm that could follow over-service. Finally, the
    appellant argues that the error is compounded by the further questions put to
    the jury, namely questions 4 and 5. He says that these questions contributed to
    the jury being misled in addressing question 3.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s second argument
    is that, in any event, the evidence was inconsistent with the jury’s answer to question
    3, and for this reason as well, a new trial is required.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Section 39 Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the
    trial judge misdirected the jury in explaining the standard of care required by
    s. 39 of the Act and that this misdirection is reflected in the question put to
    them on this issue namely, question 3.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To obtain the new trial he
    seeks, the appellant must show that this instruction misstated the law on a
    critical issue: see <i>Pereira v. Hamilton
    Township Farmers’ Mutual Fire Insurance Co.</i> (2006), 267 D.L.R. (4th) 690
    (Ont. C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 76. There can be no doubt about
    the importance of this issue in this trial. The question is whether the trial judge
    misstated the relevant law for the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant says that the
    trial judge erred by telling the jury that the commercial establishment does
    not breach the requirements of s. 39 merely by over serving a patron to the
    point of intoxication (as the appellant contends), but rather must be over
    served to the point where it is reasonably foreseeable that the patron’s
    condition is such that he might harm another person.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not agree with this
    submission for the following reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 39 in its present form has
    been in the Act since 1990. It was first introduced into the legislation in very
    similar form in 1946, to replace a differently worded provision first enacted
    in 1889. The 1889 legislation had simply rendered a seller of liquor liable to
    anyone injured by someone intoxicated by the liquor furnished by the seller. The
    appellant maintains that s. 39 does not require any foreseeability of <span
class=GramE>harm,</span> However the cases he cites for that proposition were
    all decided under the 1889 legislation, which said nothing about the degree of over-service
    required to create the risk necessary to trigger the liability of the
    commercial establishment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 39 is different in this
    regard. In its current form, s. 39 imposes a statutory liability in certain
    circumstances on a commercial establishment for the harm caused by its business
    of selling liquor. This reflects the general policy of the Act to regulate the
    production, sale and use of liquor in the interest of safety and the general
    welfare of the public: see <i>R. v. Royal
    Canadian Legion</i>, [1971] 3 O.R. 552, at 556 (C.A.). It imposes special
    responsibilities on those who would profit from the supply and sale of alcohol
    in order to reduce the risk associated with that <span class=GramE>trade.:</span> see <i>Childs v. <span class=SpellE>Desmoreaux</span></i>,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. 643, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 20.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite the existence of this
    statutory liability for over sixty years, it has received surprisingly little
    attention in the jurisprudence compared to the common law of negligence
    applicable to commercial establishments.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 39 has two parts.
    First, the first paragraph defines the standard of care required of a seller of
    liquor. Its meaning is the focus of the appellant’s argument in this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second part is Rules 1 and
    2, which describe the circumstances in which consequences will follow when the standard
    of care is breached. Rule 2 asks simply whether the patron who was served in
    breach of the seller’s standard of care caused injury to another person while
    so intoxicated. If so, compensation follows.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To repeat, the standard of care
    set out in s. 39 is as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The following rules apply if a person or an agent
    or employee of a person sells liquor to or for a person whose condition is such
    that the consumption of liquor would apparently intoxicate the person or
    increase the person’s intoxication so that he or she would be in danger of
    causing injury to himself or herself or injury or damage to another person or
    the property of another person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I cannot agree with the
    appellant that this language sets out a standard that is breached by simply
    over serving a patron to the point of intoxication. That would render the words
    “…so that he or she would be in danger of causing injury to himself or herself
    or injury or damage to another person or the property of another person” devoid
    of legal meaning. I do not agree that the legislature intended these words to
    be without legal effect but merely descriptive of the kind of harm that may
    follow from over-service. Legislatures are not in the habit of writing
    legislation that is purely descriptive but without legal meaning.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>More importantly, the plain and
    ordinary meaning of these words does carry legal significance. These words
    describe the level of over-service that attracts liability because of the risk
    it creates. In the factual context of this case, the over-service must produce
    the patron’s intoxication or increase it sufficiently that the patron would be
    in danger of injuring another person. It requires a risk assessment by the
    commercial establishment. That assessment is aptly captured in the language of
    the common law: if the patron is over served to the point of intoxication or
    beyond, such that it is reasonably foreseeable that the patron may injure
    another, the commercial establishment breaches the statutory standard of care
    required by s. 39.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Not only is this the plain and
    ordinary meaning of the language in s. 39, it faithfully serves the policy of
    the Act, which is to place significant responsibilities on the commercial
    seller of liquor to act in the protection of the public. It calibrates the
    degree of over-service needed to trigger the statutory liability of the
    commercial establishment, thereby defining the responsibility placed on that
    establishment by the legislature to protect the public while pursuing its own
    commercial interest in the sale of liquor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given this statutory liability
    imposed on Carey’s by s. 39, I can see no error in the question (question 3)
    that the trial judge put to the jury on this issue, nor in the charge <span
class=GramE>he gave</span> to the jury explaining it. He correctly told them
    that the mere fact of over-service does not attract liability. He then
    instructed the jury by reading the language of s. 39 to them, adapting it to
    the facts of this case, and telling them that Carey’s breached its standard of
    care if it served a patron to or beyond the point of intoxication where it was
    reasonably foreseeable that the patron’s condition was such that he might harm
    himself or someone else. These instructions properly charge the jury with the
    task required of them by s. 39 of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then properly reflected
    this instruction in question 3. In every relevant respect, that question is in
    the precise language of s. 39 with one omission that is innocuous. The wisdom
    of tracking the language of s. 39 when it is required to put this statutory
    liability to the jury was underlined by this court in <span class=SpellE><i>Picka</i></span><i> Estate v. Porter</i>, [1980] O.J. 252 (C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    7. Where both the statutory liability of the commercial establishment and its
    common law liability in negligence are being put to the jury, it may be, as <span
class=GramE>here, that</span> the same question, using the language of s. 39,
    will suffice, given the facts of the particular case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The one omission is that
    question 3 does not include the word “apparently”. This is harmless because, in
    his instruction leading up to this question, the trial judge included the word
    several times in explaining the question to the jury. In addition, this court
    has been clear that s. 39 does not require visible signs of intoxication. That
    is not the contribution of “apparently” to s. 39: see <span class=SpellE><i>MacIntyre</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Grigg</span></i> (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 161
    (C.A.). The question is whether, in all the circumstances, the service produces
    a level of intoxication sufficient that the patron would foreseeably be in
    danger of injuring another person. That is what the jury was asked to decide.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While it is not necessary to
    decide in this case, there are two respects in which the statutory liability
    analysis required by s. 39 may differ from that required by the common law of
    negligence, although in practice circumstances where either would arise are
    difficult to imagine.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, section s. 39 requires
    only that the risk of injury be reasonably foreseeable, not that in a general
    way, the type or kind of injury actually suffered be reasonably foreseeable.
    Second, s. 39 requires only that there be a reasonably foreseeable risk of
    injury to another person, not that the person injured be within the category of
    persons foreseeably at risk. These issues do not arise in this case, as the
    jury evidently concluded that there was no foreseeable risk of injury at all.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant&rsquo;s final argument on the
    s. 39 issue seeks to draw some help from questions 4 and 5. The appellant says that
    these questions would have misled the jury about the task required of it by
    question 3. The simple answer is that these questions could not have affected
    the jury’s approach to question 3 because they were clearly told not to
    consider those two questions unless they answered question 3 affirmatively.
    They followed that instruction and answered question 3 without considering
    questions 4 and 5. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While consideration of any
    reasonable precautions taken to reduce or eliminate the risk posed by the
    patron taken by the commercial establishment in a particular case are probably
    better considered as part of the statutory liability assessment rather than as
    a separate question, no harm was done in this case because the jury found no
    statutory liability without the need to consider any affirmative action by
    Carey’s.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary therefore, I can see
    no error in the question of statutory liability put to the jury or the charge
    explaining it. Their negative answer to the question was not the product of
    erroneous legal instruction, since there was none.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Insufficient Evidence Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s second argument
    is that, in any event, the evidence does not sustain the jury’s negative answer
    to question 3.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This argument must be rejected.
    There was ample evidence to support the jury’s conclusion that Carey’s did not
    over serve Mr. Radcliffe to the point where he would be in danger of causing
    injury to himself or another person. The verdict is not plainly unreasonable
    and unjust and I would not interfere with it.</span></p>
