    decision of Klowak J. wherein she dismissed the appellant’s motion for summary
    judgment that sought to dismiss the third party claim of the respondent City of
    Brampton against Page + Steele Incorporated, and that sought to dismiss the
    fourth party claim of Page + Steele Incorporated for contribution and indemnity
    from the appellant, Stephenson Engineering Limited</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither the Third Party nor the other Fourth Parties
    take any position on the appeal, nor did they take any position on the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Fourth Party appellant takes the position that an
    agreement entered into between the Corporation of the City of Brampton (“Brampton”)
    and Aecon Buildings, A Division of Aecon Construction Group Inc. (“Aecon”)
    prior to the litigation is champertous and an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This dispute arose in the context of a $46 million
    construction contract for the building of the Brampton Performing Arts
    Centre.  Aecon has claimed damages for breach
    of contract arising from delays in the project for which it says it is entitled
    to be compensated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2006, Aecon and Brampton engaged in discussions
    which resulted in them reaching an agreement in principle in December, 2006 on
    how to proceed with their outstanding disputes. Those discussions culminated in
    a formal written agreement between the two parties dated February 8, 2007, a
    date that is after the issuance of the Statement of Claim wherein Aecon is
    plaintiff and Brampton is defendant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the agreement is an abuse of
    process on the following bases:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.         It is champertous;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.         The plea of adversity between Aecon and
    Brampton as set out in  the
    statement of claim is a sham; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.         The agreement between Aecon and
    Brampton was not disclosed as soon
    as it was completed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge characterized the agreement as one
    which:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[S]imply restricts [the] plaintiff’s recovery from
    the defendant to what the defendant might recover from the Third Party. In
    effect, it simply caps the plaintiff’s proceeds and resolves that part of the
    claim for which the defendant might itself be severally liable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At its core, the agreement provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Aecon would issue a statement of claim
    against Brampton and that within five days Brampton would file a cross-claim,
    Third Party Claim or other appropriate procedural mechanism against Page + Steele
    to make them a party to the action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         Brampton would prosecute the Third
    Party Claim against Page + Steele.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Aecon waived its right to collect any
    damages from Brampton in relation to the claims against Page + Steele – except
    to the extent that Brampton was awarded damages or otherwise recovered any sum
    from a party other than Aecon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Essentially, Brampton agreed to advance claims against Page
    + Steele on Aecon’s behalf and Aecon agreed to cap its damage claims against
    Brampton to any amounts Brampton recovered from Page + Steele and its
    subconsultants (the “consultants”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this agreement is not champertous nor does
    it “smack of trafficking in litigation”.   Clearly, Aecon and Brampton both have a financial interest in the
    litigation – Aecon to recover what it says it is owed as a result of the construction
    delays and Brampton to ensure that if Aecon is found to be owed any further
    money that such money comes from the consultants that Brampton alleges are
    responsible for the delays.  Neither Brampton
    nor Aecon could be described as a stranger to the litigation – both have a very
    real financial interest in its outcome.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the crux of the agreement between Brampton
    and Aecon is merely to cap the damages for which Brampton may be liable to
    Aecon and nothing more.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Statement of Claim was issued before the agreement
    between Aecon and Brampton was reduced to writing. The agreement was, however,
    disclosed to the appellant before it was required to deliver its pleading. The
    motion judge found on that basis that there was no prejudice caused to anyone from
    the delay in disclosing the agreement.  We agree that there was no prejudice. However, in our view the matter
    does not end there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not endorse the practice whereby such agreements
    are concluded between or among various parties to the litigation and are not
    immediately disclosed.  While it is open
    to parties to enter into such agreements, the obligation upon entering such an
    agreement is to <i>immediately</i> inform
    all other parties to the litigation as well as to the court.  As this court said in <i>Laudon v. Roberts</i> (2009), 308 D.L.R. (4th) 422, at para. 39: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The existence of a [“Mary Carter” agreement] significantly
    alters the relationship among the parties to the litigation.  Usually the position of the parties will have
    changed from those set out in their pleadings.  It is for this reason that the existence of such an agreement is to be
    disclosed, as soon as it is concluded, to the court and to the other parties to
    the litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The reason for this is obvious. Such
    agreements change entirely the landscape of the litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the agreement was not voluntarily
    produced immediately upon its completion. It was only produced several months
    after its existence was discovered by the appellant and it was specifically
    requested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other parties to the litigation are not required to
    make inquiries to seek out such agreements. The obligation is that of the
    parties who enter such agreements to immediately disclose the fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the absence of prejudice does not excuse the late
    disclosure of this agreement. The obligation of immediate disclosure is clear
    and unequivocal.  It is not optional. Any
    failure of compliance amounts to abuse of process and must result in
    consequences of the most serious nature for the defaulting party.  Where, as here, the failure amounts to abuse
    of process, the only remedy to redress the wrong is to stay the Third Party
    proceedings and of course, by necessary implication, the Fourth Party
    proceedings commenced at the instance of the Third Party. Only by imposing
    consequences of the most serious nature on the defaulting party is the court
    able to enforce and control its own process and ensure that justice is done
    between and among the parties.  To permit
    the litigation to proceed without disclosure of agreements such as the one in
    issue renders the process a sham and amounts to a failure of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is allowed. The order of
    the motion judge is set aside and in its place an order will issue staying the
    Third Party proceedings and the Fourth Party proceedings against the
    appellant.  The appellant is entitled to
    its costs of the appeal fixed in the sum of $27,500 inclusive of disbursements
    and applicable taxes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is also entitled to its costs before the
    motion judge in the agreed sum of $41,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, because the Third and Fourth Party
    proceedings are now stayed, those parties will be entitled to their costs of
    the action. If the parties are unable to agree on the quantum of costs, that
    amount should be assessed.</p>
