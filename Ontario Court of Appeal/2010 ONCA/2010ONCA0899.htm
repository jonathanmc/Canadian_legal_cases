  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Rosenberg J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a review directed pursuant to s. 680 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> from the decision of Gage
    J. made on November 12, 2008 ordering that the applicant be detained pending
    his trial on charges of second degree murder and attempted murder.  At the time he was charged, the applicant was
    16 years of age, had no prior youth record, and was considered a good
    student.  The application judge ordered
    that the applicant be detained solely on the basis of the tertiary ground set
    out in s. 515(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>holding that detention was necessary to maintain confidence in the
    administration of justice.  This
    application presents the difficult issue of the relationship between the
    principles set out in the <i>Youth Criminal
    Justice Act</i> (the “Act”) and the bail provisions of the <i>Criminal Code.  </i>The
    application also involves consideration of s. 31 of the Act.  That section uses mandatory language and
    requires that, where a judge has determined that detention of a youth is
    necessary under s. 515 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    the judge must consider releasing the young person into the care of a
    “responsible person” as an alternative to detention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would allow the
    application and order that the applicant be released into the care of a
    responsible person in accordance with s. 31 of the Act.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Basic Chronology</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant is charged with second degree murder and
    attempted murder in relation to two stabbings that occurred in the early
    morning hours of  October 12, 2008.  He was arrested on October 17, 2008. The bail
    hearing was held on November 10, 2008 and the applicant was ordered detained on
    November 12, 2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A preliminary inquiry was held over eight days before
    Kastner J., beginning on September 22, 2009.  She gave her reasons ordering that the applicant stand trial on the two
    charges on October 16, 2009.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant initially brought an application in
    October 2009, pursuant to s. 680 of the <i>Criminal
    Code,</i> seeking a direction that the order for detention be reviewed by this
    court.  That application was adjourned so
    that the applicant could obtain a transcript of the preliminary inquiry.  In June 2010, the applicant renewed his
    application for a direction under s. 680.  However, that application did not proceed because the applicant changed
    trial counsel and experienced, we were told, issues with legal aid.  The applicant’s trial was scheduled to begin
    in November of this year but has now been adjourned at the applicant’s request
    until June 2011.  In the result, the
    applicant has been held in custody for over two years.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Evidence at the Bail Hearing </span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Facts alleged by the
    Crown</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the bail hearing, Constable William Ford, of the
    Peel Regional Police, outlined the allegations in the prosecution’s case as it
    was known in November 2008.  On the
    evening of October 11, 2008, there was a birthday party held for two young
    women in a community room of an apartment building in Mississauga. The party
    was chaperoned by adults, DJs provided entertainment, and no alcohol was
    served.  The party was to be a “black and
    white” affair, meaning that none of the attendees were to wear gang
    colours.  Guests were asked to leave at
    midnight. The applicant was a member of a dance troupe that performed at the
    party. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the party, there was a verbal confrontation
    outside between one guest, N.K., and a small group of individuals, over the
    fact that N.K. was wearing a red baseball hat and carrying a red bandanna.  N.K. was told something to the effect of “This
    is a blue block, you can’t fly that flag here”.  According to Constable Ford, red attire is
    associated with the Bloods street gang; “blue block” refers to an area that is
    dominated by the <span class=SpellE>Crips</span> street gang; the Bloods and <span
class=SpellE>Crips</span> are rival gangs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The disagreement spilled out onto the parking lot of
    the apartment complex.  N.K. was followed
    by several males who demanded he “give up his flag” (meaning the red bandanna).
     N.K. had attended the party with three
    other young people, including Nicole L. and Jessica P., (sister of the deceased),
    and who were close to him in proximity when this occurred.  N.K. surrendered his bandanna at which time it
    was lit on fire.  He then attempted to
    leave the area, but he was followed by the group and then punched by a member
    of the group. At this point, Ms. L. stepped in and tried to stop the assault.  She was face to face with a male she described
    as between 5’ and 5’2” in height with a slight build, and a short Mohawk, with
    the sides of his head shaved low and designs cut into them.  The police allege that this person is the
    applicant.  The applicant pushed Ms. L.,
    uttering something similar to “get out of my face”.  She received two scratches on her chest and
    neck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around this time, Michael S. arrived at the scene of
    the altercation.  He had been called by
    friends to attend and offer assistance.  Mr. S. saw the assault on Ms. L. and attempted to come to her
    assistance.  He was then “swarmed” by a
    group that included the applicant and two other members of the dance troupe.  The applicant told the other males to get out
    of the way.  He then took a knife from
    his waist area and plunged the knife several times into Mr. S.’s upper body,
    who then collapsed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The deceased had also been contacted by friends and was
    now in the vicinity as well.  He noticed
    what had happened to his friend, Mr. S. and he attempted to come to his aid.  He was also confronted by the group of males.
    The applicant approached the deceased, and stabbed him in the left side of his
    chest once. The deceased immediately collapsed, and the group of males,
    including the applicant, left the area on foot, and then took a vehicle to the
    home of one of the members of the group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant was arrested on October 17, 2008, as he
    came out of school. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three eyewitnesses gave video statements the night of
    the incident, and several witnesses gave statements in the days following the
    incident.  Constable Ford testified that
    in total, there were approximately 20 individuals involved in the altercation, including
    three to six individuals assaulting Mr. S. and the deceased, and others
    observing.  About seven to ten witnesses
    gave detailed descriptions of the build-up to the confrontation, the
    confrontation itself, and the assaults. Certain of these witnesses knew the
    applicant and had attended the party; some identified the applicant as the
    killer. There were no photo line-ups.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable Ford testified that there was no evidence
    that the applicant was affiliated with the <span class=SpellE>Crips</span>.  He was questioned by the defence about a
    person called “Rich Boy”, who had also been identified as the stabber.  Constable Ford testified that the police were
    attempting to locate Rich Boy to speak to him, but that they were confident
    that the applicant was responsible for the killing.  On re-examination, Constable Ford explained
    that they had eliminated Rich Boy as a suspect because the eyewitnesses had
    clearly described the stabber as the applicant, the people who identified Rich
    Boy were not all at the scene, and a lot of the “evidence” about Rich Boy’s
    involvement had been through word of mouth and gossip.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On re-examination, Constable Ford stated that he was
    aware that there was one other person at the scene who also had a Mohawk
    haircut.  However, that individual was
    described as being 5’8” to 5’9” in height, while the applicant was considerably
    shorter, described as being between 4’11” and 5’2” in height.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Evidence lead by
    applicant</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant called his mother, paternal grandparents,
    and his aunt to testify.  All four were
    prepared to be sureties for the applicant.  The applicant’s mother lives in Mississauga with her father, the
    applicant, and two other sons aged six and three. She is a transit employee and
    does split-shift work. She was in the position to post $15,000 bail for the
    applicant. She had discussions with the applicant’s paternal grandparents about
    a plan of supervision, whereby he would live with them in Brampton. She agreed
    that if the applicant was released from custody, she would make sure that he
    attends court when required and stays out of trouble.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant’s mother testified that he was in grade
    eleven, and a very good student with a part-time job at McDonald’s. She
    described him as a responsible young man who looked after his younger brothers.
    She testified that the applicant never caused her any problems and that he was
    a passive and quiet person.  He played
    basketball in and outside school and took part in a dance troupe.  She considered the applicant’s participation
    in the dance troupe as a positive thing, and commented that she had met most of
    the members of the dance troupe, describing them as nice children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other sureties called were the applicant’s
    grandmother, N.R., his aunt, Z.G., and his grandfather, S.R.. They all live
    together, with the aunt’s daughter, son and granddaughter, in a 3-bedroom house
    in Brampton. The grandparents were willing to post $30,000 bail, and the aunt a
    further $5,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both grandparents had been in a car accident in late
    2007 and had not returned to work at the time of the bail hearing. They could
    not be sure of when they would go back to work. They are evangelists, and go to
    church Friday evenings and Sunday mornings and evenings. There are times that
    they go to church-related conferences outside of Brampton. The applicant’s aunt
    works a 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. job but has some flexibility in her work
    schedule. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each surety expressed that they had no issues working
    together and with his mother to ensure that the applicant is under constant
    supervision and attend his court appearances. Each also testified that they
    would not have a problem with contacting police, should the applicant breach
    bail conditions. Each described the applicant as being responsible, non-violent,
    and well behaved.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Reasons of the Application Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge gave lengthy and careful
    reasons.  He agreed with the Crown’s
    position that the applicant had satisfied the primary ground concerns (<i>Criminal Code</i> s. 515(10)(a)).  That is, it was not necessary to detain the
    applicant to ensure his attendance in court.  The application judge found that secondary ground concerns (<i>Criminal Code</i> s. 515(10)(b)) were also
    met.  He was satisfied that the
    applicant’s antecedents did not support the inference that there was any
    likelihood that he would commit further offences or interfere with the
    administration of justice if released.  I
    agree with that finding and it was not contested by Crown counsel before this
    court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge, however, found that the
    applicant had not satisfied the tertiary ground and that his detention was
    necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.  The application judge reviewed at length the
    principles that guide consideration of s. 515(10)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, especially as the
    provision might apply to young persons.  He then explained why detention was necessary by reference to the four
    factors enumerated in s. 515(10)(c): strength of the Crown’s case, gravity of
    the offences, circumstances of the commission of the offences, and the potential
    for a lengthy term of imprisonment.  He
    also considered other circumstances and particularly the applicant’s age, lack
    of criminal history, and the possible impact of a lengthy period of
    incarceration.  There was little dispute
    about most of these factors.  The
    application judge placed particular emphasis on the apparent strength of the
    prosecution’s case.  As he said at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 42 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In summary Detective Ford is confident that the
    evidence will demonstrate that [the applicant] assaulted [Ms. L.], that [he] assaulted
    [Mr. S.], that [he] produced a knife from his pocket or waistband and that [he]
    stabbed [Mr. S.] and [the deceased]. Relying upon these propositions and this
    characterization as advanced through the evidence of Detective Ford I am driven
    to the conclusion that the case for the prosecution must be properly described
    as strong. <i>The apparent strength of the
    Crown’s case therefore militates forcefully in favour of detention on the
    tertiary ground</i>. Obviously to the extent that any of these propositions is
    flawed my assessment of the strength of the Crown’s case will likewise be flawed.  I pray that they are not because if they are
    flawed and the allegations cannot be proven [the applicant], who is in my judgment
    an otherwise suitable candidate for release, will have been irretrievably harmed
    in aid of preserving the repute of the administration of the justice.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge did not consider whether the
    applicant could be released into the care of a responsible person in accordance
    with s. 31 of the Act.  In fairness to
    the application judge, it does not appear that defence counsel, not Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span> or Mr. Kwok, relied upon s. 31.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Standard of Review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this application, the standard of
    review is adequately set out in <i>R. v.
    West</i>, [1973] 1 O.R. 211 (C.A.).  As
    indicated at p. 217  of the reasons for
    decision in that case, the s. 680 review takes the general form of an ordinary
    appeal.  Thus, this court can intervene
    at least on errors of law and principle.  The court can also grant leave to either party to produce new evidence
    where appropriate.  In this case, the
    fresh evidence relates solely to the question of the strength of the Crown’s
    case and, in particular, evidence concerning the continuing police
    investigation and the evidence led at the preliminary inquiry.  I would admit that evidence.  The evidence was not available at the
    original bail hearing, it is relevant and credible, and it could have affected
    the result.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    application raises four issues. First, whether the application judge erred in
    law in failing to consider the application of s. 31 of the Act where detention
    is otherwise justified on the tertiary ground. Second, the scope of the
    application of the tertiary ground to young persons. Third, whether there has
    been a material change in circumstances, principally as a result of the
    evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. And, fourth, whether the applicant
    should be released.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Section 31 Issue</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 31 of the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act</i> deals with the placement of young persons, who would
    otherwise be detained in custody, in the care of a responsible person.  The provision is unique to the treatment of
    young persons and implements some of the principles set out in s. 3 of the Act,
    including: s. 3(1)(a)(<span class=SpellE>i</span>), addressing the
    circumstances underlying a young person’s offending behaviour; s. 3(1)(a)(ii),
    the emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration; s. 3(1)(b)(<span
class=SpellE>i</span>), a separate system for young <span class=SpellE>persons</span> that emphasizes rehabilitation and reintegration; s. 3(1)(b)(ii), recognition
    of the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced level of maturity;
    and s. 3(1)(b)(iii), enhanced procedural protections to ensure fair
    treatment.  Section 31 is not, however,
    unique to the treatment of young <span class=SpellE>persons</span> alleged to
    have committed criminal offences.  A
    similarly worded provision was added to the former <i>Young Offenders Act </i>in 1986 as s.&nbsp;7.1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have set out s. 31 in full in Appendix “A” to these
    reasons.  The basic scheme of the
    legislation can be summarized as follows.  A young person may be placed in the care of a responsible person instead
    of being detained in custody if the young person would, but for this provision,
    be detained in custody under s. 515 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>; the responsible person is willing and able to take care of and
    exercise control over the young person; and the young person is willing to be
    placed into the care of the responsible person.  Both the responsible person and the young person must sign
    undertakings.  The responsible person
    undertakes to take care of, and be responsible for, the young person attending
    court and complying with other conditions specified by the judge.  The young person undertakes to comply with
    the arrangement and with any other conditions specified by the judge.  Importantly, in situations like this, where
    the young person would, in the absence of a responsible person, be detained in
    custody, the judge is required to inquire as to the availability of a responsible
    person and whether the young person is willing to be placed in that person’s
    care.  Finally, wilful breach of the
    undertaking by either the responsible person or the young person is an offence
    under       s. 139 of the Act and punishable by up to two
    years imprisonment.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The Legislative
    History Argument</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case concerns the interplay between s. 31 of the
    Act and the grounds for detention set out in s. 515(10) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  Particularly, it concerns the so-called
    tertiary ground: detention to maintain confidence in the administration of
    justice.  Crown counsel submits on this
    application that Parliament could not have had the tertiary ground in mind when
    it first enacted s. 7.1, the predecessor to s. 31, as part of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>, since the tertiary
    ground was not added to the <i>Criminal Code</i> until after the <i>Young Offenders Act </i>was
    already in force<i>.  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the legislative history does not support
    this submission.  When s. 7.1 was added
    to the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>, s.
    515(10)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>allowed
    for detention of an accused “on the secondary ground … that his detention is <i>necessary in the public interest</i> or for
    the protection or safety of the public” (emphasis added).  In <i>R.
    v. Morales</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 711, the Supreme Court struck down the “public
    interest” ground for detention because it authorized detention in terms that
    were too vague and imprecise as to meet the constitutional standard for bail <span
class=SpellE>as</span> set out in s. 11(e) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  Section 515(10) was re-enacted in an attempt
    to comply with <i>R. v. Morales</i> by
    adding the predecessor to subparagraph (10)(c):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>c</i>) <i>on any other just cause being shown and,
    without limiting the generality of the foregoing,</i> where the detention is
    necessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice,
    having regard to all the circumstances, including the apparent strength of the
    prosecution's case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances
    surrounding its commission and the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Hall</i>,
    [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, the court upheld what is now referred to as the tertiary
    ground, except that it held that the phrase “on any other just cause being
    shown and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing” violated ss. 7 and
    11(e) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The present version of s. 515(10)(c) is similar
    in most respects to the provision considered in <i>Hall</i>, except for the removal of that phrase.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this legislative history shows, some type of public
    interest ground—beyond detention to ensure attendance at court or to protect
    the public—has always been part of the modern bail regime.  See, for example, the cases referred to by
    Lamer C.J. in <i>R. v. Morales</i> at pp.
    730-31, some of which defined “public interest” in terms not unlike the current
    s. 515(10)(c) as the need to maintain public confidence in the administration
    of justice, in particular, <i>R. v. Dakin, </i>[1989]
    O.J. No. 1348 (C.A.).  See also the
    discussion in Trotter, <i>The Law of Bail in
    Canada, </i>3<sup>rd</sup> ed.<i> </i>(Toronto:
    Carswell) at s. 3.4(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislative history reveals two further important
    facts.  First, s. 7.1 of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i> provided less
    direction than does s. 31 of the <i>Act.  </i>Section 7.1 merely provided that a young
    person “may” be placed in the care of a responsible person.  Section 31, on the other hand, provides that
    the judge “shall inquire” as to the availability of a responsible person, if in
    the absence of a responsible person, the young person would be detained in custody.  Second, under s. 7.2 of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>, a person who
    wilfully failed to comply with an undertaking under s. 7.1. was guilty of a
    summary conviction offence and liable to a maximum penalty of six months
    imprisonment.  Under s. 139 of the Act, a
    person who wilfully fails to comply with an undertaking given under s. 31 is
    guilty of a hybrid offence, which, if prosecuted by indictment, carries a
    maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These changes were intended to enhance use of the
    responsible person option and thereby reduce resort to pre-trial detention for accused
    youth.  In the <i>YCJA Explained, </i>under the explanatory text dealing with the “Care
    of a Responsible Person” the federal government explained the reason for the changes
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under subsection 31(2), a new provision created in
    the <i>YCJA</i>, the court must inquire whether a responsible person is
    available and the young person is willing to be placed. <i>Experience under the </i>YOA<i> indicates that the responsible person
    provision is not used very often. For example, in a study of 118 bail hearings,
    the possibility of a using a responsible person as an alternative to detention
    was not even raised.<a name=rr07></a> Requiring the court to inquire as to
    whether a responsible person is available will ensure that the possibility of
    this alternative to detention is brought to the attention of the defence
    counsel, the young person, the parents, and the prosecutor. This requirement
    also highlights a major objective of the </i>YCJA<i> — the reduction in
    the incarceration of youth by using less restrictive alternatives.</i>  [Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The study referred to in this excerpt is by Kimberley
    N. <span class=SpellE>Varma</span>: “Exploring ‘youth’ in court: An Analysis of
    decision-making in youth court bail hearings” (2002), 44 Can. J. Crim. 143.  The author conducted a study of 118 youth bail cases in four Toronto
    court locations in 1997 when the <i>Young
    Offenders Act</i> was the governing legislation.  The responsible person provision in s. 7.1
    was never mentioned: see p. 159.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it would be ironic if s. 31 were unavailable
    in the very types of cases where pre-trial custody could have the greatest
    negative impact on the young person.  The
    tertiary ground will be invoked most often in murder cases and other very
    serious cases.  Those cases tend to take
    much longer to come to trial, meaning that the young person may be in custody,
    away from parental and other family support, for years during a critical time
    in their development.  To fail to
    recognize the applicability of s. 31 in such cases would undermine the
    principles of reintegration and the need to recognize the greater dependency
    and reduced level of maturity of young persons.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The Abrogation
    Argument</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the legislative history argument, it was
    Crown counsel’s submission on the interplay between s. 515(10)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and s. 31 of the Act, that
    the latter is directed solely to considerations involving the primary and
    secondary grounds.  In effect, Parliament
    had in mind cases where a young person would otherwise be detained for want of
    a suitable surety to ensure attendance at court or to prevent commission of
    further offences.  Thus, the purpose of
    s. 31 was to provide an alternative regime, the written undertaking of a responsible
    person, where a surety was not available.  The monetary pull of a surety bail as contemplated by s. 515(2)(c) and
    s. 771 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>is
    replaced by the criminal sanction under s. 139(1) of the <i>Act, </i>which makes it an offence to wilfully fail to comply with an
    undertaking entered into under      s.
    31.  Crown counsel submits that
    recognizing a role for s. 31 in tertiary ground cases would “have the effect of
    abrogating the tertiary ground with respect to young <span class=SpellE>persons</span>”
    and that s. 31 would “do nothing to assuage the concerns addressed by the
    tertiary ground”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept these submissions.  Section 31 requires that the judge consider
    whether the young person should be released into the care of a responsible
    person; the section does not require a release to a responsible person in every
    case and there will be cases where public confidence will not be satisfied by
    such an order.  As Kennedy J. said in <i>R v. N.W.</i> (2008), 279 Nfld. &amp;
    P.E.I.R. 131 (N.L. Prov. Ct.) at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 126:  “Although there is a mandate to inquire, the
    final discretion whether to place that young person with a responsible person
    is discretionary under section 31(1).”  See
    also, <i>R. v. S.(R.)</i> 2005 <span
class=SpellE>CarswellOnt</span> 2011 (Sup. Ct.) at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    16.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do agree with Crown counsel that the s. 31
    responsible person regime resembles the surety regime and in many respects is
    directed to the same considerations, that is, to ensure the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> good conduct and that the accused attends court as required.  Thus, it may be that resort will be had to s.
    31 more often where the reason for the detention would concern the primary or
    secondary ground.  In this respect, see <i>R. v. J.W.</i> (unreported Ont. S.C.J.
    released May 7, 2010).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, however, s. 31 is not wholly spent by
    primary and secondary ground considerations.    I say that because, as Trotter
    J. points out at s. 6.4, an order under s. 31 is “an <i>alternative</i> to custody” and while the responsible person regime
    “closely resembles the traditional surety relationship … s. 31 contemplates a
    closer level of supervision than is expected of [a] surety”.  As he says, the responsible person is
    expected to “take care of” the young person.  Similarly, the authors of <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act Manual</i><b> </b>point
    out, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 31:00000, that “[t]he statutory
    requirements imposed upon a responsible person are considerably greater than
    the obligations imposed upon a surety”:  Peter J. Harris &amp; Miriam H. Bloomenfeld, <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act Manual</i>, loose-leaf (Aurora: Canada Law
    Book, 2005-).   Where a parent is simply named
    as a surety for a young person, the parent will in addition to their surety
    duties take care of the young person, but this is because of duties imposed by
    law outside of the bail regime.  The s.
    31 responsible person has the duty to take care of the young person not because
    of other common law or statutory duties but because of the written undertaking
    reinforced by the penal consequences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the closer level of supervision
    contemplated under s. 31, together with the penal sanction for both the young
    person and the responsible person, may in some circumstances meet the public
    confidence concerns of the tertiary ground.  At <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.  26 and 31 of <i>R. v. Hall</i>, <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> C.J. explained the
    purpose of the tertiary ground:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, Parliament provided for denial of bail
    where <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of s. 515(10)
    are not met but the judge, viewing the situation objectively through the lens
    of the four factors stipulated by Parliament, has decided that there is
    &quot;just cause&quot; for refusing bail. <i>To
    allow an accused to be released into the community on bail in the face of a
    heinous crime and overwhelming evidence may erode the public's confidence in
    the administration of justice</i>. Where justice is not seen to be done by the
    public, confidence in the bail system and, more generally, the entire justice
    system may falter. When the public's confidence has reasonably been called into
    question, dangers such as public unrest and vigilantism may emerge. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>It serves a
    very real need to permit a bail judge to detain an accused pending trial for
    the purpose of maintaining the public's confidence if the circumstances of the
    case so warrant</i>. Without public confidence, the bail system and the justice
    system generally stand compromised. While the circumstances in which recourse
    to this ground for bail denial may not arise frequently, when they do it is
    essential that a means of denying bail be available.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an appropriate case, a judge considering the case of
    a young person charged with a very serious offence may find that public
    confidence in the bail system, and the justice system generally, can be
    maintained through the rigorous and strict regime that is possible under s. 31.  While “release into the community” of an
    adult alleged to have committed the heinous crime referred to in <i>Hall </i>may not maintain confidence in the
    bail and justice systems, release of a young person to the close care of a
    responsible person may not undermine public confidence.  In other words, as a result of s. 31, the
    judge is not faced with a simple binary choice of detention or release into the
    community.  Section&nbsp;31 gives a
    further option that may in some respects resemble a form of detention by
    imposing strict conditions both on the young person and the responsible
    person.  Those conditions could include a
    form of house arrest and other stringent conditions that keep the young person
    out of detention but under the close supervision and care of a responsible
    person who faces penal sanctions for failing to live up to the solemn
    responsibilities imposed by the undertaking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 31 contributes to achieving the broader purpose
    of the Act, referred to earlier, to reduce reliance on incarceration for young <span
class=SpellE>persons</span> at all stages of proceedings and to give the youth
    court alternatives to imprisonment. In that respect, I agree with the comments
    of De Filippis J. in <i>R. v. A.(S.),</i> 2004 ONCJ 184, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 10 as to the purpose of s.
    31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Parliament has
    directed judges not to incarcerate young people pending trial unless it is
    absolutely necessary or to put it another way, unless there is no other alternative
    available to the court and that, in my opinion simply mirrors Parliament's
    direction in the <i>Youth Criminal Justice
    Act </i>as to what should be done with young people who are found guilty after
    trial. Those provisions are also loud and clear and they direct judges to
    incarcerate young <span class=SpellE>persons</span> only as a last resort,
    subject to obvious exceptions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To a similar effect are the comments of Pickup J. in <i>R v. R.N.C</i>. (2007), N.S.R. (2d) 200 (S.C.)
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 46, that s. 31(1) is obviously an illustration
    of the general principle in the Act that “incarceration should be a last
    resort”.  See also <i>R. v. J.D</i>., 2005 ONCJ 49, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 57.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Crown counsel’s submission is inconsistent
    with the important direction in s. 3(2) of the Act, that the Act be liberally
    construed to ensure that young persons are dealt with in accordance with the
    principles in s. 3(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There has been little judicial treatment of the
    relationship of s. 31 and the tertiary ground.  One of the most helpful decisions is by <span class=SpellE>Huddart</span>&nbsp;J.A.
    considering the predecessor provision, s. 7.1 of the <i>Young Offenders Act,</i> in <i>R. v.
    K.M.E.</i> (1998), 105 B.C.A.C. 151.  She
    held that an order could be made under s.&nbsp;7.1 even where the young person
    would otherwise be detained on the tertiary ground.  <span class=SpellE>Huddart</span> J.A. was
    dealing with a notorious murder allegedly committed by a group of young people
    (see <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Ellard</span></i>,
    [2009] 2 S.C.R. 19).  The young person
    was, however, only 15 years of age and had no prior criminal record.  <span class=SpellE>Huddart</span> J.A.
    reasoned as follows at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 16 and 19 in
    considering the interplay between s. 7.1 and public confidence in the bail
    system:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As is apparent from the portion of the Youth Court
    judge's reasons I quoted earlier, the Youth Court judge appears to have
    considered placement with parents as a &quot;form of release&quot; that would
    erode &quot;the respect and confidence of the public&quot; for the court
    system. On the basis of the evidence before this court, I do not agree with
    that assessment. I consider that a well-informed member of the public would not
    be troubled by a decision to place a 15-year old girl with her parents pending
    trial, even one for murder. <i>The public
    perception of the crime is a factor to be considered if confidence in the
    administration of criminal justice is to be maintained, but so is the public
    perception of the alleged offender, who is presumed innocent, and so are the
    principles Parliament requires to be considered in the interpretation and
    application of the </i>Young Offenders Act<i>.
    The ability of a young person's family to supervise the young person must be
    considered before detention in custody is ordered</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is to be recalled that s. 7.1 comes into play
    only upon a finding that a detention order is justified. If the public interest
    does not demand that a young person be detained, a court might well release
    that young person on the condition that she live with her parents, but it would
    not be required to make an order under s. 7.1 and formal undertakings would not
    be required of the parents.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, <span class=SpellE>Huddart</span> J.A.
    ordered the young person’s release under the control of her father with both
    her father and mother to act as sureties.  I agree with the comments of <span class=SpellE>Huddart</span> J.A.  Section 31, in my view, is available even if
    the young person would otherwise be detained on the tertiary ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, some points about procedure.  A strict two-stage procedure in application
    of s. 31 is both artificial and could prove time-consuming.  Accordingly, at the evidence stage of the
    bail hearing, in a case where s. 31 may be in play, counsel should canvass with
    proposed sureties their suitability to also act as responsible persons, should
    the court so order.  In addition, since
    the s. 31 inquiry is mandatory, where detention is a real possibility, the
    judge or justice has an obligation to raise the issue with counsel.  See Mara Green et.al., <i>Annotated Youth Criminal Justice Act Service</i>, loose-leaf (Markham:
    Lexis Nexis Canada, 2003) notes to s. 31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude, the application judge, having decided to
    detain the applicant, erred in law in failing to consider whether the applicant
    could be released into the care of a responsible person.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Tertiary Ground and Young Persons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of his reasons, the application judge
    noted that the tertiary ground is to be used sparingly as a basis for refusing
    release pending trial.  He reasoned that
    given the strong preference for non-custodial dispositions in the Act, “the
    tertiary ground to justify the pre-trial detention of a youth should be even
    rarer”.  The rationale favouring release
    pending trial for youths is strongest where detention is sought on the secondary
    ground: see s. 29(2) of the Act.  While I
    agree with the principle that the tertiary ground will rarely justify detention
    of a youth, I reach that conclusion for slightly different reasons in the case
    of a youth charged with murder.  Accepting the Act’s preference for non-custodial disposition, that
    rationale carries less weight in a case of a youth charged with murder.  If sentenced as a young offender for second
    degree murder, a 16-year-old, like the applicant, is subject to a maximum
    sentence of seven years including four years of custody:  Act s. 42(2)(q)(ii).  If given an adult sentence, a 16-year-old is
    to be sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for a
    period of 7 years: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s.
    745.1(c).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are, however, other provisions of the Act that
    demonstrate a preference for release pending trial and thus detention on any
    basis, including the tertiary ground, only in rare circumstances.  Most important are the principles briefly
    mentioned and set out in s. 3 and in particular the principle of a separate
    criminal justice system for young <span class=SpellE>persons</span> emphasizing
    rehabilitation and reintegration, accountability consistent with the greater
    dependency of young persons and their reduced level of maturity, and enhanced
    procedural protections.  These principles
    signal that it will be rare that detention of a young person will be required
    to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system and the bail system.  Added to this is the special direction in s.
    31 that requires consideration of placement with a responsible person even
    where detention, including detention on the tertiary ground, would otherwise be
    justified under s. 515 of the <i>Criminal
    Code.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the tertiary ground generally, its application is
    governed by the principle that detention is “necessary” to maintain confidence
    in the administration of justice having regard to all the circumstances and in
    particular the four listed factors set out in s. 515(10)(c):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) the apparent strength
    of the prosecution’s case,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) the gravity of the offence,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) the circumstances surrounding the commission
    of the offence, including whether a firearm was used, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv) the fact that the
    accused is liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of
    imprisonment or, in the case of an offence that involves, or whose
    subject-matter is, a firearm, a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term
    of three years or more.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beginning with <i>Hall</i>,
    courts considering the tertiary ground have held that it is to be used
    sparingly.  This is hardly surprising
    given the fact that it is invoked only where the accused has already been
    considered a suitable candidate for release on the usual considerations of
    attendance in court and likelihood of commission of further offences.  After adopting, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    27, a statement from an earlier case that detention is justified on the
    tertiary ground only in “relatively rare” cases, <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> C.J. said, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 31 of <i>Hall:</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>While the circumstances in which recourse to this ground for bail
    denial may not arise frequently</i>, when they do it is essential that a means
    of denying bail be available.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary to review at length the various ways
    in which courts since <i>Hall</i> have
    attempted to implement this principle of sparing use of the tertiary ground.  Application of this principle has proved most
    problematic in murder cases because such cases by definition meet the second
    and fourth criteria set out in s. 515(10)(c), gravity of the offence and
    potential liability to a lengthy prison term.  Thus, application of the tertiary ground in murder cases will turn on
    the apparent strength of the Crown’s case and the circumstances surrounding the
    commission of the offence.  As to the
    latter factor, some courts have employed the idea of “something more” than the
    fact of the killing.  The “something
    more” language originates in a helpful pre-<i>Hall </i>decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, in <i>R. v. Blind</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 87. Jackson&nbsp;J.A. said, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 13, that it is not enough that the crime is extremely
    grave, that there is potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment and that the
    offence has the features of any violent crime – “More is required.”  The idea of something more is consistent with <i>Hall</i> itself where <span class=SpellE>McLachlin</span> C.J. referred to the high level of concern in the community and the horrific
    nature of the crime.  In <i>Hall,</i> the accused was charged with first
    degree murder of a relative.  The
    perpetrator had slashed the victim 37 times and attempted to cut her head off.  The “something more” language has been picked
    up by Cronk J.A. of this court in <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>LaFramboise</span></i> (2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 492.  Yet even where the circumstances of the
    offence are particularly egregious, as they were in <span class=SpellE><i>LaFramboise</i></span>, other factors may be
    consistent with release because, as in <span class=SpellE><i>LaFramboise</i></span><i>,</i> the
    Crown’s case was not particularly strong and the accused had limited
    involvement in the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It must be recognized, however, that the “something
    more” language is simply a way of emphasizing the need for sparing use of the
    tertiary ground as a basis for detention.  The tertiary ground is not limited to what a court can imagine to be the
    most heinous of offences and can be invoked where the circumstances fall short
    of the horror and community concern noted in <i>Hall</i>:  see <i>R. v. S. (B.)</i> (2007), 49 C.R. (6<sup>th</sup>)
    397 (Ont. C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 8 - 10; <i>R. v. Stevenson, </i>2007 ONCA 378; <i>R. v. Oliver</i>, 2008 NLCA 27;   <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Mordue</span></i> (2006), 223 C.C.C. (3d) 407 (Ont. C.A.) at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The grounds enumerated in s. 515(10)(c), do not exhaust
    the factors the court must consider where the Crown seeks to rely upon the
    tertiary ground.  That paragraph directs
    the court to consider “all the circumstances” including the enumerated factors.  All the circumstances may, in appropriate
    cases, include the personal circumstances of the accused.  Public perception about a bail decision
    cannot help but be influenced by whether, for example, the accused is a mature
    adult with a serious record, as against a young person with no prior record.  See Trotter at s. 3.4(b)(v).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, confidence in the administration of justice
    does not turn only on the circumstances of the offence and the alleged
    offender.  Public confidence is measured
    by the standard of a reasonable member of the community (<i>Hall</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 41) and, in my view,
    includes recognition that bail is granted within a context of constitutional
    guarantees, most especially the presumption of innocence and the right to
    reasonable bail.  In <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Mordue</span></i>, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    27, Juriansz J.A., speaking for the court, referred to the pre-<i>Hall</i> comments of <span class=SpellE>McEachern</span> C.J.B.C. in <i>R. v. Nguyen</i> (1997), 119
    C.C.C. (3d) 269 (B.C.C.A.) at p. 274:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The principle that seems to emerge is that the law
    favours release unless there is some factor or factors that would cause “ordinary
    reasonable, fair-minded members of society” …, or <i>persons informed about the philosophy of the legislative provisions,
    Charter values and the actual circumstances of the case </i>…, to believe that
    detention is necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of
    justice.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law favours release in the context of young
    persons, even those charged with very serious offences, as supported by the
    principles set out in s. 3 of the Act and the principles of fundamental justice
    recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada that relate to young persons.  As <span class=SpellE>Abella</span> J. said
    in <i>R. v. D.B.</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 3, at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What the onus provisions <span class=italic1><span
style='font-style:normal'>do</span></span> engage, in my view, is what flows
    from <span class=italic1><span style='font-style:normal'>why</span></span> we
    have a separate legal and sentencing regime for young people, namely that
    because of their age, young people have heightened vulnerability, less maturity
    and a reduced capacity for moral judgment. This entitles them to a presumption
    of diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability. This presumption is the
    principle at issue here and it is a presumption that has resulted in the entire
    youth sentencing scheme, with its unique approach to punishment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will now turn to the application of these principles
    to the circumstances of this case and also consider whether there has been a
    material change in circumstances since the original bail hearing.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Application to this Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant is charged with second degree murder and
    attempted murder, both grave offences, although not as grave as in <i>Hall</i> where the charge was first degree
    murder.  There is the potential for a
    lengthy period of imprisonment, although if the applicant is sentenced only as
    a youth, given the period of pre-trial detention already, this factor does not
    loom as large as it might if the applicant is sentenced as an adult.  At this stage it is not possible to say what
    would happen if the applicant is convicted.  The potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment on either view favours
    detention.  As to the circumstances
    surrounding the commission of the offence, there are a number of factors that
    give rise to concern.  The killing and
    attempted killing are senseless, unprovoked acts committed on innocent victims
    simply attempting to come to the assistance of their friends. The offences were
    committed in the open in the presence of a large number of other young
    people.  There is an element of gang
    culture about the facts that is disturbing; the encounter having begun with a
    quarrel over gang colours.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant submits that the factor concerning the strength
    of the prosecution’s case now tends to favour his release.  He argues that there has been a material
    change in circumstances.  Counsel for the
    applicant submits that the preliminary inquiry has demonstrated flaws in the
    prosecution’s case that would not have been apparent when the facts were
    presented to the application judge.  Crown counsel submits that there has been little real change in the
    strength of the prosecution’s case.  While some parts of the case may have weakened, other parts have become
    stronger.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the application judge, Constable Ford testified
    in such a way as to leave the impression that witnesses had actually seen the
    applicant stab both victims.  The
    evidence led at the preliminary inquiry is not as clear.  At its highest, the evidence shows that a
    person matching the description of the applicant was seen with a knife before
    entering the crowd of people surrounding the victims.  I agree with Crown counsel that this is not a
    serious change in the strength of the prosecution’s case.  The evidence remains that only one person was
    seen with a knife.  Further, there is a
    compelling body of evidence that this person had a somewhat unique description
    being very short, with a Mohawk haircut, and a pattern shaved into the sides of
    his head.  While the principal Crown
    witness, Ms.&nbsp;L., had never met the applicant before, people who did know
    the applicant place him at the scene and his appearance the night of the
    stabbings matches the description provided by Ms. L.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, this was an identification case and there
    are several aspects of the evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry that
    impact on the strength of the identification evidence.  The first concerns the alternate suspect,
    with the street name Rich Boy.  At the
    bail hearing, Constable Ford testified that while the police had heard that
    some people had identified Rich Boy as the perpetrator, the police had not
    spoken to him and were confident that the applicant was responsible for the
    killing because of the descriptions given.  At the preliminary inquiry, one witness testified that in fact Rich Boy
    was the perpetrator.  A second witness
    testified to seeing Rich Boy fighting with one of the victims and moments later
    seeing that the victim had been stabbed. And, there was evidence that Rich Boy
    was an affiliate of the <span class=SpellE>Crips</span> gang and therefore,
    unlike the applicant, may have had a motive for confronting N.K.  It seems to have been common ground that the perpetrator
    had been part of the group that confronted N.K. about wearing the red bandanna
    in the blue <span class=SpellE>Crips</span> neighbourhood.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is also the evidence led at the preliminary
    inquiry from a witness Ms. T.D. that the person with the knife was wearing a
    dark baseball cap.  As well, N.K. testified
    at the preliminary inquiry that the person who pushed Ms. L. was probably 5’6”
    tall and was wearing a hat.  Ms. L.
    testified that the youth who scratched her was the one she later saw with the
    knife.  One of the two witnesses called
    at the preliminary inquiry who identified Rich Boy as the perpetrator also
    described him as wearing a baseball cap that night.  There does not seem to have been any evidence
    that the applicant was wearing a baseball cap that night and the picture of the
    applicant taken at the party the night of the stabbings does not show him
    wearing a baseball cap.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel points out that the two witnesses who, at
    the preliminary inquiry, identified Rich Boy as the perpetrator, had earlier
    given statements to the police identifying a person with the applicant’s
    description as being part of the group that confronted the victims.  The police have also spoken to Rich Boy’s
    grandmother who provides him with an alibi for at least part of the time when
    the party was going on.  A picture of
    Rich Boy taken several weeks after the stabbings shows a very different
    hairstyle from the Mohawk allegedly worn by the perpetrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the bail hearing, Constable Ford presented the
    summary of the case in a manner that led the application judge to believe that Michael
    S., the victim of the attempted murder, had confronted the applicant and had identified
    the applicant as being part of a group of three men that assaulted him and that
    the applicant then stabbed him.  At the
    preliminary inquiry, Mr. S. stated that he was confused by all of the people
    around him and when he fell down, he wasn’t even aware that he had been stabbed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the bail hearing, Constable Ford said that the
    police had a “very limited description” from Mr. S. that was not different from
    that provided by Ms. L. “just not as detailed”. This statement is not borne out
    by the preliminary inquiry.  Michael S.
    described one person in the crowd of people around him as having his head
    shaved at the side but as being six feet tall, which is somewhat closer in
    height to the description of Rich Boy than the applicant, who is quite
    short.  Admittedly, Michael&nbsp;S. was
    lying on the ground when he saw this person.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, there was evidence at the preliminary inquiry
    of at least two other youths wearing the Mohawk style haircut.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the preliminary inquiry transcript includes
    evidence supporting the view that the applicant was the perpetrator.  But, the preliminary inquiry reveals a
    chaotic scene with witnesses providing varying descriptions of the assailant
    and some evidence to support an alternative suspect.  The application judge was persuaded that the strength
    of the Crown’s case “militates forcefully in favour of detention on the
    tertiary ground”.  In my view, following
    the preliminary inquiry, the Crown’s case can no longer be described in such
    confident terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have indicated, s. 515(10)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>requires the court to have
    regard to all the circumstances.  In my
    view, the applicant’s age and character are part of the circumstances.  He was 16 years of age, had no prior youth
    record, was attending school, and had a good part-time job.  He was involved in extra-curricular sport
    activities and the dance troupe.  Although,
    the incident that sparked these serious offences appears to have been related
    to gang activity, the applicant has no known gang affiliations.  In my view, these are relevant circumstances
    in considering public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude, in my view there are two reasons to
    intervene in this case.  First, the
    application judge erred in principle in failing to consider the application of
    s. 31 of the Act.  Second, there has been
    a change in circumstances in that the preliminary inquiry discloses a prosecution
    case that is not as compelling as the case portrayed at the bail hearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I entirely agree with the application judge that this
    was a case that turned on the tertiary ground.  The evidence at the bail hearing demonstrated that the applicant would
    attend court as required and that his detention was not required for the
    protection or safety of the public.  Although the prosecution case has diminished somewhat it was still a
    relatively strong case.  These were very
    grave offences and, as outlined above, the circumstances surrounding the
    commission of the offences are very troubling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied, however, that although a case was otherwise
    made out for detention on the tertiary ground, this is an appropriate case to
    release the young person pursuant to  s.
    31 of the Act.  A strict regime under s.
    31 would meet public interest concerns and take into account the applicant’s
    prior good character.  Another factor
    favouring release under s. 31, is the length of time that the applicant has
    already been in custody, which somewhat weakens the fourth factor in s.
    515(10)(c) (liability for a lengthy period of imprisonment).  Importantly, as well, the plan of supervision
    and care will require the applicant to reside in a different city than where
    the offences were committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Either of the applicant’s grandmother or grandfather
    would be a suitable responsible person.  Accordingly, I would order that the applicant be released provided that
    either his paternal grandmother or grandfather is prepared to undertake in
    writing to take care of and to be responsible for the attendance of the
    applicant in court when required and to comply with the other conditions that I
    will outline.  The applicant must also be
    prepared to enter into an undertaking to comply with the arrangement and to
    comply with the other conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conditions I would impose as part of the
    undertaking are a form of house arrest, although he will be allowed to attend
    school, and are set out in Appendix “B”.  The applicant will also enter into a recognizance in the amount of
    $50,000 with four sureties to be his mother ($15,000), his aunt ($5,000), and
    his paternal grandparents (jointly $30,000).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of these reasons and given the privacy
    provisions of the Act, I have not disclosed the names of the applicant’s
    grandparents, mother or aunt and the address of the grandparents’ residence.  Counsel should be in touch with the Registrar
    to provide this information so that the recognizance and undertakings can be
    completed.  I would ask the parties to
    discuss whether there is a need for other conditions in the undertakings and
    the recognizance, including whether it is necessary for the applicant to report
    to the police and not to associate with any named persons or class of persons.  If counsel are able to agree on those
    conditions they are to provide them to the court.  If they are unable to agree, they may arrange
    to attend before me to finalize the terms of the undertakings and the
    recognizance.</p>

'>(1) The following principles apply in this Act:</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(a) the youth criminal justice system is intended
    to</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) prevent crime by
    addressing the circumstances underlying a young person’s offending behaviour,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(ii) rehabilitate young persons who commit offences
    and reintegrate them into society, and</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(iii) ensure that a young person is subject to
    meaningful consequences for his or her offence</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>in order to promote the long-term protection of the
    public;</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(b) the criminal justice system for young <span
class=SpellE>persons</span> must be separate from that of adults and emphasize
    the following:</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) rehabilitation and
    reintegration,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(ii) fair and proportionate accountability that is
    consistent with the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced level
    of maturity,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(iii) enhanced procedural protection to ensure that
    young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right
    to privacy, are protected,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(iv) timely intervention that reinforces the link
    between the offending behaviour and its consequences, and</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(v) the promptness and speed with which persons
    responsible for enforcing this Act must act, given young persons’ perception of
    time;</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(c) within the limits of fair and proportionate
    accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences
    should</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) reinforce respect for
    societal values,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(ii) encourage the repair of harm done to victims
    and the community,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(iii) be meaningful for the individual young person
    given his or her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve
    the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in
    the young person’s rehabilitation and reintegration, and</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and
    linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and
    of young persons with special requirements; and</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(d) special considerations apply in respect of
    proceedings against young persons and, in particular,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) young persons have
    rights and freedoms in their own right, such as a right to be heard in the
    course of and to participate in the processes, other than the decision to
    prosecute, that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons have
    special guarantees of their rights and freedoms,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(ii) victims should be treated with courtesy,
    compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the
    minimum degree of inconvenience as a result of their involvement with the youth
    criminal justice system,</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(iii) victims should be provided with information
    about the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate and be heard, and</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

    proceedings involving their children and encouraged to support them in
    addressing their offending behaviour.</span></p>
