  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mary Simonin (Mary) appeals a judgment dismissing her
    unjust enrichment claim, asserted on her own behalf and on behalf of the estate
    of Mary’s deceased husband Franco, against Franco’s mother Matilda Simonin
    (Matilda).  Mary claims that Matilda was
    unjustly enriched as the result of improvements made by Franco to a farm which
    Matilda owned, but on which Mary, Franco and their children lived from 1996
    until shortly after Franco’s death in 2003. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Luigi Simonin, Matilda’s husband and Franco’s father,
    bought the farm with a business partner who was also his brother-in-law.  After Luigi’s death, Matilda acquired the
    partner’s interest and became the sole registered owner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Franco and Mary were married in 1996 and from that time
    lived on the farm, initially in a trailer and then in the farmhouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From 1996 until his accidental death in 2003, Franco
    and his family lived rent-free in the farmhouse, farmed the land and retained
    the profits.  Matilda paid the property
    taxes.  Franco paid the other expenses
    and did extensive renovations to the farm house and farm property.  A will that Matilda executed in 1983 provided
    that if she survived her husband, her estate would be divided equally between
    her children, Franco and Luisa.  Matilda
    testified that she never advised Franco that the property would be left to him,
    nor did she tell him that he could stay on the property indefinitely.  She did, however, state that she intended to
    permit Franco and his family to live on the farm as long as they wanted during
    her lifetime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Six months after Franco’s death, Mary and her children
    moved from the farm. Shortly thereafter, Matilda sold the farm for
    $880,000.  She gave $200,000 to Franco’s
    sister Luisa, and kept the remainder, refusing to give Mary any of the
    proceeds.  Matilda testified that she
    would not have sold the farm had Mary and the children wished to remain there
    after Franco’s untimely death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mary asserts an unjust enrichment claim for the value
    of Franco’s improvements to the farm, found by the trial judge to amount to
    $230,000. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave extensive reasons for judgment
    dismissing the claim for unjust enrichment on the ground that Mary failed to
    meet all three elements of the test for unjust enrichment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, while Matilda was enriched on account of the
    renovations, the trial judge found that those improvements were done not by
    Franco or Mary but by Franco’s company, <span style='color:black'>Spancrest
    Construction Limited (Spancrest). </span> Accordingly, whether in her personal capacity
    or as Franco’s estate trustee, Mary had no claim to be reimbursed for the
    enrichment to <span class=GramE>Matilda.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge found that Franco and Mary had
    received benefits, including living rent-free on the property and deriving
    profits from the operation of the farm, totalling $610,920.52.  As the benefits they had received
    significantly exceeded the value of the improvements, the trial judge found
    that Mary had not established that she and Franco suffered a deprivation
    corresponding to the enrichment conferred on Matilda.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial judge held that Mary had not made out
    a <i>prima facie</i> case that there was no juristic reason for the enrichment
    of the defendant.  He found that Franco
    had done the improvements to the property voluntarily and in his own self
    interest and that this amounted to a recognized juristic reason to permit
    Matilda to retain the benefit conferred.  He also found that as between Franco and
    Matilda, there was no reasonable expectation that Franco would be compensated
    for the cost of the improvements.  He
    found that Matilda never asked Franco to make any improvements to the property,
    that Franco never asked for permission to carry out renovations on the property
    and that there was no agreement, understanding or reasonable expectation as
    between Franco and Matilda that she would repay Franco for the costs of the
    improvements made to the property upon its sale or otherwise.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common ground that to make out a claim for unjust
    enrichment, a plaintiff must show:</p>
  <p>a) <span class=GramE>that</span> the defendant has been
    enriched;</p>
  <p>b) <span class=GramE>that</span> the plaintiff has suffered a
    corresponding deprivation; and</p>
  <p>c) <span class=GramE>that</span> there is no juristic reason
    for the defendant to retain the enrichment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>See <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980, at para. <span class=GramE>3; <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co.,</i> <span
style='color:#3A3A3A'>[2004] 1 S.C.R. 629,</span> at paras.</span> <span
class=GramE>38-41.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mary submits that the trial judge erred with respect to
    all three elements of the test for unjust enrichment and that her claim should
    be allowed or a new trial ordered.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to the specific issues raised by the
    appellant, we note that the trial judge gave detailed and carefully considered
    reasons for judgment rejecting the claim for unjust enrichment.  The trial judge’s findings of fact are
    entitled to deference on appeal. Moreover, this case involves a claim for
    equitable relief in an area that calls for a careful weighing of a variety of
    general factors arising from the conduct of the parties.  Plainly, the judge who conducted this two week
    trial and who heard and saw the parties was best placed to make that
    assessment. In the absence of an error in principle or a palpable and
    overriding error of fact, it is his assessment, not ours, that must govern the
    outcome.</p>
  <h3><i>1. Was
    the respondent enriched?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that Matilda was enriched by the
    improvements. The trial judge’s finding that all the improvements to the farm
    were made or paid for by Franco’s company, Spancrest, is uncontested. While the
    trial judge dealt with that fact under the first branch of the test, in our opinion
    it can best be considered under the second branch, to which we now turn.</p>
  <h3><i>2.
    Did the appellant suffer a corresponding deprivation? </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, there is evidence to support the trial
    judge’s determination that Mary, whether in her personal capacity, or in her
    capacity as estate trustee, did not suffer a corresponding deprivation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first ground arises from the fact that the
    improvements were paid for by Spancrest. Franco appears to have treated Spancrest
    and its assets as being his own personal assets. While he was not paid a
    salary, the company paid many of his personal expenses. Significantly, the
    trial judge accepted the evidence of Franco’s sister, Luisa, who worked for
    Spancrest, that invoices for between 30% and 50% of the cost of the
    improvements were billed to other jobs and paid by Spancrest’s clients.  In other words, Franco used Spancrest to
    cause third parties to bear a significant extent of the cost of the improvements
    that are said to ground the claim for unjust enrichment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept the appellant’s submission that on
    this evidence, the trial judge made an artificial distinction between Franco
    and Spancrest.  Franco took the benefits
    of the corporate form and he used his corporation to funnel payments from third
    parties <span class=GramE>to  pay</span> for a substantial portion of the improvements for which an unjust enrichment
    claim is now asserted.  <span
style='color:black'>In our view, it was open to the trial judge to find on this
    record that while Matilda was enriched, that enrichment was not one for which
    Franco’s estate had a valid claim. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge relied upon a further ground for
    finding that the appellant failed to establish a corresponding deprivation. He
    found that Mary and Franco received benefits from Matilda that more than
    off-set the value of the improvements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by
    off-setting benefits received by Franco from Matilda against the expenditures
    made by Franco to improve the farm. The appellant submits that the trial judge
    should have found the right to live rent-free and to profit from the operation
    of the farm to be outright gifts that preceded and that were unrelated to the
    improvements.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We disagree.  In our view, the trial judge’s treatment of
    the off-setting benefits is supported by the record.  Matilda’s evidence was that while she intended
    to permit Franco and his family to live on the farm as long as they wanted to
    do so during her lifetime, she did not promise or advise Franco that he could
    stay on the property indefinitely.  On
    that evidence, it was open to the trial judge to reject Mary’s submission that
    the right to live rent-free and to profit from the farm should be regarded as
    immediate and unconditional gifts unconnected to the improvements.  See <i>Toth
    v. de Frias</i> (1996), <span style='color:black;'>78
    B.C.A.C. 34, at para. 4: “… </span><span style='color:black'>the learned trial
    judge examined the evidence with care and decided that the plaintiff roughly
    gained as much as she lost in her relationship with the defendant.  That is a fact-based determination which cannot
    be overturned unless it is shown to be plainly wrong.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also submits that this evidence
    should have been dealt with as part of the third branch of the test relating to
    juristic benefit. We need not decide that point as it is our view that wherever
    considered, the off-setting benefits defeat the claim of unjust enrichment. </p>
  <h3><i>3.
    Absence of a juristic reason for the defendant to retain the benefit</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge cited and applied <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co</i>. and <i>Campbell v. Campbell</i> (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 783 (C.A.) with respect
    to the final branch of the test, namely, whether the plaintiff demonstrated
    that there is an absence of a juristic reason for the enrichment of the
    defendant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Garland</i> holds, at para. 44, that “[f]irst, the plaintiff must show that no juristic
    reason from an established category exists to deny recovery”.  <i>Campbell</i> identifies the situation where the&nbsp;plaintiff
    conferred a benefit while acting voluntarily in his own self interest as an
    established category to deny recovery.  There
    was evidence, including the cross-examination of the appellant, to support the
    trial judge’s finding that any benefit conferred to the respondent by Franco
    and Mary as a result of the renovations arose from Franco and Mary acting
    voluntarily and in their own self interest, and that, therefore, there was a
    juristic reason for the respondent to retain the benefit received by her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Campbell</i> also holds, at para. 31, that “what is at the heart of the third
    requirement is the reasonable expectation of the parties, and whether it would
    be just and fair to the parties considering all of the relevant circumstances,
    to permit the recipient of the benefit to retain it without compensation to
    those who provided it.” The appellant submits that Matilda acquiesced in making
    the improvements. The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and concluded
    that Franco and Mary never indicated to Matilda any expectation of compensation
    for the improvements and he accepted Matilda’s evidence that she did not know
    of any agreement, obligation or understanding that she would compensate them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the facts of this case are not on all fours with <i>Campbell, </i>the passage at para. 41 from the judgment of Borins J.A.
    is apposite to this appeal: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At most,
    the only reasonable expectation the respondents could have had of receiving
    some benefit in return for financing the improvements to the farm was the
    continued use of the farm, together with its buildings, equipment and herd, in
    running the dairy operation.&nbsp; The appellant never deprived the respondents
    of this use and did not intend to do so in the future.&nbsp; This reasonable
    expectation was defeated only as a result of the respondents’ own actions in
    deciding to sell the milk quota, which effectively brought the dairy operation
    to an end.&nbsp; In my view, the respondents did not arrive at this decision
    with the expectation that they would obtain some share in the farm in return
    for the improvements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the reasonable expectation that Mary could
    continue to live on the farm following Franco’s death was defeated, not by
    anything done by Matilda, but by Mary’s own decision to leave the farm.  She did not thereby become entitled to obtain
    a share of the proceeds from the farm in return for the improvements she and
    Franco had made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor are we persuaded that the trial judge erred by
    failing to find a reasonable expectation on the basis of the following exchange
    from Matilda’s cross-examination: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And you knew that Franco was investing
    whatever money he had, or the majority of it, into the farm because he wanted
    to live there with his family possibly for the rest of his life?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I was happy for him to stay there as
    much as he wanted.  And then once I, I [sic]
    was gone, then it was up to him and Luisa [his sister, who along with Franco was
    to inherit Matilda’s estate] to settle their things.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Did you understand that Franco was going
    to compensate Luisa for the renovations he put into the house at the farm?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        This I cannot answer.  I don’t know that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Did you think it would have been fair to
    give Luisa half of the value of the improvements to the farm that you knew that
    your son was paying for?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I don’t – I, I [sic] don’t think so
    because they always got along very well and they would have got to some
    agreement without having to argue over things.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the respondent that this passage does not
    show that Matilda conceded that it would be unfair if she did not compensate
    Franco for the improvements. The question posed to Matilda in cross-examination
    was clearly based upon the premise that the full value of the farm, including
    the improvements, was hers to give. Matilda’s answer indicates that she
    regarded the question of any consideration for the improvements to be not her
    obligation or duty, that she fully retained the right to dispose of her
    property as she saw fit, and that at best, she thought that after her own
    death, her daughter Luisa might see fit to make some allowance for the
    improvements made by Franco. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the
    respondent fixed at $30,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes. </p>
