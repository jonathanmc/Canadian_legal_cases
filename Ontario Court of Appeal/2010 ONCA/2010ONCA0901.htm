  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>I</span></b></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal brought with leave from the order of
    the Divisional Court dismissing the appellant’s claim on the basis that it did
    not disclose a cause of action.  The
    Divisional Court’s reasons are reported at [2009] O.J. No. 5618.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court had allowed an appeal brought with
    leave from the order of Charbonneau J. (the motion judge) certifying the action
    as a class action under the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6 and directing that the appellant be
    the representative plaintiff.  The
    reasons of Charbonneau J. are reported at [2007] O.J. No. 3526. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the end of counsel for the appellant’s oral
    submissions, the court indicated that the appeal would be dismissed with
    reasons to follow.  Those reasons are set
    out below. </p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>II</span></b></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was arrested on November 1, 2005.  On November 2, 2005, a justice of the Ontario
    Court of Justice ordered the appellant assessed pursuant to s. 672.11.  He directed that the assessment take place at
    the psychiatric facility in Ottawa and that the appellant be held in custody in
    that hospital or a detention centre during the term of the assessment order.  The appellant was held in custody in the
    detention centre until November 17<sup>th</sup> when a hospital bed became
    available and she was transferred to the hospital for the psychiatric
    assessment.  The transfer was delayed in
    part because the appellant wanted to be assessed by a French speaking
    psychiatrist.  The assessment was
    completed within the 30-day time period set out in the assessment order of November
    2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant brings this action on her own behalf and
    on behalf of other persons also ordered assessed pursuant to s. 672.11 and
    detained in a jail pending the availability of a bed in the hospital where the
    assessment was to be conducted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The details of the factual background and the pleadings
    are set out in the reasons of Charbonneau J. and the reasons of the Divisional
    Court.  We do not propose to repeat them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant submits that the statement of
    claim reveals three viable claims.  He
    submits that the appellant’s rights under s. 7 and s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i> were violated when she was
    detained in a jail pending the availability of a bed in the hospital where the
    assessment under s. 672.11 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> was to be conducted.  Counsel
    submits that these <i>Charter</i> violations
    give rise to a damage remedy under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel further submits that the detention in the jail
    rather than in a hospital is a breach of the fiduciary duty owed by Ontario to
    the appellant.  Counsel submits that the
    appellant, by virtue of her mental condition, was a particularly vulnerable
    person and as she was under the control of the respondent while in custody, the
    respondent owed her a fiduciary duty.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, counsel submits that the Crown was negligent
    in failing to comply with the order of Justice Desmarais issued in <i>R. v. Hussein</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 4594 in
    November 2004.  Counsel submits that in <i>Hussein</i>, Desmarais J. ordered the
    Ontario government to have sufficient hospital beds available at all times to
    permit the immediate transfer to the hospital for assessment of all persons
    ordered assessed in custody and in the hospital under s. 672.11.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were other claims set out in the Statement of
    Claim that did not survive the initial motion before Charbonneau J.  The appellant no longer advances those
    claims.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, counsel acknowledged that each of the
    claims now being advanced depends on the existence of a duty on the Crown to
    place the appellant in the hospital where her assessment was to be performed
    immediately rather than to detain her in a jail pending the availability of a
    bed at the hospital.  Counsel submits
    that this duty can be found by implication in the language of the relevant sections
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, or as an
    expression of the Crown’s fiduciary duty owed to the appellant, or as a
    manifestation of the Crown’s obligation to implement the judicial order made by
    Desmarais J.  Counsel emphasizes that
    this is not the time or place to decide the merits of any of these claims and
    that he need only show that it is not “plain and obvious” that the claims
    cannot succeed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel also submits that this action does not target
    the conduct of those Crown servants who implemented the specific orders made in
    respect of the appellant’s assessment, but is aimed at those unnamed Crown
    officials whose funding decisions have left the persons responsible for the
    implementation of assessment orders made under s. 672.11 incapable of
    fulfilling their obligations under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Underfunding is not a cause of action.  Before the claim can proceed, the appellant
    must have an arguable personal cause of action against identifiable
    defendants.  Funding or institutional
    shortcomings in the procedures in place for enforcing assessment orders do not
    in their own right provide the basis for a lawsuit.</p>
  <h1><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>III</span></b></h1>
  <h3>The <i>Criminal Code</i> Provisions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assessment orders made under s. 672.11 are governed by
    Part XX.I.  Section 672.13 sets out the
    contents of an assessment order.  The
    assessment order must indicate the person to conduct the assessment or the
    hospital where the assessment is to be conducted.  The order must also state whether the person
    is to be held in custody while the assessment order is in force.  By operation of the definition of hospital in
    s. 672.1, a person can be in custody while in one of the appropriately designated
    hospitals.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in s. 672.13 limiting custody to
    custody in a hospital.  Nor does the form
    provided for assessment orders contain any such limitation.  The orders in this case provided for the
    appellant’s custody in the designated hospital or the named detention
    centre.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assessment orders are time limited.  Generally speaking, they are in force for no
    more than 30 days.  In addition, a person
    must be returned to the court forthwith after the assessment is completed:  <i>Criminal
    Code</i> ss. 672.14, 672.15 and 672.17.  Taken together, the sections clearly indicate Parliament’s intention
    that assessments ordered under s. 672.11 should be completed with
    dispatch.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 672.16 speaks directly to the question of
    custody during the tenure of an assessment order.  Nothing in the section limits either the
    normal meaning of the word custody or the place where an accused may be held in
    custody.  As is evident from the grounds
    upon which persons can be held in custody, custody may be warranted for reasons
    other than the need to place the person in custody for the purposes of the
    assessment.  The observation in <i>R. v. Rosete</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 1608 at
    para. 19 that custody during the currency of the assessment order can only be
    justified for the purpose of effecting the assessment is inconsistent with the
    language of s. 672.16 and is, with respect, in error.  Section 672.16(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)
    and (c) expressly contemplate that custody can be justified during the
    assessment period on grounds that are unrelated to the carrying out of the
    assessment itself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 672.16 does not limit custody to the hospital
    where the assessment occurs.  It speaks to
    custody during the time period that the assessment order is in effect.  Accused persons who are assessed will not necessarily
    be confined in the hospital for that entire period of the assessment order.  Practically <span class=GramE>speaking,</span> there will inevitably be some time needed to move the accused from a detention centre
    to the hospital.  In addition, there will
    often be some time after the assessment is completed, but before the person is
    returned to court where detention in the hospital would be unnecessary and
    perhaps inappropriate.  Consequently,
    orders made under s. 672.11 will almost inevitably provide for detention in the
    designated hospital and a detention centre.  There is, however, nothing to prevent a judge in a specific case where
    it is reasonable to do so to make an order that an accused be taken directly to
    the hospital.  Judges can also order
    detention in a specific place pending transfer to the hospital in an
    appropriate case.  The <i>Criminal Code</i> provides ample flexibility
    to allow judges to fashion orders that are appropriate to the specific
    circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that it is “plain and obvious” that
    the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> cannot be interpreted as requiring that accused who are ordered
    assessed in custody in a hospital must be taken immediately to that hospital
    and cannot be detained in a detention centre pending transfer to the
    hospital.  To the extent that <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Rosete</span></i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>Hussein</i> are read as holding that the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires immediate transfer to a hospital, those
    cases are wrongly decided.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our interpretation of the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is consistent with the
    interpretation given by the motion judge and the Divisional Court.  Notwithstanding that the motion judge certified
    the action as a class proceeding, he concluded that the orders under which the
    appellant was held in custody in the detention centre were lawful orders made
    pursuant to the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  In finding the orders to be
    lawful, the motion judge, of necessity, rejected the appellant’s interpretation
    of the relevant <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions.  While counsel for the
    appellant purported to accept the finding of the motion judge that the
    detention was lawful, his argument with respect to the proper interpretation of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> indirectly attacks
    that finding.  For the reasons set out
    above, we agree with the motion judge and the Divisional Court that the
    appellant’s <span class=GramE>detention in the detention centre</span> was
    lawful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The determination that the appellant was held in
    custody pursuant to lawful court orders made under a statutory power, the
    constitutionality of which is unchallenged, dooms the appellant’s arguments
    that her incarceration in a detention centre violated s. 7 and/or s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.  That is not to say that in a given case, the specific circumstances of
    an accused’s incarceration pending assessment could not give rise to a <i>Charter</i> claim.  In our view, however, it is plain and obvious
    that the mere fact that the appellant was detained in the detention centre
    under lawful orders pending transfer to a hospital cannot give rise to a <i>Charter</i> claim under s. 7 or s. 9.  </p>
  <h3>The Fiduciary Duty Claim</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This claim cannot possibly succeed.  The Crown’s duties to the appellant and to
    the public are circumscribed by the terms of the orders made in respect of the
    appellant’s custody and the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The Crown was
    obliged to implement the court orders in accordance with their terms and in a
    manner consistent with the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In doing so,
    its obligation was to act in the public interest.  That obligation could not possibly co-exist
    with a fiduciary obligation to the appellant to act in her best interests to
    the point of disregarding or compromising the Crown’s obligation to act within
    the terms of the court orders and the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <h3>The Failure to Implement a Judicial Order</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant refers to the reasons of Desmarais
    J. in <i>R. v. Hussein</i> and submits that
    they constitute an order requiring the Crown to have available adequate
    resources to permit the immediate transfer to custody in a hospital of all
    persons ordered assessed in a hospital.  There are passages in the reasons in <i>Hussein</i> that might bear that reading.  Other
    passages suggest a much narrower determination by Desmarais J.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fundamental problem with this claim, however, is
    that there is no order in <i>Hussein</i>.  No order was ever taken out.  Reasons for judgment are not a judicial
    order.  One cannot extract a meaning from
    a part of the reasons for judgment and declare it to be a judicial order
    binding on the Crown.  It is particularly
    inappropriate to equate to parts of reasons for judgment with a “judicial
    order” where the meaning to be taken from the reasons as a whole is unclear,
    and the meaning relied on as constituting the “judicial order” is not found
    expressly in the reasons, but is a matter of inference from some of the
    language used in the reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with the appellant’s argument where
    there is no actual order in existence is evident in the appellant’s
    pleadings.  In para. 12 of her claim, she
    describes the order allegedly made by Desmarais J. as requiring the Ontario government:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To ensure that there are a sufficient number of
    secure beds available in Ontario to comply with the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A judicial order in the terms described above would not
    assist the appellant in establishing an arguable cause of action.  On our interpretation of the relevant
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the
    appellant has not pled any facts that could support the claim that her
    detention was contrary to the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> much less that it was contrary to the <i>Criminal Code</i> because there were
    insufficient resources available to make compliance with the <i>Code</i> possible.</p>

  <h3>Postscript </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These reasons should not be taken as condoning the warehousing
    in detention centres of persons who are apparently mentally ill and have been ordered
    assessed in a hospital.  There can be no
    doubt that the incarceration of mentally ill persons in a jail setting risks
    further deterioration of their mental state and potentially places them at real
    risk of physical harm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judges in the Ontario Court of Justice must regularly deal
    with the difficult problem of accommodating persons in need of in custody
    hospital assessments.  As the facts of
    this case demonstrate, those judges are acutely aware that the available
    resources will not always match the immediate needs of those requiring in
    custody hospital assessments.  Judges routinely
    make inquiries as to the availability of bed space before making assessment
    orders and do their best to minimize the time that an accused must wait in a
    detention centre for a hospital bed.  In
    doing so judges must bear in mind the terms of section 672.16.  If detention of the accused is justified only
    for the purpose of assessment and a bed is not readily available, the accused
    should not be ordered held in custody.  In that circumstance, a judge can order the
    accused released on bail and defer the making of an assessment order until a
    bed is available.  The judge can also
    make it clear to the Crown that if an in custody assessment in the hospital is
    necessary, there will be no assessment ordered until a bed is available and the
    case will not proceed without that assessment.  The Crown, of course, has the constitutional obligation to bring accused
    to trial within a reasonable time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much more often, judges of the Ontario Court of Justice
    are faced with the situation where the accused’s detention is justified on
    public safety grounds as well as on assessment grounds.  In that situation, releasing the accused is
    not an option.  If a judge is told that there
    will be some delay in making a bed available, the judge will be required to
    make an order that contemplates incarceration of the accused in a detention
    centre before he is transferred to the hospital.  In those circumstances, the judge may inquire
    into the location of the proposed detention and the circumstances of that
    detention.  The judge can, where
    appropriate, make specific orders with respect to the place and circumstances of
    incarceration.  The judge can also monitor
    the availability of space in the hospital by requiring, as was done in this
    case, that the accused be brought back within a few days of the initial order
    for a “bed check”.  There may also come a
    point where an order directing transfer to the hospital is an appropriate
    exercise of the judge’s discretion.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The process described above is far from perfect.  It is, however, consistent with the
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and responsive
    to the reality faced by judges who are asked to make in custody hospital
    assessment orders when available resources cannot immediately accommodate those
    orders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, nothing in these reasons should be taken as
    excluding the possibility of a claim based on a detention that is not
    consistent with the terms of the applicable judicial order, or reflects an inordinate
    and unreasonable delay in placing an accused into a hospital setting for
    assessment, or is based on allegations relating to the specific conditions in
    which a mentally ill accused was detained pending transfer to the hospital. </p>
