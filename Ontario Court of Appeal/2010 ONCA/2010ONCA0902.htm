  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Athanasios Bogiatzis, appeals from his
    convictions and sentence by a court composed of Grossi J. and a jury on charges
    of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and trafficking in cocaine. The law of
    conspiracy and, in particular, the directions to the jury on the application of
    the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule can be difficult and was
    especially in this case because of the particular facts before the court. First,
    this was a situation which involved an alleged two-person conspiracy between
    the accused and a co-conspirator.  Here,
    the alleged co-conspirator had already pleaded guilty to and was sentenced for
    one of the offences charged.  The other
    challenge posed by the case was that, while the indictment alleged a two-man conspiracy
    culminating with the sale by the other conspirator of a quantity of cocaine to
    a police agent, the Crown sought the evidentiary benefit of a conspiracy it
    alleged continued for many more months.  In this appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred by not
    tailoring the directions given to the jury on how to apply the co-conspirators’
    exception to the hearsay rule to the particular fact scenario. The appellant
    also submits that the trial judge erred in admitting hearsay evidence of conversations
    between the alleged co-conspirator and police agent that transpired during the
    months after the sale transaction and, in any event, misdirected the jury
    concerning the use of this evidence and proof of the conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the sentence appeal, the appellant submits that the
    sentence of five years and four months in addition to 16 months of pre-sentence
    custody was excessive and, that the trial judge erred in making an order under
    s. 743.6 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that
    the appellant serve one-half of his <span class=GramE>sentence</span> before he
    becomes eligible for parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would allow the conviction
    appeal and order a new trial.  In the
    result, it is not necessary to deal with the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Cocaine Transaction: April to June 7, 2006</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two principal Crown witnesses.  The first witness, David Atwell, was a member
    of the Hell’s Angels who had become a police informer.  The Crown’s case depended upon the truth and
    reliability of his evidence.  The second
    witness, Tom Christodoulou, was a friend of the appellant, and was alleged to
    be the other member of the conspiracy. It was in fact Christodoulou who
    delivered one kilogram of cocaine to Atwell for a price of $27,500 on June 7,
    2006.  Although a Crown witness, Christodoulou
    did not support the Crown’s case against the appellant.  He testified that there was no agreement
    between him and the appellant to traffic in narcotics.  While he may have used the appellant’s name
    in conversations with Atwell, he did so to further his own personal drug
    trafficking enterprise.  The appellant,
    however, had not agreed with him to traffic in cocaine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The Crown’s case turns on a series of meetings between Atwell and
    Christodoulou, two of which also included the appellant.  Atwell, Christodoulou and the appellant first
    met by chance on April 13, 2006.  By this
    time, Atwell had been a paid police agent for some time, engaged in an
    operation targeting the Hell’s Angels.  While returning from a meeting connected with that operation, he noticed
    two men in the driveway of an associate and approached them.  The two men were the appellant and
    Christodoulou.  Because he had been
    involved in the police operation, Atwell was wearing a body-pack transmitter
    and thus there is an audio recording of this first meeting.  After exchanging pleasantries, Atwell
    suggested they should get together and he asked for a telephone number.  The appellant told Christodoulou to give him
    the number.  According to Atwell,
    Christodoulou wrote down a telephone number on a piece of paper and handed it
    to him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>Atwell’s next encounter with the appellant and Christodoulou also appears
    to have been by chance.  A week later, on
    April 20, Atwell noticed the two men in a Pizza Pizza outlet in Toronto.  Atwell was not wearing the body pack on this
    occasion and thus the accuracy of what happened depends upon the testimony of
    the two Crown witnesses, Atwell and Christodoulou; the appellant did not
    testify.  On Atwell’s version, he raised
    with both men the idea of purchasing cocaine.  It was his evidence that either the appellant or Christodoulou said they
    would sell “their” cocaine for $27,500 per kilogram.  Christodoulou’s version was different.  He testified that he believed the drug-related
    conversation took place outside the Pizza <span class=SpellE>Pizza</span> and
    only involved him and Atwell.  As a
    result of this meeting, the appellant and Christodoulou became targets of the
    police investigation and the police instructed Atwell to try and purchase
    cocaine from them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the weeks following April 20, Atwell on several
    occasions called the number he had been given on April 13.  He finally received a call back from
    Christodoulou and they arranged to meet on June 6 at the Esquire Restaurant in
    Toronto.  Although Atwell was wearing a
    body pack on this occasion, the device malfunctioned and so the court was
    presented with two versions of what transpired that day.  Atwell and Christodoulou met for lunch and
    discussed the sale of cocaine.  After
    lunch, Christodoulou, who did not drive, made a telephone call and then asked
    Atwell to drive him to <span class=SpellE>Harry’s</span> Hamburgers.  The two men drove to the restaurant where
    they met up with the appellant.  According to Atwell, Christodoulou told the appellant that he wanted a
    kilogram of cocaine, to which the appellant replied “cool”.  The appellant asked if the cocaine was for
    Atwell and Atwell answered that it was.  Atwell also testified that it was at this time that he made arrangements
    to meet Christodoulou and the appellant at a hotel in Pickering the next day to
    complete the transaction.  He would get a
    telephone call when either Christodoulou or the appellant was in the
    lobby.  Atwell would then bring them to
    his room.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Christodoulou denied that any drug related conversation
    took place in the presence of the appellant at <span class=SpellE>Harry’s</span> Hamburgers, as the arrangements had already been made at the other
    restaurant.  It was his evidence that he
    wanted the ride to <span class=SpellE>Harry’s</span> Hamburgers only so that he
    could meet up with the appellant and <span class=GramE>get</span> a ride home downtown
    with him.  The meeting involving the three
    men was extremely brief and Atwell left after a few minutes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 7, 2006, Christodoulou met Atwell at the
    Pickering hotel where Atwell purchased one kilogram of cocaine for
    $27,500.  They discussed how long it
    would take Atwell to sell the cocaine.  Atwell
    told Christodoulou that he could sell it by mid-July.  He said he was not “big Tommy” (an apparent
    reference to the appellant) but that his customers were solid.  This meeting was both audio and video recorded.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Post-June 7, 2006 Meetings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the objection of defence counsel, the trial judge
    permitted Crown counsel to lead evidence of three meetings between Atwell and
    Christodoulou after the June 7<sup>th</sup> meeting.  The appellant was not present at any of these
    meetings.  These three meetings were audio
    recorded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 27, Christodoulou told Atwell that he could
    probably sell cocaine to him for less than the June 7th price.  Atwell said that he was pleased to be doing
    business with “you guys” and Christodoulou said “we <span class=SpellE>gotta</span> move some customers again” and that “the club guys... do it for us”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 18, 2006, Atwell again met with
    Christodoulou and arranged for another sale of cocaine.  Atwell said that he wanted to “deal with you
    guys again”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A week later on October 24, Atwell again met with Christodoulou
    and they had further discussions about a cocaine sale and talked price and
    quality.  The Crown particularly relied
    upon this part of the conversation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Christodoulou:            Like fuck I don’t mind making a
    thousand bucks me and Tom just split five hundred each like I’ve known you
    twenty fucking years (unintelligible)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Atwell:                         Let him know that last
    time I got that <span class=SpellE>fuckin</span> key off him it was dynamite I
    want to thank him for that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Christodoulou:            Yeah <span class=SpellE>yeah</span> it’s always <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> be dynamite Dave he’ll always be I
    won’t I won’t bring it to you if it’s shit I won’t even waste your time I got
    guys that offer it to me for twenty two right now today beige</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Christodoulou, the appellant was not
    involved in the sale of cocaine.  He
    explained that Atwell had known the appellant for a long time.  Christodoulou did not correct Atwell’s
    apparent belief that the appellant was involved in the trafficking because he thought
    he would be able to convince Atwell to purchase more cocaine if Atwell believed
    the appellant was involved.  He would
    bring up the appellant’s name in order to impress Atwell so he could get more
    business from him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence mounted a substantial attack on the
    credibility of the police agent, David Atwell.  I need not review that evidence in detail.  Suffice to say that there were concerns with
    Atwell’s credibility including some important inconsistencies in his recollection
    of the events, the fact that any time there were drug-related conversations with
    the appellant the recording device was not present or was not operating, that
    he was receiving substantial payments from the police for his cooperation in
    the investigation, and his record of offences and other misconduct while a
    member of the Hell’s Angels.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal
    against conviction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'>(1)       The trial judge erred in admitting the
    conversations between Atwell and Christodoulou of June 7, June 27, October 18
    and October 24 under the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       Even
    if the conversations were admissible, the trial judge misdirected the jury as
    to the application of the co-conspirators’ exception.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       The
    trial judge erred in failing to determine whether the post-June 7 conversations <span class=GramE>were  admissible</span> as similar fact evidence and erred in failing to give a limiting instruction
    concerning those conversations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       The
    trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury to ignore Atwell’s opinion that
    the appellant was a drug dealer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)       The
    trial judge erred in permitting Crown counsel to cross-examine Christodoulou on
    his pattern of protecting the appellant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6)       The
    trial judge misdirected the jury concerning party liability, especially as it
    applied to the conspiracy charge.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         Grounds of Appeal Concerning the Co-conspirators’
    Exception</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)        Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first three grounds of appeal concern the application
    of the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule.  As I indicated, this case presents a
    particularly difficult application of the exception because (1) there were only
    two persons in the conspiracy, Christodoulou and the appellant; and (2) there
    were two different conspiracies <span class=GramE>alleged,</span> the one in
    the indictment (the narrow conspiracy) and the on-going conspiracy (the broader
    conspiracy).  The indictment alleged that
    the appellant and Christodoulou conspired in the City of Toronto and the City
    of Pickering to traffic in cocaine “between the 6<sup>th</sup> day of April and
    the 7<sup>th</sup> day of June in the year 2006”.  Thus, the indictment embraced the period from
    the first chance meeting on April 13 to the transaction in the hotel in
    Pickering on June 7.  The Crown, however,
    attempted to prove that there was a continuing conspiracy that extended at
    least to October of 2006 when Christodoulou continued to meet with Atwell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until the co-conspirators’ exception was attacked on
    the basis that it did not conform with the principled approach to admissibility
    of hearsay evidence, the leading decision on the application of the exception
    was found in <i>R. v. Carter</i>, [1982] 1
    S.C.R. 938.  Because <i>Carter</i> was a jury case, the exception is explained in terms of the
    directions to the jury and consists of three stages, at p. 947:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In charging the jury on this question,
    the trial judge should instruct them [1] to consider whether on all the evidence
    they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy charged in the
    indictment existed. If they are not satisfied, then the accused charged with
    participation in the conspiracy must be acquitted. [2] If, however, they
    conclude that a conspiracy as alleged did exist, they must then review the
    evidence and decide whether, on the basis of the evidence directly receivable
    against the accused, a probability is raised that he was a member of the
    conspiracy. [3] If this conclusion is reached, they then become entitled to
    apply the hearsay exception and consider evidence of the acts and declarations
    performed and made by the co-conspirators in furtherance of the objects of the
    conspiracy as evidence against the accused on the issue of his guilt. This
    evidence, taken with the other evidence, may be sufficient to satisfy the jury
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was a member of the conspiracy and
    that he is accordingly guilty. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Numbering added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Part of the
    difficulty that arises in this case is because the directions concerning the application
    of the hearsay exception are interwoven with the directions on the elements of
    the conspiracy offence itself.  Thus, as
    explained in <i>Carter</i>, first, the trial
    judge should instruct the jury to consider whether “on all the evidence” they
    are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy charged in the
    indictment existed.  If they are not so
    satisfied then the accused must be acquitted.  This first stage is awkward and potentially difficult to apply where
    only a two-person conspiracy is alleged.  The problem lies in instructing the jury that it can use “all the
    evidence”, which potentially includes hearsay evidence, to decide whether there
    is a conspiracy.  In using all the
    evidence to decide beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy exists, the
    jury has, as a matter of logic and common sense, concluded that the two members
    of the conspiracy are guilty.  This is
    unfair to the two accused, or the one accused on trial as in this case, because
    the finding of guilt has been based on hearsay evidence that may or may not be
    admissible, depending on resolution of the next two stages of <i>Carter.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The possible confusion and prejudice are enhanced in a
    two-person conspiracy because of the weaving in of the directions on the
    application of the exception with the directions on the conspiracy offence
    itself.  As indicated, according to <i>Carter</i>, the trial judge is to instruct
    the jury that, if they do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    conspiracy existed, the accused must be acquitted.  In a two-person conspiracy the inevitable
    logical corollary to this direction is that, if the conspiracy does exist
    beyond a reasonable doubt, then the guilt of the only two members must have
    been established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the second stage of <i>Carter</i>, having concluded that a conspiracy as alleged did exist, the
    jury must then review the evidence and decide whether, on the basis of the
    evidence directly receivable against the accused, not including hearsay
    evidence,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

'>[1]</span></span></span></a> a probability is raised that the accused was a member of the conspiracy. If
    not, then, of course, the accused must be acquitted.  One of the issues in this case is whether
    probable membership must be established in relation to the broader conspiracy
    alleged by the Crown or only the narrow conspiracy charged in the indictment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the third stage of the <i>Carter</i> test, the jury is entitled to apply the hearsay exception
    and consider evidence of the acts and declarations performed and made by the
    co-conspirators in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy as evidence
    against the accused on the issue of his guilt. This evidence, taken with the
    other evidence, may be sufficient to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the accused was a member of the conspiracy and that accordingly, he is guilty.  The “in furtherance” requirement is an issue
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in this case, the <i>Carter</i> instructions raise the following questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       How
    is the first stage to be explained to a jury when all that is alleged is a
    two-person conspiracy?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       Can
    the exception operate to include statements made outside the conspiracy alleged
    in the indictment?  If so, then at the
    second stage, must it be shown from the accused’s own acts and declarations
    that he is probably a member of the broader conspiracy?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       Does
    a judge have any role in determining whether statements meet the in furtherance
    requirement?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      The first stage in a two-person conspiracy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty posed by the first stage of the <i>Carter</i> analysis in a two-person conspiracy
    is the risk that the jury will have found the accused guilty at the first stage
    by using all of the evidence, including hearsay statements from the
    co-conspirator, that may not be properly admissible against the accused.  The problem arises because the essence of a
    conspiracy is an agreement.  If the jury
    has found an agreement and there are only two people involved, it follows that
    both must be guilty; otherwise there could be no agreement.  I  admit that the application of the <i>Carter</i> formula in a two-person conspiracy is challenging, but the Supreme Court of
    Canada, albeit in <i>obiter,</i> has held in <i>R. v. Barrow</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694 at 742-43,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

'>[2]</span></span></span></a> that it is applicable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application of <i>Carter</i> in a two-person conspiracy starts with the principle that it is possible to
    have a two-person conspiracy in which only one person is convicted.  For example, the jury might well find on the
    basis of all the evidence that there was an agreement and might well find on
    the basis of the evidence admissible against one person that that person was a
    party to the conspiracy.  There might
    not, however, be sufficient admissible evidence of the other person’s probable
    membership in the two person agreement:  see <span class=SpellE><i>Guimond</i></span><i> v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 960 at
    977 and <i>R. v. Barrow</i>, at pp. 742-43.  An example, similar to the one used by
    McIntyre J. in <i>Barrow,</i> shows how the <i>Carter</i> formula would apply.  Assume a conspiracy allegedly involving only
    an agreement between A and B in which A gives a statement to the police in
    which he says that he and B conspired to traffic in cocaine.  Using all the evidence at stage one,
    including the statement, the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that
    a conspiracy involving A and B to traffic in cocaine existed.  However, the statement has a limited
    use.  It could be used to establish the
    existence of the conspiracy at stage one, and can also be used to show A’s
    probable membership in the conspiracy at stage two. However, as against B, the
    statement cannot be used to show that B was a probable member of the conspiracy
    at stage two.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty therefore lies not in the theory of the
    application of the exception to a two-person conspiracy, but in the need for
    careful instructions on what evidence the jury may use at the various stages of
    the <i>Carter</i> analysis, and how the
    evidence may be used.  To return to the <i>Barrow</i> example, the jury would have to
    be told that they could use A’s statement for the limited purposes of deciding
    whether a conspiracy existed, and to determine A’s probable membership in the
    conspiracy.  However, the jury must be
    instructed that it could not use A’s statement for the improper purpose of
    deciding whether B was a probable member of the conspiracy.  I admit that this places the jury in a very
    difficult position as they attempt to juggle the use of various pieces of
    evidence.  And, the problem for the trial
    judge in attempting to charge the jury is acute where the evidence is not as
    clear cut as in the <i>Barrow</i> example.  However, until the Supreme
    Court of Canada holds otherwise, I do not see that it is open to this court to
    abandon the <i>Carter</i> test in a
    two-person conspiracy.<a href="#_ftn3"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Viandante</i> (1995), 40 C.R. (4th) 353 (Man. C.A.), <span class=SpellE>Huband</span> J.A. speaking
    for the court, grappled with the difficulty of applying <i>Carter</i> in a two-person conspiracy case.  In that case, the court was of the view that
    the trial judge had failed to make it clear at stage one of <i>Carter</i> that proof of the existence of a
    two-person conspiracy involving one of the alleged conspirators did not mean
    that the other accused’s guilt in the same two-person conspiracy was
    established.  In other words, in using
    “all the evidence” at stage one, would the jury understand that finding the
    conspiracy existed did not necessarily determine either of the two accused’s
    membership in that conspiracy?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge in this case made an
    admirable attempt to deal with this difficult issue.  He obviously recognized that the most serious
    risk of prejudice was that the jury would use the post-June 7 conversations to
    decide whether the narrow conspiracy existed and by necessary inference use
    those conversations to decide that the appellant was a member of the
    conspiracy.  Accordingly, in his
    directions at stage one as to whether a conspiracy <span class=GramE>existed,</span> the trial judge referred the jury to only the pre-June 7 conversations.  However, the trial judge also told the jury
    that they “should consider all the circumstances including, but not only, what
    each person alleged to be a member of that conspiracy did or did not say, did
    or did not do, as well as how he did or did not do it” and to take into account
    “what the alleged participants said and did in the circumstances in which the
    words were spoken and the conduct took place”.  In my view, there was a danger that the jury would have used all of the
    evidence, including statements made by Christodoulou when the appellant was not
    present, possibly even the post-June 7 conversations, to find that the
    conspiracy between the appellant and Christodoulou existed and necessarily that
    the appellant was a member of the conspiracy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As difficult a concept as it may be, the trial judge
    was required to instruct the jury that while they were entitled to use all the
    evidence to decide whether the conspiracy existed, that determination did not
    decide the issue of the appellant’s membership because of the evidentiary rules
    surrounding the use of hearsay.  While
    hearsay in the form of Christodoulou’s statements, even those made in the
    absence of the appellant, was available to prove the existence of the
    conspiracy, it was not available to prove the appellant’s membership in the
    conspiracy until certain further steps were taken:  see <i>Viandante</i> at paras. 50 - 51.  I recognize that this
    puts a heavy burden on the trial judge to instruct the jury on what would seem
    to them to be esoteric and abstract principles.  I will provide some suggestions at the conclusion of this part of the
    reasons as to how these concepts might sensibly be conveyed to the jury.  As I will explain, in my view, the key to
    make the directions understandable and workable in a two-person conspiracy is
    to sever the directions on the exception from the directions on the elements of
    conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that the jury would have understood
    that determining the issue of whether a conspiracy existed did not determine
    that the appellant was a member of the conspiracy. This submission is based principally
    on the fact that the instructions in stage one of the <i>Carter</i> test were immediately followed by instructions on the issue
    of the appellant’s probable membership (<i>Carter</i>,
    stage two), along with the direction that the appellant must not be found
    guilty if he was probably not a member of the conspiracy.  I recognize the strength of the Crown’s
    submission and it may be that if this were the only problem with the charge to
    the jury this might be an appropriate case for application of the proviso.
    Unfortunately, that was not the only problem.</p>
  <h4><span> </span><span lang=EN-US>(iii)    Applying the exception beyond the conspiracy alleged in the
    indictment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next issue to be considered is how to apply the
    co-conspirators’ exception in a case where the Crown seeks to rely on
    declarations of co-conspirators outside the conspiracy alleged in the
    indictment.  In <i>Carter</i>, at p. 947, McIntyre J. framed the second stage of the
    application of the co-conspirators exception in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If they are not satisfied, then the accused charged
    with participation in the conspiracy must be acquitted. If, however, they
    conclude that a <i>conspiracy as alleged</i> did exist, they must then review the evidence and decide whether, on the basis
    of the evidence directly receivable against the accused, a probability is
    raised that he was a member of the conspiracy. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This excerpt from <i>Carter</i> does not answer the question in a case such as this where the conspiracy
    alleged in the indictment is different from the conspiracy sought to proven for
    the purposes of the hearsay exception.  However, resort to first principles can, I believe, provide the
    answer.  First, it becomes necessary to
    draw a bright line between the conspiracy alleged in the indictment and the
    broader actual agreement reached by the participants.  The conspiracy alleged in the indictment may
    or may not be an artificial construct.  In some cases, the conspiracy alleged in the indictment will coincide
    exactly with the agreement reached by the conspirators.  The conspiracy may have been to achieve a
    discrete act that was either achieved or frustrated by arrest on a known
    date.  However, in some cases, and the
    Crown alleges that this is <span class=GramE>one,</span> the actual agreement
    may be broader than the indictment.  In
    this case, the Crown alleged that Christodoulou and the appellant were in the
    business of trafficking in large amounts of cocaine.  On that theory, the sale to Atwell on June 7,
    2006 was merely one overt act of the conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Sauvé</i> (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at paras. 115-118 and <i>R. v. Vrany</i> (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 14 at p. 26, this court held
    that for the purposes of applying the co-conspirators’ exception one can look
    to the actual agreement and not necessarily the narrower conspiracy alleged in
    the indictment.  However, in my view, for
    the declarations of co-conspirators made in the context of the broader
    conspiracy to be admissible against the accused, the Crown must prove the existence
    of the broader conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt at stage one, and prove the
    accused’s probable membership in the broader conspiracy at stage two.  As this court said in <i>Sauvé</i> at para. 118, the scope of the conspiracy “does not depend on
    the definition of the particular crime charged but the nature of the
    agreement”. Therefore, if the Crown seeks the forensic advantage of the broader
    agreement, it must prove that agreement and the accused’s probable membership
    in that agreement, not just the agreement alleged in the indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two excerpts from this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Chang</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 397
    demonstrate the need for these requirements.  In the first excerpt, at para. 84, the court reviews the theoretical
    basis for the exception:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The co-conspirators' rule is based on the notion
    that the declarant co-conspirator who speaks in furtherance of a conspiracy to
    which the accused is shown to be a party <i>should
    be considered to speak as an agent of the accused</i>. The combination of the <i>principles relating to admissions and agency</i> leads to admissibility.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The theory of agency only makes
    sense in the context of the actual conspiracy to which the accused is alleged
    to be a member, not some other conspiracy. The co-conspirator is not the
    accused’s agent for all possible purposes, but in relation to a specific
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then, when discussing the safeguards that make hearsay
    declarations of co-conspirators sufficiently reliable for the purpose of the
    principled approach to hearsay the court said the following at para. 120:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The third requirement in <i>Carter</i> provides a further safeguard against the use of unreliable
    hearsay. Assuming the hurdles in steps one and two are cleared, the trier of
    fact may rely on hearsay declarations<i>,
    but importantly only if they are made in furtherance of the conspiracy</i>.
    This is critical. It is not enough that the hearsay words or acts pertain to
    the conspiracy. <i>They must be found to
    further the specific unlawful object</i> which has been found to exist beyond a
    reasonable doubt under step one and to which the direct evidence links the
    accused under step two. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This crucial in furtherance requirement must relate to
    the very conspiracy for which the hearsay words are tendered.  They must be found, in the words of <i>Chang</i>, to “further the specific unlawful
    object which has been found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt under step one
    and to which the direct evidence links the accused under step two”.  When the Supreme Court of Canada came to
    consider the same issue in <i>R. v. Mapara</i>,
    [2005] 1 S.C.R. 358, at para. 24, it focused on the reliability inherent in the
    requirement that the accused were pursuing “a common enterprise”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><i>Proof that a conspiracy existed beyond a reasonable doubt and that the
    accused probably participated in it does not merely corroborate the statement
    in issue.</i></span><i> Rather, it attests
    to a common enterprise that enhances the general reliability of what was said
    in the course of pursuing that enterprise</i>. It is similar in its effect to
    the <i>res gestae</i> exception to the hearsay rule, where surrounding context
    furnishes circumstantial indicators of reliability. The concern is not with
    whether a particular statement is corroborated, but rather with circumstantial
    indicators of reliability.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, given the focus on reliability flowing from the
    involvement in the common enterprise, for the exception to apply, the accused
    must be shown to be a probable member of that common enterprise.  Accordingly, for the Crown to rely upon statements
    made in furtherance of the broader conspiracy, the Crown must show that the
    accused was probably a member of that broader conspiracy.  In its factum in this court, the Crown has
    assembled the evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that there was
    a broader conspiracy and that the appellant was probably a member of that
    conspiracy.  The Crown relies on evidence
    such as the long-standing friendship between the appellant and Christodoulou;
    that the two appeared to share a phone; and that they appeared to have kilograms
    of cocaine to sell, not just the single kilogram purchased on June 7.  From this evidence, the Crown suggests a
    trier of fact could draw the common sense inference that the agreement did not
    suddenly end on June 6 or 7.  That may
    well be; however, the difficulty the Crown faces in this case is that whether
    the broader conspiracy existed and whether the appellant was probably a member
    of the broader conspiracy were questions to be put to the jury.  Indeed Crown counsel concedes this point in
    their factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ultimately, whether or not the conspiracy remained
    alive after the June 7, 2006 transaction, and whether or not the post-June 7<sup>th</sup> conversations were in furtherance of that conspiracy, were questions for the
    jury to decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem is that those jury questions were not left
    to the jury to decide.  As I have said
    earlier, the question of whether the conspiracy existed was put solely in
    relation to the conspiracy as alleged in the indictment, that is, the narrow
    conspiracy.  Similarly, the question of
    probable membership was solely based on the pre-June 7 conversations.  The trial judge never expressly asked the
    jury to determine whether the broader conspiracy existed or whether the
    appellant was probably a member of it.  The closest the trial judge came in putting that issue to the jury was
    in a passage set out below, which was concerned with the in furtherance
    requirement at stage three and focused on whether the conspiracy continued in
    existence; there was nothing in those instructions expressly addressing the
    appellant’s probable membership in any ongoing conspiracy.  After instructing the jury that they were not
    limited to the appellant’s own words and conduct at the third stage, the trial judge
    said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Besides that evidence, you may take into account
    anything that any other member of the conspiracy said or did while the
    conspiracy was ongoing for the purpose of achieving its object or purpose, that
    is, to traffic in cocaine.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not everything said and done by any members
    of the conspiracy, charged or uncharged, on trial or not on trial, on which you
    may rely to decide whether Crown counsel has proven beyond a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Bogiatzis was a member of that conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>There are two
    requirements: the words must be spoken and the acts done while the conspiracy
    remains in existence, and in furtherance of the object for the purpose of the
    conspiracy</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To determine whether the conspiracy remained in
    existence, you may wish to consider that Mr. Bogiatzis and Mr. Christodoulou
    met on two occasions, April 20<sup>th</sup> and June 6, 2006 and discussed the
    deal.  With respect to furtherance of the
    object or purpose of the conspiracy, to determine whether the words and acts
    were done in furtherance of the conspiracy, you may wish to consider Mr.
    Bogiatzis and Mr. Christodoulou arranging to meet the agent at the Comfort Inn
    on June 7, 2006 to complete the deal.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, far from focusing on the key question of whether
    the appellant from his own acts and declarations was shown to probably be a
    member of the broader conspiracy, the trial judge simply invited the jury to
    refer back to the pre-June 7 conversations in a manner that focused solely on
    the charged narrow conspiracy not the broader conspiracy.  Over the next several pages the trial judge
    then dealt at length with the post-June 7 conversations between Atwell and
    Christodoulou, suggested how they might be found to be in furtherance of the
    conspiracy and could be interpreted as showing beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the appellant was a member of the narrow conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel argues on appeal that the jury would not
    have used the post-June 7 conversations if they found that the appellant was
    only a probable member of a conspiracy that ended on June 7.  He relies upon the portion of the directions
    set out above:  “There are two
    requirements: the words must be spoken and the acts done while the conspiracy
    remains in existence, and in furtherance of the object for the purpose of the
    conspiracy.”  Counsel submits that this
    direction negates any risk that the jury would have improperly used the
    post-June 7 evidence, given that this was a two-person conspiracy.  I do not agree.  Those directions do not draw the jury’s
    attention to the fundamental factual finding of the appellant’s probable
    membership in the broader conspiracy based solely on his own acts and
    declarations.  To the contrary, the
    directions relied upon by the Crown simply jump over or, at best, assume the
    probable membership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this is not a trivial error.  While there was evidence that the appellant
    was probably a member of a broader conspiracy, that evidence was circumstantial
    and depended upon the jury accepting Atwell’s version of the conversations that
    were not recorded.  Given Atwell’s credibility
    problems it was not inevitable that the jury would have accepted his version of
    events.  On the other hand, the post-June
    7 conversations were recorded and did tend to confirm some of Atwell’s
    evidence.  But, the jury was not entitled
    to use that evidence until it made the preliminary finding of probable
    membership in the broader conspiracy.</p>
  <h4><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>(iv)      The</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> judge’s role and the “in
    furtherance” requirement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with counsel for the appellant that the trial
    judge does have a role in determining whether statements meet the in
    furtherance requirement.  The role,
    however, is a modest one.  The trial
    judge must merely determine whether there is some evidence upon which a jury
    could find that the declaration was made in furtherance of the conspiracy: <i>R. v. McNamara</i> (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193
    (Ont. C.A.) at p. 441.  In this case, the
    trial judge was required to decide whether the post-June 7 statements were
    capable of being in furtherance of the broader conspiracy.  Much that is contained in very lengthy
    recordings is not in furtherance of the conspiracy, but equally is not
    prejudicial; it amounts to discussion between Atwell and Christodoulou about
    any number of topics having nothing to do with the appellant.  I have earlier set out those few
    conversations that the parties have identified as potentially prejudicial to
    the appellant.  The Crown submits that
    those conversations are capable of being in furtherance of the conspiracy.  The trial judge’s ruling on this issue was
    brief:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the portions of audio transcript
    establish a nexus, a linkage, if you will, to the accused. The statements, in
    my view, were made in furtherance of the conspiracy in the case at bar. The
    police agent and the declarant present during the audio transcript involved in
    the joint enterprise are available to give evidence and be cross-examined.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the threshold has been met. It will be
    for the jury to determine on the two-stage approach, applying the test of <i>Regina v. Carter</i>. It is not necessary
    that the directly admissible evidence be adduced first before any evidence of
    the acts and declarations of others involved in the joint enterprise may be
    received. The exigencies of the trial will make a chronological separation of
    the evidence impossible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it was open to the trial judge to find that
    the conversations relied upon by the Crown were capable of being in furtherance
    of an on-going conspiracy.  The
    conversations are not simply narrative but an attempt by Christodoulou to reassure
    Atwell of his reliability and entice him into further transactions, sometimes
    by using the appellant’s name:  see <i>R. v. Mota</i> (1979), 46 C.C.C. 273 (Ont.
    C.A.) at p. 283. As such, the conversations were capable of being in
    furtherance of the conspiracy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also challenged the admissibility of the
    June 7 conversations when the one kilogram cocaine transaction took place.  There is no merit to this submission.  As Crown counsel points out, this was a
    recording of the illegal transaction itself, which formed the basis for the
    count of trafficking in cocaine.  More
    importantly, the conversations were to ensure the drug transaction occurred and
    were thus made in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(v)       Limiting instruction on the post-June 7 conversatio</span><span
lang=EN-US>n</span><span lang=EN-US>s</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the post-June 7
    conversations constituted disreputable conduct and the trial judge erred in
    failing to perform a similar fact analysis in accordance with <i>R. v. Handy</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908.  I point out that while defence counsel
    objected to the admissibility of these conversations on the basis that they
    were inadmissible hearsay not being in furtherance of the conspiracy, no
    objection was taken on this basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the similar fact argument is
    misconceived.  The post-June 7
    conversations were not evidence of other disreputable conduct from which a
    trier of fact was asked to reason that the appellant had a specific propensity
    to conspire to traffic in narcotics on other occasions.  Rather they were alleged to be evidence of
    the very agreement that was charged.  On
    the Crown’s theory, there were not two separate conspiracies, one ending on
    June 7 and one continuing until October.  There was only the one conspiracy, which the Crown sought to prove
    through various kinds of evidence, including the post June 7 hearsay statements.  I cannot think of a direction that could be
    given to the jury that would be of any use to the jury in determining whether
    that conspiracy existed and would be of any benefit to the appellant. I would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2          The trial judge erred in failing to
    direct the jury to ignore Atwell’s opinion that the appellant was a drug
    dealer.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that Atwell met with the appellant
    and Christodoulou by chance at a Pizza Pizza outlet on April 20, 2006 and that
    he was not wearing the body pack.  According to Atwell, either Christodoulou or the appellant mentioned
    that “their” kilos were available to him for $27,500.  When asked by Crown counsel why he had used
    the word “their”, Atwell replied as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes. Tom Christodoulou and Tom Bogiatzis
    are partners in dealing cocaine.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        How
    do you know that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I
    know this through previous charges, convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant objected and in the presence
    of the jury stated that the witness well knew that they were acquitted and that
    the appellant had brought a lawsuit in which he was seeking $10 million.  Atwell was then asked to clarify without
    reference to the charges. He then said that the appellant and Christodoulou
    were drug dealers, “and everyone knew it”.  Counsel for the appellant again objected.  Following submissions, Crown counsel asked
    Atwell to focus on this investigation in answering the question of what led him
    to believe that the appellant and Christodoulou were dealing in drugs
    together.  Atwell said:  “The discussion we had at the Pizza
    Pizza.”  I have some difficulty
    understanding why Atwell’s opinion as to why he believed the appellant and
    Christodoulou were dealing in drugs together was relevant; that was a question
    for the jury.  Further, it was
    prejudicial and unfair to permit Atwell to express the opinion that everyone
    knew they were drug dealers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said<span class=GramE>,</span> defence counsel, by
    his quick response to the first set of questions, took much of the sting out of
    Atwell’s answers, and the ultimate answer relating the opinion back to the
    Pizza Pizza conversations was harmless.  Accordingly, <span class=GramE>were this</span> the only error in the
    trial, I would not think it sufficient to warrant a new trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3          The trial judge erred in permitting
    Crown counsel to cross-examine Christodoulou on his pattern of protecting the
    appellant</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he was called as a Crown witness,
    Christodoulou was ultimately found to be a hostile witness and the trial judge
    permitted Crown counsel to cross-examine him at large.  Crown counsel at trial attempted to discredit
    Christodoulou’s evidence that the appellant was not involved in the drug
    trafficking by reference to what was said when Christodoulou pleaded guilty on
    two previous occasions.  Crown counsel
    sought to demonstrate a pattern that in situations where Christodoulou pleaded
    guilty to offences involving him and the appellant, he attempted to protect the
    appellant.  The impugned
    cross-examination focused on two incidents.  In 1998, Christodoulou pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the terms
    of a recognizance.  His counsel stated at
    the time that “my client will not be called against the still accused Mr. Bogiatzis”.  In April 2007, Christodoulou pleaded guilty
    to trafficking in relation to the same events for which the appellant was on trial.  His counsel at the time said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I understand [it] the facts with respect to
    Mr.&nbsp;Christodoulou only are correct, <span class=GramE>Your</span> Honour.  He specifically does not accept
    any facts with respect to Mr. Bogiatzis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that this line of
    cross-examination was irrelevant and prejudiced the appellant because it showed
    that the appellant and Christodoulou had been charged together on prior
    occasions.  In my view, the appellant
    exaggerates the prejudicial effect of the evidence.  There was no surprise that Christodoulou was
    involved in the trafficking charge and that he did not implicate the appellant;
    his own testimony made that clear.  The
    statement by defence counsel during the 1998 proceeding was relatively
    harmless.  While I tend to agree with the
    appellant that the inference the Crown sought to draw from the two proceedings
    was speculative, since there was no prejudice, I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.  On a new trial, Crown
    counsel will want to stay away from this area.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4          The trial judge misdirected the jury
    concerning party liability, especially as it applied to the conspiracy charge.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s position in this case was that the
    appellant and Christodoulou conspired to traffic in cocaine and that both were
    principals in the June 7 sale.  However,
    the Crown also sought an instruction to the jury on party liability.  The direction concerning party liability on
    the substantive trafficking charge was correct and I see no basis for
    complaint.  The direction concerning parties
    to the conspiracy is more problematic.  The trial judge directed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now then, having given you the substantive offences
    – conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and trafficking in cocaine—there is another
    way that the Crown can prove the offences.  It is called parties to an offence.  In this particular case, <i>what the
    Crown is saying is that Mr. Bogiatzis is also a party to the offence of
    conspiracy to traffic in cocaine</i> and he is also a party to the offence of
    trafficking in cocaine. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Applying this law, this section of the Criminal
    Code, to Mr.&nbsp;Bogiatzis, it is the Crown’s position that regarding these
    counts, count 1 and count 2, he was involved in a joint venture with respect to
    the conspiracy to traffic with Mr.&nbsp;Christodoulou, and it has the same
    submissions with respect to the trafficking, <i>but it is also Crown’s position about Bogiatzis’ role in both the
    conspiracy to traffic and the trafficking that his role is also as an aider,
    that he is aiding Mr. Christodoulou in committing the offences that are set out
    in the two charges</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the jury began deliberating they asked a question
    about the definition of trafficking.  At
    the request of Crown counsel, the trial judge also directed the jury about
    party liability and, for reasons that are not clear, the trial judge included
    the instructions on party liability in relation to conspiracy as well as
    trafficking:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to the law of parties to the offence, you
    will recall I talked to you about parties to an offence.  In this case, the Crown’s position is that
    both in the conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and in the trafficking in cocaine,
    Mr. Bogiatzis <span class=GramE>is</span> a party to the offence.  <i>The
    Crown’s position is that he is a party to the offence as a joint principal and
    that he is a party to the offence as an aider</i>.</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center;
'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Aiding
    relates to a specific offence, in this particular case, count 1, the conspiracy
    to traffic in cocaine, and count 2 trafficking in cocaine.</i>  An aider must intend that the offence is
    committed, now that the other person intends to commit it and intend to help
    that person accomplish his goal.  It does
    not matter, as far as the aider is concerned, whether the person who he aids is
    not on trial or cannot be convicted of the offence with respect to the
    conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To establish the accused’s guilt of conspiracy as
    an aider, the Crown must prove that the accused:  <span class=GramE>one,</span> knew the object
    of the conspiracy; number two assisted the conspirators; and three intended to
    assist the conspirators in obtaining their unlawful object.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that this was misdirection
    because it is not possible for the appellant to aid a two-person conspiracy in
    which he was alleged to have been one of the members of the conspiracy. I agree
    with this submission. This court has held that a person may be convicted of
    conspiracy as a party under s. 21 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> if the person abetted or encouraged the conspiracy: <i>McNamara</i> at p. 454.  However, in this case, there was no conspiracy
    to abet if the appellant was not a member of it. Crown counsel submits that
    this error was of no consequence since the jury would have drawn the same
    conclusion, and if they did not find that the appellant was a member of the
    conspiracy, they never would have reached the issue of party liability. There
    was no objection to this aspect of the direction by defence counsel at trial.
    Again, standing alone, this misdirection might not warrant a new trial.  It does, however, add to what was a difficult
    and somewhat confusing charge related to the two-person conspiracy directions.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>5.         Suggested
    Directions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I
    indicated earlier that I would suggest how the trial judge at the new trial
    might approach the difficult issue of the application of the co-conspirators’
    exception in this case.  I would offer this
    possible outline that may be of assistance.  </span>In my view, the first step in giving instructions in this case is
    to draw a clear distinction between the elements of the offence as charged in
    the indictment and the conspiracy allegation for the purpose of the evidentiary
    rule.  In other words, this is not the
    kind of case where the co-conspirators’ exception instructions should be
    integrated into the instructions on proof of the conspiracy.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></span></a>  Thus, the trial judge may first wish to deal
    with elements of the offence as charged in the indictment, namely the
    conspiracy to traffic in cocaine between April 6 and June 7, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge could then consider turning to the
    evidentiary rule by informing the jury that a special rule of evidence applies
    in conspiracy cases and that the prosecution relies on this rule to attempt to
    prove the offence charged in the indictment.  The trial judge would then instruct the jury that in this case Crown
    counsel alleges that the appellant conspired with Christodoulou from April 13
    to October 24, 2006 to traffic in cocaine.  Crown counsel makes this allegation because they wish to have the jury
    rely on hearsay conversations between Atwell and Christodoulou after June 7 to
    prove that the appellant is a member of the conspiracy alleged in the
    indictment.  Ordinarily, those
    conversations would not be evidence against the appellant because he was not
    present during those conversations.  Before Crown counsel is entitled to use those conversations to prove the
    case against the appellant, the jury must make a number of special findings of
    fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that a conspiracy existed from April 13 to October 24, 2006.  In making this finding the jury can use all
    of the evidence, including the June and October conversations when the
    appellant was not present.  However, in
    making that finding, the jury has not determined whether the appellant was, in
    fact, a member of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.  This is because the jury may have used
    hearsay evidence, which may or may not be admissible against the
    appellant.  Whether the jury can use the
    hearsay evidence depends on two further findings of fact.  (The trial judge may, as suggested in <i>Viandante</i> at para. 50, wish to give the
    jury a simple example along the lines of the example used in <i>Barrow</i>.  On the other hand, the judge might feel that to do so would complicate
    matters unnecessarily.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first of two findings the jury must make before
    using the June and October hearsay conversations when the appellant was not
    present is whether the appellant has been shown to probably be a member of the
    April to October conspiracy.  This
    finding must be based on the evidence that is directly admissible against
    him.  At this point the judge would outline
    this evidence, which primarily consists of the comments attributed to him by
    Atwell in the conversations on April 13, April 20 and June 6.  The judge would remind the jury that two of
    these conversations were not recorded and that Christodoulou gives a very
    different version of those conversations.  The judge would also expressly warn the jury that in making this interim
    finding of probable membership, they must not use the hearsay evidence of the
    conversations between Christodoulou and Atwell in June and October when the
    appellant was not present.  If the jury
    finds that the appellant was probably a member of the April to October
    conspiracy they will then go on to decide whether to make the second of the two
    findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the jury finds that the appellant is probably a
    member of the April to October conspiracy, it can then use the hearsay
    statements in June and October to decide whether the appellant has been proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt to be guilty of the conspiracy alleged in the
    indictment, provided the jury makes a second finding of fact, namely that those
    statements were in furtherance of the April to October conspiracy.  The trial judge would then explain the “in
    furtherance” requirement and isolate for the jury the particular conversations upon
    which the prosecution relies as being in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, if the jury makes all of the necessary
    findings, they may use the in furtherance statements made in June and October
    by Christodoulou, or those made by Atwell that Christodoulou adopted, to decide
    whether they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant is a
    member of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.  The judge will want to remind the jury of the
    theory of the defence; that Christodoulou was simply using the appellant’s name
    for his own purposes to sell drugs on his own account to Atwell and that the
    appellant did not conspire with Christodoulou.  If the jury does not make the necessary findings to trigger this special
    evidentiary rule, they must ignore the June and October conversations where the
    appellant was not present and decide the case on the basis of the other
    evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, this is not a proper case to apply the proviso in s. 686(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  Crown counsel at trial spent
    considerable time with both Atwell and </span>Christodoulou on the post-June 7
    conversations.  As I have said, those
    conversations were fully recorded and their probative value did not suffer from
    the frailty of the unrecorded pre-June 7 recordings that depended on the
    reliability and truthfulness of Atwell.  The jury was not properly directed as to how to use those
    conversations.  Further, the directions
    on stage one of <i>Carter</i> <span
class=GramE>were</span> prejudicial to the appellant.  I agree with what the Manitoba Court of
    Appeal said in <i>Viandante</i> at para.
    53:  “The jury may well have been
    confused by the application of the <i>Carter</i> three-step process without appropriate modifications to fit a two-person
    conspiracy.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, in my view, there must be a new trial
    on both the conspiracy charge and the substantive charge of trafficking.  The Crown relied on the same body of evidence
    on both charges since its theory was that the June 7 transaction was simply
    part of the overall conspiracy.  For
    example, in explaining the Crown’s theory, the trial judge said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    each of these occasions [the June 26, October 18 and October 24 meetings
    between </span>Christodoulou and Atwell], they discussed future sales of drugs
    and confirmed in one manner or the other Mr. Bogiatzis’ role in the sale of the
    one kilogram of cocaine completed on June 7, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside
    the convictions and order a new trial.</p>

    the basis of all the evidence, whether there was some evidence upon which a
    trier of fact could decide beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy
    existed.  If the judge decided the stage
    one question in favour of the Crown, the judge would put the stage two and
    stage two questions to the jury.  The
    judge would not, of course, tell the jury that the existence of the conspiracy
    had been established beyond a reasonable doubt and thus potentially pre-empting
