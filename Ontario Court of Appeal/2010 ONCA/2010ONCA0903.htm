    McDonald.</p>

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  He submits that he was improperly excluded
    from the court for part of the jury selection process in contravention of his
    right to be present at his trial set out in s. 650 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, <span class=GramE>c</span>. C-46.  He submits that his exclusion constitutes a
    miscarriage of justice necessitating the quashing of his conviction.  The appellant also argues that the trial
    judge erred in admitting statements made by him to undercover police
    officers.  The appellant contends that
    before admitting those statements, the trial judge was required to determine
    whether they were sufficiently reliable to warrant their admission under the
    principled exception to the hearsay rule.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss the appeal.  The procedural error in the course of the
    jury selection caused no prejudice to the appellant.  There is no merit to the evidentiary point

    2000.  Her body was found in March
    2001.  She was last seen alive at the
    appellant’s apartment.  The Crown’s case
    relied heavily on statements made by the appellant to undercover officers
    during what has come to be known as a “Mr. Big” operation.  In the course of a relationship cultivated by
    undercover officers posing as criminals, those officers induced the appellant
    to tell them about Ms. McDonald’s murder as a means of gaining their trust and
    confidence.  The appellant made
    statements to the undercover officers in which he provided significant details
    about the homicide.  Unbeknownst to the
    appellant, those statements were videotaped.  </p>

    counsel for the appellant indicated that he wished to challenge the jury for
    cause based on pre-trial publicity.  The
    trial judge dismissed the application holding that the defence had produced no
    evidence to support the claim of potential bias based on pre-trial
    publicity.  There is no appeal from that
    ruling.  A discussion about the questions
    to be put to the panel by the trial judge ensued.  After a brief recess, the jury panel was
    brought into the courtroom to be vetted by the trial judge pursuant to s. 632
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The accused was arraigned before the jury panel and
    pled not guilty.  The trial judge addressed
    the panel.  After reading the charge
    against the appellant, the trial judge told the jury panel that there were
    various reasons for excusing prospective jurors from jury duty in any given
    case.  He told them that they could be
    excused if they had any association with persons on a list of names he read to
    the panel.  The trial judge also told the
    jury panel that they could be excused if they had personal knowledge of the
    case, or had reached an opinion as to the merits of the case.  He next told the jury that prospective jurors
    could be excused if they had difficulty hearing, other medical problems that
    would make it difficult for them to sit as jurors, or difficulty understanding
    the English language.  Finally, the trial
    judge told the panel that they could be excused from jury duty if serving on
    the jury would impose an “exceptional personal or financial hardship”.  The trial judge explained that if any of the
    jurors had concerns based on what he had said, they should raise those matters
    with him when they were called forward individually during the jury selection
    process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After a further brief adjournment, the selection
    process commenced with the calling forward of the first group of prospective
    jurors.  When the third juror was called
    forward, the following appears in the transcript: “Private conversation between
    the court and prospective juror.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following the conversation, which took place in
    the courtroom, but out of the earshot of everyone except the trial judge and
    the prospective juror, the trial judge, on the record, indicated the juror had
    a non-refundable prepaid vacation planned and would be excused.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant advised the trial
    judge that he had not heard the conversation between the judge and the
    prospective juror.  The judge responded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Indeed some of it is personal in nature and you need
    to exercise some discretion about <span class=GramE>that, that</span> is
    all.  If you would like to, next time, a
    witness [prospective juror] speaks to me, be party to the conversation you may
    come forward.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant indicated that he
    would avail himself of the trial judge’s invitation.  He also suggested to the trial judge that
    while it may be appropriate that the conversations with the prospective jurors
    should not be public, they should be recorded as part of the trial proceedings.  The trial judge declined to order the
    conversations recorded.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant, who are also counsel for
    the appellant in this court, did not raise any further objection to the procedure
    followed thereafter.  Counsel did not suggest
    at trial that they <span class=GramE>has</span> any difficulty hearing the conversations
    between the trial judge and the prospective jurors.  Significantly, they did not raise any issue
    about the appellant’s inability to hear the conversations, or suggest that the
    appellant’s inability to hear those conversations in any way compromised the
    defence or the appearance of fairness at the trial.  These objections were not raised until some
    five years later on appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jury selection process continued.  Several potential jurors had “private
    conversations” with the trial judge in the courtroom after their names were
    called and they came forward from the body of the courtroom.  Counsel for the appellant and the Crown were present
    and heard these conversations.  Most, but
    not all, of the persons who spoke with the trial judge were excused from jury duty.  If a juror was not excused, the Crown and the
    defence were then given the opportunity to exercise their preemptory challenges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On several instances, persons who were selected
    for the jury immediately raised problems that could potentially affect their ability
    to sit on the jury.  For example, one
    juror who had been selected told the trial judge that he was now concerned that
    he might have employed relatives of the appellant.  When a selected juror raised a problem with
    the trial judge, a “private conversation” followed.  Counsel for the Crown and the appellant were
    privy to these discussions.  In each instance,
    the person who had been selected as a juror was discharged by the trial judge pursuant
    to s. 644(1.1) and a new juror was selected.  None of the 12 persons who eventually tried the case engaged in any of the
    “private conversations” with the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the process carried on, the trial judge sometimes
    gave reasons on the record for excusing or discharging a prospective juror.  In other instances, the juror was simply
    excused or discharged without any indication on the trial record of the reason
    for excusing the juror.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From time to time during the jury selection process,
    some of the communications between the trial judge and the prospective jurors were
    recorded by the court reporter.  However,
    many were not recorded or summarized on the trial record.  The Crown acknowledges that the appellant was
    unable to hear the “private conversations” that went on between the trial judge
    and the prospective jurors.    </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(b) The Arguments</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that the conversations
    between the trial judge and some of the prospective jurors were part of his trial.  He submits that because he could not hear
    those conversations, he was effectively denied the right to be present at that
    part of his trial.  He contends that this
    denial contravened s. 650 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, which provides that he is entitled to be present throughout his trial.  The appellant further submits that the
    absence of any record of the conversations between the trial judge and the
    prospective juror compromised his ability to demonstrate the prejudice flowing
    from his exclusion from those conversations.  He argues that prejudice resulting in a miscarriage of justice must be
    assumed in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown does not argue that the conversations
    were not part of the trial.  She submits,
    however, that the conversations which related exclusively to matters that would
    justify excusing a prospective juror under s. 632 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> did not affect the “vital interests” of the appellant.  She submits that as the appellant’s “vital
    interests” were not at stake, his failure to hear the conversations did not
    result in a denial of his right to be present at his trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Alternatively, Crown counsel submits that if the
    accused was denied the right to be present at trial, that error, in these
    circumstances, constitutes a “procedural irregularity” that occasioned no
    prejudice to the appellant.  She relies
    on s. 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the “procedural curative proviso” to support her
    submission that the appeal should be dismissed.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(c)  Analysis</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 650(1) provides that an accused “shall
    be present in court during the whole of his or her trial.”  In <i>R.
    v. Barrow</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694, the majority held that a trial judge’s
    questioning of prospective jurors on issues relevant to potential partiality
    constituted part of the trial for the purposes of s. 650 (then s. 577).  In <i>Barrow</i>,
    as in this case, the questioning took place after arraignment and plea in the
    courtroom and out of the earshot of the accused.  In <i>Barrow</i>,
    unlike this case, the trial judge also excluded counsel from the questioning
    and did so over counsel’s express objection.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Barrow</i> predated the enactment of s. 632.  That
    section specifically gives trial judges the power to excuse potential jurors
    for the reasons set out in the section (personal interest in the case,
    relationship with the parties, police, counsel or the judge, personal hardship
    or reasonable cause).  Prior to the
    enactment of s. 632, trial judges routinely followed a procedure like that set
    out in s. 632.  The trial judge in <i>Barrow</i> did so, although it would appear that
    his inquiries into partiality went beyond those contemplated by s. 632.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The opening language of s. 632 specifically
    provides that a trial judge may exercise the powers in that section “before the
    commencement of trial”.  If a trial judge
    did so, s. 650 would not be engaged, although apart entirely from that section,
    I would think that an accused has the right to be present during the process
    envisioned in s. 632.  In this case,
    however, the trial judge chose to arraign the appellant before the jury panel and
    take his plea before the panel prior to exercising his function under s.
    632.  The timing of the trial judge’s
    questioning of the prospective jurors in this case renders it indistinguishable
    on that ground from <i>Barrow</i>.  The questioning of the prospective jurors formed
    part of the appellant’s trial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Barrow</i>,
    at p. 707, also makes it clear that the appellant’s inability to hear the
    conversations between the trial judge and the prospective jurors must be
    equated with his absence from the courtroom during those conversations for the
    purposes of s. 650.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the Crown accepts that the questioning
    of the jury was part of the trial and that the appellant was effectively absent
    from that part of the trial, she argues that not everything that happens in the
    course of the trial will be considered part of the trial for the purposes of s.
    650 and the accused’s right to be present during his or her trial.  She submits that matters that are collateral
    or incidental to the trial itself and do not involve an accused’s “vital
    interests” will not be considered part of the trial for the purposes of s. 650
    even if those events occurred in the course of the conduct of the trial:  <i>R. v. Hertrich </i>(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 537-38, leave to appeal refused,
    [1982] 2 S.C.R. x; <i>R. v. V</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>zina</i>,

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The distinction between things that occur during
    the trial and things that are part of the trial for the purposes of s. 650 is
    alluded to by the majority in <i>Barrow</i>.  Dickson C.J.C. notes at pp. 706-707:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A distinction is drawn in the United States,
    however, between exemptions claimed on grounds of partiality and those claimed
    on essentially private grounds of hardship, illness, and the like.  In the latter instances, the examination by
    the judge has been held to be outside the scope of the trial (citation omitted).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dickson C.J.C. goes on to hold that in <i>Barrow</i>, the judge’s conversations with
    the prospective jurors related in part, at least, to questions of
    partiality.  He said at p. 708: “Any
    question about the partiality of the jurors individually or the jury as a whole
    reflects on the substantive conduct of the trial and must be dealt with in the
    presence of the accused.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I cannot accept that the trial judge’s
    communications with the jurors fall into the category of events that while
    occurring during a trial, do not constitute part of the trial for the purposes
    of s. 650.  The procedures followed by
    the trial judge in excusing potential jurors and discharging selected jurors
    are provided for in ss. 632 and 644(1.1).  In <i>Hertrich</i>, Martin J.A. said
    at p. 527:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, “trial” for the purpose of the principle
    that an accused is entitled to be present at his trial <u>clearly includes
    proceedings which are part of the normal trial process for determining the guilt
    or innocence of the accused such as arraignment and plea, the empanelling of
    the jury</u>, the reception of evidence (including <i>voir dire</i> proceedings with respect to the admissibility of
    evidence), rulings on evidence, arguments of counsel, addresses of counsel to
    the jury, the judge’s charge, including requests by the jury for further
    instructions, the reception of the verdict and imposition of sentence if the
    accused is found guilty.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, if a procedure is “part of the
    normal trial process for determining guilt of innocence” it is unnecessary to
    engage in an <i>ad hoc</i> inquiry as to the
    significance of that procedure to the rights of the accused in any given
    case.  Routine jury selection procedures
    specifically contemplated by the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> are part of the trial for the purposes of s. 650.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also have difficulty with the distinction suggested
    in <i>Barrow</i> between inquiries into a
    juror’s potential partiality and inquiries into “personal reasons” for being
    excused from the jury.  While many of the
    prospective jurors’ problems will be personal in nature, some will raise
    questions of partiality and some will involve both personal matters and questions
    of partiality.  For example, a
    prospective juror may identify a relationship with someone connected with the
    case or with law enforcement more generally and be uncertain as to whether that
    relationship should excuse him from the jury.  In raising the question, the juror is raising the possibility of
    partiality, but may also be raising a personal matter depending on the nature
    of the relationship.  It is difficult and
    dangerous to try and draw a bright line between the different types of questions
    that could arise during an inquiry under either s. 632 or s. 644(1.1.)</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am also satisfied that on the “vital
    interests” test relied on by the Crown the s. 632 and s. 644(1.1) inquiries are
    matters of “vital interests” to the accused.  Section 632 can have a significant impact on the constitution of the
    group of jurors from which the 12 jurors who will try the case will be
    chosen.  Section 644(1.1) has a direct
    impact on the constitution of the jury that tries the case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons set out above, the “private
    conversations” between the trial judge and the jurors were part of the
    appellant’s trial.  Absent waiver, he was
    entitled to hear the conversations between the trial judge and the prospective
    jurors.  The Crown does not suggest that
    the appellant waived his right to be present. </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Section] 686(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(iv) was
    enacted to cure serious procedural irregularities, otherwise amounting to
    errors of law, in cases where under the then existing case law, jurisdiction

    procedural irregularities in issue would have to be serious ones, it is
    appropriate to infer prejudice without requiring in every case that the accused
    demonstrate prejudice.  The inference may
    of course be rebutted and the test for prejudice under that subsection should
    be the same as the no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, under s.

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    s. 686(1)(b)(iv) to situations in which an accused has been improperly excluded
    from part of the trial was recently and thoroughly canvassed by this court in <i>R. v. Simon</i>, 2010 ONCA 754, at paras.
    114-23. <span class=GramE>That</span> case provides a helpful catalogue of the
    factors relevant to the assessment of the prejudice, if any, caused by the
    exclusion of the accused during his trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prejudice in the context of s. 686(1)(b)(iv)
    refers to prejudice to the individual accused’s ability to properly defend
    himself and receive a fair trial and prejudice in the broader sense of
    prejudice to the appearance of the due administration of justice.  I see no prejudice in either sense of the
    word flowing from the appellant’s exclusion from the conversations between the
    prospective jurors and the trial judge.  I reach that conclusion for four reasons. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, with the exception of the first potential
    juror who was questioned by the trial judge, counsel for the appellant was
    privy to all other conversations.  He had
    the opportunity to hear what was said and raise any issues that he felt should
    be raised to protect the interests of his client.  Insofar as the first prospective juror is
    concerned, it is clear that she was excluded because of her pre-paid holiday
    plans. There can be no suggestion that her exclusion in any way prejudiced the
    appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, apart from suggestion that the
    conversations should be recorded, counsel made no objection to the procedure
    followed by the trial judge.   Clearly,
    he could have done so if he thought that the appellant’s inability to hear the
    conversations prejudiced the defence in any way.  Counsel did tell the trial judge that he
    could not hear the conversations and the trial judge immediately remedied that
    problem.  I see no reason to think that
    he would not have done the same had counsel for the appellant indicated that
    there was any problem arising out of the appellant’s inability to hear the
    conversations.  The failure of the defence
    to raise any objection at trial is a significant factor in the prejudice
    assessment:  <i>R. v. Khan</i>, per LeBel J., concurring, at paras. 85-86; <i>Barrow</i>, at p. 717; <i>R. v. Ferguson</i> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 157 (Alta. C.A.), at paras.
    30-31, leave to appeal refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 121.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, there is nothing in the trial record and
    nothing has been offered by way of fresh evidence on appeal that would lend any
    substance to the suggestion that any of the prospective jurors who were excused
    were not properly excused or that anything occurred during those conversations
    which could have possibly prejudiced the appellant.  Nor has the appellant demonstrated any link
    between his inability to hear those conversations and the manner in which his
    counsel exercised the appellant’s preemptory challenges.  In oral argument, counsel for the appellant
    did refer to various exchanges between him and the trial judge during the jury
    selection process.  However, he failed
    entirely to show any connection between those exchanges and any possible
    prejudice to the appellant flowing from his inability to hear the conversations
    between the trial judge and the prospective jurors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth, none of the 12 jurors who actually tried
    the case were involved in any of the private conversations with the trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The four reasons set out above address both
    actual <span class=GramE>prejudice</span> to the appellant and potential
    prejudice to the appearance of justice.  I would add, however, that insofar as the appearance of justice is
    concerned, I think the presence of counsel during the conversations is
    crucial.  To the reasonable observer,
    counsel’s presence ensures that the interests of the appellant are fully
    protected and erases the appearance that the trial judge is engaged in private
    conversations concerning matters that are unknown to the accused.  The presence of counsel during the
    communications with the jurors is what makes this case very different from <i>Barrow</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although I am satisfied that no prejudice
    occurred in this case, I do wish to comment on the procedure followed by the
    trial judge.  He was quite properly
    concerned about the legitimate privacy interests of prospective jurors.  A person called for jury duty should not be
    put in the position of being required to speak publically about very personal
    matters, such as health related issues.  A
    potential juror should be required to share those matters only with those
    persons for whom knowledge of the potential juror’s concerns is necessary to a proper
    jury selection process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge, however, should have ensured
    that his conversations with the prospective jurors were recorded and made part
    of the trial record.  That, of course,
    does not mean that they are available for public consumption.  Recording the conversations enhances the
    transparency of the proceedings and accountability through appellate
    review.  As Chief Justice Dickson said in <i>Barrow</i>, at p. 716, “nothing should be
    done in private in open court”. The trial judge should also have placed a brief
    explanation on the record each time he excused a juror.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The valid privacy concerns of prospective jurors
    cannot trump the trial rights of accused persons, including their right to be
    present at their trial.  For the reasons
    I have set out above, that right includes the right to be present during the
    procedures contemplated by s. 632 and s. 644(1.1).  That said<span class=GramE>,</span> counsel
    and trial judges routinely work out effective procedures to preserve the rights
    of the accused and minimize the intrusion on the privacy interests of
    prospective jurors.  Certainly, no one,
    especially an accused, has any interest in unnecessarily embarrassing or
    aggravating prospective jurors.    </p>
