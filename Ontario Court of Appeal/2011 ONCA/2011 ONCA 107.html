  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual interference of a
    nine-year old developmentally delayed girl.  He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment followed by three years’
    probation.  He appeals from conviction
    and seeks leave to appeal sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the conviction appeal, the appellant argues that the
    verdict is unreasonable.  He also seeks
    to introduce fresh evidence by alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at
    trial.  He says his trial counsel was
    inadequately prepared for trial and inadequately represented him during the two
    day trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He appeals his sentence on the ground that it is
    manifestly unfit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court found it unnecessary to call on the Crown in
    this appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the alleged incident, the complainant
    was nine years old.  She functions at a
    cognitive level some years younger than her actual age.  She and her father and grandmother lived in
    the appellant’s house.  The appellant was
    the grandmother’s boyfriend. He was a truck driver and away from home a
    significant amount of the time. However, the appellant would occasionally look
    after the complainant when her father and grandmother went out to play bingo on
    Friday evenings.  The incident allegedly occurred
    on one such occasion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was sitting on a couch watching
    television.  The appellant sat next to
    her.  He had been drinking.  He touched her hips and then moved his hands
    towards her breasts.  She flicked his
    hands off and told him not to touch her.  She then got up and went to the computer to check her emails.  He came up behind her, put his hands on her
    shoulders and again moved them towards her breasts.  She again flicked his hands off of her and
    told him not to touch her.  Some six
    years after the incident, the complainant disclosed the incident.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial lasted a single day.  Three witnesses, one of whom was the
    complainant, testified.  The appellant
    did not.  The sole issue was credibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to any inconsistencies and
    discrepancies in the complainant’s testimony.  To the extent there was conflicting evidence from the appellant’s
    grandmother on secondary matters such as the location of the computer and the
    ability to access the internet, the trial judge considered the evidence and
    preferred that of the complainant, whom he found to be credible and
    reliable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no merit in the allegation that the verdict was
    unreasonable. The inconsistencies that the appellant raises before this court
    are minor matters. To the extent that the appellant’s submissions flow from the
    suggestion that the complainant’s testimony ought not to have been accepted
    because of her diminished mental capacity and her delay in reporting, we reject
    this submission.  The trial judge gave
    cogent reasons for finding her evidence credible and reliable.  He was entitled to accept that evidence and
    convict on it.  His reasons demonstrate
    that he considered each and every argument advanced by the defence at trial and
    that he carefully analysed those arguments.  He gave full explanations for why he rejected them.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FRESH EVIDENCE APPLICATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We refuse to admit the fresh evidence because, in our
    view, the appellant has not made out his claim of ineffective assistance of
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having considered the fresh evidence, we find that the
    appellant’s trial counsel offers a far more credible and reliable history of
    his interaction with the appellant and that there were good tactical reasons
    for the decisions that he made during the course of the trial.  We also note that the appellant continued to
    retain his trial counsel on a different sexual interference charge after the
    trial in question.  In any event, after
    considering the fresh evidence, we are of the view that there was no
    incompetence on the part of trial counsel and there was no miscarriage of
    justice.       </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the sentence fails to
    reflect the nature of the sexual touching, which was fleeting, isolated and did
    not escalate in seriousness.  Accordingly, he suggests, the sentence was unfit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown acknowledges that the acts in question might
    not normally justify an 18 month sentence of incarceration but says that the
    sentence in this case was fit.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept the Crown’s submission on this matter.  There is no basis on which to interfere with
    the sentence imposed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave detailed, thoughtful reasons for
    sentence, which properly took into account the aggravating factors of this
    offence, the appellant’s long standing predatory history of abusing children to
    whom he stood in a position of trust, and the trial judge’s factual finding
    that this appellant is at a high risk to re-offend.  The appellant was in a position of trust over
    his victim, a young and particularly vulnerable child because of her special
    circumstances.  The psychological impact
    on her has been considerable.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its factum, the Crown had indicated that it would
    ask this court to allow the sentence appeal only to the extent of adding the
    following condition to the 3 year probationary term:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Not to be in the presence of anyone under the age
    of 16 unless   continuously in the
    company of another supervising adult other than Y.L.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown advised the court that she had spoken with
    counsel for the appellant before the oral hearing of the appeal and that he had
    stated that he did not object to the imposition of that additional condition.  The court confirmed with counsel for the
    appellant that he had no objection to the addition of this condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that imposition of this additional
    probationary condition is warranted.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, we dismiss the conviction appeal,
    grant leave to appeal sentence and allow the sentence appeal only to the extent
    of adding the probationary condition in the terms requested by the Crown, as
    set out above.  </p>
