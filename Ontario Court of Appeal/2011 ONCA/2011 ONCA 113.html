  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Mark Allan <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> pled guilty to one count of fraud over $5000. Following his plea, his counsel
    advised the court that he and <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had reviewed
    the Crown’s draft of the facts and were “satisfied that the essence of the count
    that he’s pleaded to will be substantiated by the facts”. The draft that <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> and his counsel had seen was consistent with facts
    that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had already admitted to in an agreement
    he had reached with the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was
    represented at the time he pled guilty, he was unrepresented at his sentencing
    hearing some 19 months later. At that time, he made submissions challenging a
    number of the Crown’s factual assertions. Many of his disagreements directly
    contradicted what he had admitted in his agreement with the OSC; other
    assertions had to do with minimizing his legal liability. In response to
    questions from the trial judge, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> said he
    didn’t believe he was guilty. The trial judge indicated he would not exercise
    his discretion to strike the plea. He held that “[t]he elements of the offence
    pleaded to are clearly apparent” and “[b]y anyone’s arithmetic” <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had perpetrated a massive fraud on the investing
    public and breached the trust of those persons who invested money with him. The
    trial judge sentenced <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> to 8 years’
    imprisonment and ordered him to pay restitution to the victims of the fraud in
    the amount of $35,639,395.05.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> appeals. The issues
    raised in relation to his conviction are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Was the guilty plea valid?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Was <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> right to
    a fair trial infringed because (a) the trial judge did not hear from <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> before deciding he would not strike the plea or (b)
    he did not provide sufficient assistance to <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> when he was unrepresented?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What facts was the trial judge entitled to rely
    on in sentencing <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the conviction appeal. At the time <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> entered his plea, he was represented by experienced
    counsel and so there was a presumption that his plea was valid. For the reasons
    that follow, I would hold that this presumption has not been rebutted, and that
    the trial judge was correct in finding that the plea met the requirements of a
    valid plea, namely that it was voluntary, unequivocal and informed. Having
    regard to the record as a whole, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> has failed
    to convince this court on a balance of probabilities that the plea is invalid
    and should be set aside. I would reject <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> submission that the plea was equivocal in that it was conditional on an agreed
    statement of facts being worked out as well as not informed. The trial judge’s
    decision not to strike <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> plea was a valid
    exercise of his discretion, given the history of the proceedings and the fact
    that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> never asked to withdraw his guilty plea
    although he was aware he could do so. While <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was not represented by counsel at the sentencing hearing, the hearing was fair.
    Furthermore, although <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> took issue with certain
    facts, the facts that were undisputed satisfy every element of the offence of
    fraud, and his disagreements with how the Crown characterized the facts do not
    affect his legal liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I next address <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> application
    for leave to appeal his sentence. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> primary
    contention is that the restitution order should be quashed because the trial
    judge did not consider his ability to pay restitution. In addition, he submits
    that the order was disproportionate to his involvement in the fraudulent scheme
    as he transferred $17.6 million to his deceased co-accused. Finally, <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that the trial judge failed to consider
    whether, having regard to <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> sentence of
    imprisonment, the overall sentence was fit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would agree with these submissions. Given the trial
    judge’s errors in principle, I would hold that the restitution order is
    excessive, that it renders the overall sentence unfit and that it must be set
    aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It therefore falls to this court to decide whether, as
    part of a fit sentence, a restitution order is appropriate and, if so, in what
    amount. For the reasons that follow, I would hold that a restitution order is
    appropriate. I would, however, vary the amount of the restitution order to $20
    million. This figure reflects <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> degree of
    criminal responsibility in a massive fraud that involved a significant breach of
    trust. It also reflects both the funds that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> transferred offshore whose disposition is unaccounted for and amounts that <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> admits to taking as ‘income’.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the validity of <span class=SpellE>Eizenga's</span> guilty plea, I have considered the background to the plea, the record of the
    court proceedings both on September 27, 2005, and when the plea was entered on
    November 4, 2005, and the lengthy history that followed. That history includes <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> statement to the author of his pre-sentence
    report that he “accepts responsibility for the offence as he was in charge of
    the company.” The pre-sentence report is dated June 5, 2007, a week before <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> sentencing hearing on June 12, 2007, at which he
    disputed many of the Crown’s allegations. For the sake of completeness a
    summary of these events is detailed below.</p>
  <h4><i><span

    September 1998, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> and James Edward Sylvester (“James
    Sylvester”) were jointly charged on May 8, 2003, with one count of fraud
    exceeding $5000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, and one count of theft over $5000 contrary to s. 334
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.<span

lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fraud and theft charges arose out of

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The Saxton Group encompassed a large network of related companies that included
    at least: (1) 34 offering corporations that sold securities to the public; (2)
    Saxton Investments Ltd. (“Saxton Investments”), the main managing entity; (3) Saxton
    LMD, a private company owned by <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> and his wife,
    Lisa; and (4) various Cuban businesses operating under the name Sussex Admiral
    Group Limited (later Sussex Group Ltd.), of which <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was once president. Overall, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> incorporated at
    least 40 corporations in Ontario and two in the Bahamas. The Saxton Group’s
    core business was the development and manufacturing of beverage and food
    products in Cuba and elsewhere the Caribbean.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Saxton Group marketed and sold shares in the
    offering corporations to the investing public, improperly exploiting the “seed
    capital” prospectus exemption so that Saxton would not have to give full
    disclosure of information to investors. Saxton misrepresented these shares to
    investors as “GICs”, “Fixed Dividend Accounts” and “Equity Dividend Accounts”,
    suggesting they were low-risk investments when they were not. Although the
    investors had to sign a subscription agreement which had a clause acknowledging
    that they had received and reviewed an Offering Memorandum, very few of them
    ever received one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The money that was raised by the offering
    corporations was transferred to Saxton Investments. The funds were pooled and
    then diverted, directly or indirectly, to the Cuban and other offshore
    operations; some money was also diverted to Saxton LMD. Personal real estate,
    automobiles, and other assets that were owned or enjoyed by <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> and his family were paid for by either Saxton Investments or Saxton LMD
    cheques.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Investors were promised a high rate of return;
    however, there is no evidence that the Saxton Group ever made enough profit
    from its Caribbean operations to meet that rate of return. When investors
    redeemed their investment or realized their interest, it was taken directly
    from the funds that other investors had put in.</p>

    he and Crown counsel intended to negotiate an agreed statement of facts. Mr. <span

    the transcript with the view to consider whether there was a basis in law to
    strike the plea that was entered in 2005, and (b) arriving at an agreed
    statement of facts with the Crown if an application to strike the plea was
    unsuccessful. She explained that she was not retained to assist in a <i>Gardiner</i> hearing or to deal with any issues regarding aggravating factors in the
    statement of facts that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> disputed. <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> confirmed the scope of her retainer in court. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Chiodo</span> also advised that she had not received all the transcripts yet and that <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was not in a position to agree to anything in the
    Crown’s statement of facts. Crown counsel advised the court that if the parties
    could not come to an agreed statement of facts, then they might have to proceed
    to a <i>Gardiner</i> hearing. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Chiodo</span> then stated that she would be content to
    continue discussions with the Crown in order to arrive at an agreed statement
    of facts, but if that did not happen by the next court appearance, then she would
    bring an application to strike the plea. The matter was adjourned to January

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on March 2, 2007, Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Petrouchinova</span> appeared in court again on behalf of Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Chiodo</span>. She advised that there had been a significant
    breakdown in communication between Ms. <span class=SpellE>Chiodo</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span>, “which has not made it possible for her to receive
    the significant input she requires on the agreed statement of facts.” Ms. <span

class=SpellE>Chiodo</span> had not received any input from <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span>,
    could not proceed in any fashion, and therefore requested that she be removed
    as counsel of record. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> then stated in court
    that since Ms. <span class=SpellE>Chiodo</span> was not retained to represent
    him in a <i>Gardiner</i> hearing, it was
    understandable that she be removed as counsel of record. The trial judge granted
    the application to remove Ms. <span class=SpellE>Chiodo</span> from the record,
    set the matter over to another date for facts and sentence, and ordered a
    pre-sentence report to be prepared.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel then advised the court that when he and
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> were negotiating the agreed statement of
    facts, the statement had been “distilled from a 150 page document down to about
    a 40 page document”. He advised the court that on November 1, 2005, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Trudell</span> told him that he would send the defence’s proposed
    changes to the Crown; <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> would then get
    independent legal advice once the agreed facts are “complete”. On January 20,
    2006, Crown counsel sent back a copy of the agreed statement of facts incorporating
    “all<i> </i>the changes that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Trudell</span> had requested on <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> behalf.” The Crown did not hear back until March 21, 2006, when Mr. <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown took the position that there had been an
    agreed statement of facts between the parties in March 2006. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Trudell’s</span> correspondence in November 2005 meant that he was
    going to send <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> out for independent legal
    advice only when the facts were agreed upon. The Crown submitted that when Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Trudell</span> told him on March 21, 2006, that <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was now looking for independent legal advice, it
    implied that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had agreed to the version of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reply, Crown counsel noted that many of <span

    to what he had previously admitted to in the OSC Settlement Agreement. In
    particular, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had admitted that he directed the
    implementation of the business plan at the Saxton Group, that he controlled the
    money, that there were no financial statements or record of any revenue
    generation, that Saxton operated at a loss, and that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> continued to solicit investors and distribute securities after failing to

    and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> had negotiated the statement of facts
    that was read into the record, and that the Crown had incorporated all the
    changes that the defence wanted. The Crown submitted that the version that was
    forwarded to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> can be assumed to be an
    agreed statement of facts, and that it was not open for <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> to now retract those facts nor back away from the admissions he made in the OSC

    trial judge inquired further, and <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> stated, “I

    whether or not to strike the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> plea. The
    Crown reminded the court that the Crown’s statement of facts was consistent
    with much of what <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> admitted to in his

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He held that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> disagreement over the Crown’s statement of facts was “nothing more than the
    extreme rationalization and an obvious self-serving interpretation” that was
    contradicted by the settlement agreement that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had entered into with the Ontario Securities Commission. The trial judge quoted
    large portions of the OSC Settlement Agreement and found that the agreement was
    consistent with the Crown’s statement of facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge noted that the Crown alleged
    that the fraud encompassed $40 million from 799 investors and <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> alleged that the true amount was $37 million from
    no more than 400 investors. The trial judge held that, in any case, “[b]y
    anyone’s arithmetic this was a massive fraud” on the investing public and a
    major breach of trust. He held: “The elements of the offence pleaded to are
    clearly apparent.” The trial judge noted that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> never brought an application before the court to strike or question the guilty
    plea. Indeed, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had stated that he “feels
    guilty” and was sorry for the loss to investors.</p>

class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> plea was involuntary. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was present in court and pled guilty. He did not express any disagreement when
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> informed the court that <span

    fraud charge. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> has not filed an affidavit as
    fresh evidence that any discussions off the record rendered his plea
    involuntary, nor does he submit that he was under any disability which affected
    the voluntariness of his plea. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> was a very
    experienced defence lawyer and the appellant makes no claim of ineffective

    to the requirement of voluntariness, s. 606(1.1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> states that a court may accept a plea of guilty only
    if it is satisfied that the accused understands he or she is admitting to the
    essential elements of the offence and the nature and consequences of the plea.
    In other words the plea must be informed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To assist the court in coming to a conclusion that an <span

    a statement of alleged facts to justify the plea that has been entered and ask
    the accused to admit that those facts are substantially correct: <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Corkum</span> </i>(1984),
    64 A.R. 354 (C.A.). However, this procedure is not required by s. 606. In fact,
    s. 606(1.2) provides that the omission of the court to enquire into whether the
    accused understands that he or she is admitting to the essential elements of
    the offence and understands the nature and consequences of his or her plea does
    not affect the plea’s validity. Thus in the case at bar, the Crown’s failure to
    read in an agreed statement of alleged facts and to obtain <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> admission that those facts were substantially correct at the time he pled
    guilty did not, in and of itself, affect the validity of his plea.</p>

    the statement of facts would be as <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> wanted it.
    Indeed, the parties had always contemplated that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> may contest the facts at the sentencing hearing. At the court appearance on
    September 27, 2005, in <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> presence, Mr. <span

    statement of facts was only an aspiration to be worked on by counsel after the
    plea was entered:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. TRUDELL: My friend
    [Crown counsel Mr. Forrester] and I and my associates will work diligently
    between now and then starting this afternoon on a statement of facts that will
    assist the Court. <i>We hope that it becomes
    an agreed statement of facts</i> and we’re going to be working towards that.
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> has indicated to me that his intention is
    to plead guilty – is that correct sir?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>EIZENGA: Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. TRUDELL: He’s indicating “yes” for the record.
    ... So I’m asking that it go to November 4th, plea will be entered on that day, <i>facts will be put before you on that day

    he pled guilty, he was properly informed and fully understood the nature of the
    fraud charge. Before <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> entered his plea, the
    charges were read to him. When an accused personally enters a plea, as <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> did in this case, it tends to demonstrate the
    unequivocal character of the plea: see<i> R.

    infer that counsel took the necessary steps to ensure that his client
    understood the nature and consequences of a guilty plea.  See <span class=SpellE><i>Eastmond</i></span> at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 6-7; <i>R. v. Dallaire</i>, <span class=ssl2>[</span>2001]

style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:200%'>, </span></span>as indicated earlier, the
    Crown’s allegation of fraud largely reflected <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> agreement with the OSC. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was certainly
    informed. At the time of his plea on November 4, 2005, he knew the Crown’s
    position on the facts; he was also aware that, in response to his request,
    changes to some of the details were being worked out between the Crown and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Trudell</span>, who was acting as his agent. On November 4, 2005,
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> stated that he would send the defence’s
    proposed changes to the Crown. When Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> delivered
    these proposed changes to the Crown, Crown counsel sent back a copy of the
    agreed statement of facts on January 20, 2006, incorporating all<i> </i>the changes that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Trudell</span> had requested on <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> behalf. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was then sent to get independent
    legal advice. Although <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was aware that he
    could bring a motion to strike his plea, he never did so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> sentencing hearing on June 12, 2007, the sentencing judge commented that the
    purpose of allowing <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> to obtain independent
    legal advice was not in relation to the guilty plea or the agreed statement of
    facts but to Canada Revenue Agency issues. In effect, the trial judge was
    saying that his original understanding that the plea was unequivocal was confirmed
    by correspondence between the Crown and defence as to the purpose for obtaining
    legal advice. Assuming that there was no evidence before the court as to the
    purpose for which <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was sent for independent
    legal advice, there was no evidence that the purpose was to confirm the guilty
    plea. The presumption that the plea was unequivocal would therefore apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my opinion, however, nothing turns on the
    purpose for which <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was sent for further legal
    advice. The fact that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> sought and obtained
    further legal advice means that he was aware of the contents of the document
    that had been worked out. . While <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> would have
    us infer that he expressed disagreement to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> respecting the document, there is no evidence supporting this inference. Nor
    did he bring a motion to strike his plea although he was aware that this was
    one of his options.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of a plea of guilt entered with an
    indication that an agreed statement of facts is to come is discussed in <i>R. v. Newman</i> (1993),<i> </i>12 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.).<span class=verdana> </span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> As in the case at bar, the appellant’s contention in <i>Newman</i> was that there was no consensus between himself and the
    Crown as to the scope and reach of the facts to which the guilty plea applied. The
    only issue was whether the plea was informed. In effect, the court placed the
    onus on the appellant of establishing two things: (1) that he did not
    appreciate the consequences of the actions of his trial counsel, and (2) that
    despite pleading guilty he did not accept as accurate a necessary factual
    foundation for the offence. The court held at p. 487:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the
    appellant was deprived of the effective right to counsel, and if we were
    satisfied that his plea of guilty embraced a factual foundation that he was not
    prepared to accept for the purposes of the sentencing procedures, it would be a
    matter of concern to this court, with or without the <i>Charter</i>. If we were of the view that the sentencing procedures were
    so unsatisfactory that the appellant was deprived of a fair trial and the
    result was unreliable because the accused did not accept the agreed statement
    of facts as accurate, then the obvious remedy is to permit the appellant to
    withdraw his plea of guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the court was not persuaded that there was
    any lack of competence on the part of counsel for the accused. The court
    further held that an evidentiary threshold must be met in order to set aside a
    plea of guilt and the accused had failed to meet it. The court stated at pp.
    490-91:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[H]e would
    have to swear that he would not have pleaded guilty to such a statement of
    facts had it been available to him prior to his plea. I think that the
    appellant was simply trying to improve on his situation…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> does not meet either
    of the two criteria articulated by the Court of Appeal in <i>Newman </i>for setting aside a guilty plea. First, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> makes no allegation that he was deprived of the effective assistance of
    counsel. Second, the evidentiary threshold required to set aside his plea of
    guilt has not been met. He has not filed an affidavit as fresh evidence stating
    that he would not have pled guilty to the agreed statement of facts put forward
    by the Crown had it been available to him prior to his plea, nor does the
    record support such an assertion. I would add that an <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> bald assertion that he or she did not have a full understanding of the nature
    of the charges and consequences of entering a guilty plea will not suffice to
    set aside a guilty plea when it is not supported by the circumstances and the <span
class=SpellE>accused’s</span> subsequent actions: see <i>R. v. T.(R.).</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence which <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> has put forward illustrates the requirements in <i>Newman. </i>Negligent or improper conduct on the part of counsel for
    the accused is at the heart of four of the seven decisions cited by <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> in which the court permitted a guilty plea to be
    withdrawn. In<i> R. v. <span class=SpellE>Yarlasky</span></i> (2005), 195 O.A.C. 188 (C.A.), defence counsel recommended a guilty plea and
    did not tell the accused that she had a possible defence to the charge against
    her. In<i> R. v. N.C.</i> (2001), 151 O.A.C.
    249 (C.A.), the accused was charged with sexual interference; however, his counsel
    did not explain to him that by pleading guilty to inappropriately touching his
    granddaughter, <span class=verdana>he was admitting that his touching </span>had
    a sexual purpose, a necessary element to the offence charged against him.
    Similarly, in<i> R. v. Mitchell</i> (1997), 97
    O.A.C. 69 (C.A.), counsel did not explain the elements of intimidation to the
    accused prior to advising him to plead guilty. In<i> R. v. <span class=SpellE>Lamoureux</span> </i>(1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d)
    101 (Que. C.A.), the appellant’s counsel pressured him to plead guilty. In a
    fifth decision,<i> R. v. <span class=SpellE>Rajaeefard</span> </i>(1996), <span class=ssl2>27 O.R. (3d) 323</span> (C.A.), the trial judge
    improperly pressured the accused to plead guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case before us, however, is distinguishable in that
    ineffective assistance of counsel is not alleged and there was no pressure by
    the trial judge on <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> to plead guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cases put forward by <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> to illustrate the second requirement, that there be a credible evidentiary
    basis on which to set aside the plea, are also distinguishable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Yarlasky</span></i> (1999), <span class=ssl2>140 C.C.C. (3d) 281
    (Ont. C.A.), </span>the accused pled guilty to defrauding a town of monies by
    failing to disclose a change of address which would have disentitled her to the
    benefits received. Immediately after her plea she added that she did not pick
    up the cheque intentionally and that she had not had the chance to change her
    address. The Court of Appeal allowed the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> appeal
    on the basis that her plea was not unequivocal and could not stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, during the many months following <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> plea of guilty, he was well aware of the
    statement of facts that had been worked out between the Crown and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Trudell</span>. Although <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> considered bringing a motion to strike his guilty plea as Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Chiodo</span>, who succeeded Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> as counsel, confirmed in open court, he did not do so. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> chose not to pursue an option he knew he had. Indeed, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> comment to the author of the pre-sentence report a week before his sentencing
    hearing indicates that he accepted responsibility for his crime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. K. (S.)</i> (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 199 (C.A.), the accused pled guilty but had always
    maintained his innocence to the charges against him and steadfastly did so
    afterwards. That is not this case here. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> admitted his guilt to the OSC and never refuted the veracity of the admissions
    made in the OSC Settlement Agreement. It was only at his sentencing hearing on
    June 12, 2007, that he made some submissions that contradicted the agreement.
    Even then, he did not say that his admissions to the OSC were untrue or explain
    why he was now taking a contrary position on the facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that the

    way. Quite apart from the fact that the Crown’s statement of facts had incorporated
    all the changes that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> and his counsel had put
    forward, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> admission to certain facts at the
    sentencing hearing are sufficient to ground his guilty plea regardless of
    whether the OSC Settlement Agreement can be used in court (see below, “The
    Undisputed Facts on which <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was Sentenced”).
    However, I will summarily address <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> four
    submissions relating to the OSC Settlement Agreement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that he did not adopt the settlement
    agreement as a statement made by him but by both him and others for the
    purposes of settlement. However, most of the facts given in the agreement speak
    specifically to <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> personal actions and
    misrepresentations that he personally made. He therefore cannot be said to be making
    these statements on behalf of others.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> points out
    that the OSC Settlement Agreement contains an explicit proviso that the facts
    contained in the agreement are admitted for the purposes of the OSC proceedings
    and not any other proceeding. I note that clause 47 of the OSC Settlement
    Agreement also forbids <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> from making “any
    public statement inconsistent with this settlement agreement.” Clearly,
    statements made in open court at a sentencing hearing are public statements. I also
    note that on a number of points <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> provides no
    explanation as to why his position on the facts now contradicts his position in
    the OSC Settlement Agreement. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The agreement contained an exculpatory
    paragraph which appellant’s counsel characterizes as describing <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> intentions as well meaning and his actions as
    unintentional. The appellant’s counsel submits in his factum that the OSC
    Settlement Agreement contained an exculpatory paragraph that described <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> role as well meaning and his consequences as
    unintentional. However, he fails to cite which paragraph in the agreement this
    was. I can find no paragraph that can be described as exculpatory in this
    fashion. To the contrary, the OSC Settlement Agreement, read as a whole, leaves
    the inference <span class=SpellE>Eizenga<b>’</b>s</span> actions were intentional.  In any case,
    the law with respect to fraud is that the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> belief that the conduct is not wrong or that no one will be hurt in the end
    affords no defence to a fraud charge. See <i>R.
    v. <span class=SpellE>Théroux</span></i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that
    because the OSC has broad investigative powers to protect the public, such as
    the authority to compel testimony under oath, any evidence arising out of an
    exercise of the OSC’s powers should be inadmissible at a criminal proceeding
    and therefore <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> settlement agreement cannot
    be used in any way.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

'>[4]</span></span></span></a> This is a generic overbroad submission. The question of how<i> </i>an agreement can be evidence derived from the exercise of the
    OSC’s powers is not answered by <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> bald
    submission that the settlement agreement was a product of his “compelled
    cooperation” with the OSC. The agreement was signed by <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> and witnessed by his counsel. Apart from <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> bald submission, there is no evidence on the record to the contrary. The
    agreement was evidence of <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> prior agreement
    to certain facts, was used by him as the basis for his submissions and forms
    part of the evidentiary record respecting the validity of his guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would hold that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> has
    not discharged his burden of rebutting the presumption that his plea was
    unequivocal and informed.</p>
  <h4><i><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would also hold that the proceedings were fair.
    At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge provided <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> with adequate assistance as a self-represented litigant, and his decision not
    to engage in a further plea inquiry is of no import because overall the plea
    was valid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The assistance a trial judge is obligated to
    provide to a self-represented litigant is part of a trial judge’s larger duty
    to ensure that an accused person receives a fair trial. How far a trial judge
    needs to go in assisting an accused must be determined contextually, having
    regard to the nature of the charges, the sophistication of the litigant,
    whether the litigant has expressed a desire for assistance, the stage of the
    proceedings and the overall circumstances of the case. The overall question to
    be answered is whether the proceedings were fair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> alleges that
    the trial judge ought to have: (1) explained the meaning of a valid plea to him;
    (2) informed him that he had the right to lead evidence and make submissions;
    and (3) heard from <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> before concluding that he
    would not allow the plea to be withdrawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My response to the first two submissions is: (1) <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had legal counsel at the time he entered his
    plea and there is nothing on the record to support the submission that he did
    not understand the meaning of his plea; and (2) <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was told at his court appearance on March 2, 2007, that he would have the
    opportunity to oppose the facts as read in by the Crown and he availed himself
    of that opportunity at the sentencing hearing on June 12, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The third submission, namely that the trial
    judge ought to have heard from <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> before closing
    the door on his inquiry into the plea, requires more elaboration. In the
    absence of special circumstances, there are strong policy reasons for
    dismissing an accused person’s request to withdraw a guilty plea when the
    appropriate time for making such a request has clearly passed and there is no
    indication that the plea was invalid. A guilty plea is a waiver of the <span
class=SpellE>accused’s</span> right to a trial: <span class=SpellE><i>Korponay</i></span><i> v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,<i> </i>[1982] 1 S.C.R. 41, at p. 49; <i>R. v.
    T.(R.).</i> at p. 519. The Crown stops devoting resources to the file and the
    evidence is no longer fresh. In the absence of special circumstances, it would
    be prejudicial to the public’s interest in certainty, finality and the
    expeditious resolution of criminal matters to allow an accused to withdraw his
    plea: see <i>R. v. Duong</i>, 2006 BCCA 325,
    at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 9-10.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here the special circumstances alleged are <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> dispute with some of the facts in the agreed
    statement of facts. As discussed below, the trial judge did not err in
    concluding that there were sufficient undisputed facts to support each element
    of the offence of fraud and, as a result, the validity of the plea is not in
    doubt. As this court stated in <i>R. v.
    T.(R.) </i>at p. 525, “It would hardly serve the interests of justice to quash
    the convictions and permit the withdrawal of the guilty pleas based on an
    inadequate inquiry in the validity of the pleas at trial when, after a full
    inquiry in this court, their validity was established.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> did not ask
    the trial judge to withdraw his plea.<i> </i>Assuming
    that the trial judge ought to have heard from <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> before deciding to end his self-initiated inquiry into the plea, the
    proceedings that followed established the validity of the guilty plea. Overall, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> right to a fair trial was not infringed.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent advises that the statement of facts that
    the Crown filed as an exhibit on March 2, 2007, and read into the record at the
    sentencing hearing on June 12, 2007, was an Agreed Statement of Facts that
    Crown trial counsel and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Trudell</span> had negotiated
    (“ASF”). Also within the exhibits is a document filed by <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span>,
    titled, “Changes for the Disputed ASF With Supporting Documentation” (“the
    Changes Document”). The contents of this document details <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> point-by-point disagreements with the ASF.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> wrote in the preamble
    of the Changes Document, “There are many points [in the ASF] that contain
    transactions that I do not contest, but the interpretations and
    characterizations of the factual transactions are not true.” In the Changes
    Document, if he agreed with a paragraph in the ASF he put OK beside it. For
    some paragraphs of the ASF, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> partially agreed
    with the facts but added some qualifications. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> oral submissions at the sentencing hearing on June 12, 2007, largely echo what
    he expressed in the Changes Document.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=verdana>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge heard submissions from both

    elements of the offence pleaded to are clearly apparent.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have compared the ASF with both <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> statements in the Changes Document and the transcript of his submissions at the
    sentencing hearing. My review of these submissions and the record as a whole leads
    me to the same conclusion as the trial judge, namely that there were still
    enough undisputed facts to satisfy every element of the fraud offence to which <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> pled.</p>

    was sent out on June 30, 1998, when <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was
    Chairman of the Board and majority shareholder. The total value of the “Opening

    column showed the increase in market value over the quarterly period:
    $1,760,542.98. The final column showed the new market value of the investments,
    at $45,109,528.80. The quarterly statement therefore suggested a 3.95% increase
    in value over the course of the quarterly period, or an annual rate of 15.81%. However,
    there were no financial records of any revenue generation by the Saxton
    operations, and thus no means to establish the net results given in these
    quarterly statements. The increase was calculated by a computer at an interest
    rate that the investors had been promised. (At sentencing, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> did not dispute the numbers of the last quarterly statement, or that it was delivered
    to investors. His only disagreement was that he had control over sending out the
    quarterly statements. He claimed that he was just 1 of 6 board members, and
    that he had limited duties and no voting rights. He also claimed that some
    divisions of Saxton were profitable.) (ASF <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 62,

    misrepresentations to investors:</p>

    was “not meant to be misleading” because <span class=SpellE>Optimax</span> Securities Corporation, the company from which he was getting the gold <span

    however, that the letters from <span class=SpellE>Optimax</span> Securities
    Corporation that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> filed as exhibits at the
    sentencing hearing clearly state that the interest was in “gold <span
class=SpellE>dore</span>”). In any case, it was not disputed that <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was aware that Saxton did not have an interest in
    actual gold, and that he did not attempt to clarify this with his sales
    representatives. (ASF 78-82, 152)</p>

    went directly back into “operations”. Of the $23 million, $17.6 million was
    transferred from Saxton Investments to a company owned by his deceased

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> disagreements with
    the ASF, as expressed in the Changes Document and in his oral submissions at
    the sentencing hearing, can be grouped into five broad categories: (1) he acted
    on the legal advice of his lawyers; (2) he believed that no one would be hurt
    by his conduct; (3) some of the investors’ funds went into a legitimate
    operating business in Cuba that made money; (4) the corporate entity did the acts
    in question and not him personally; and (5) he was entitled to withdraw
    personal income from the corporations. None of these disagreements draw into
    question the validity of his guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it was not open to <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> to advance what amounts to a mistake of law defence based on the legal advice
    that he received. It is well established that reliance on legal advice is a
    mistake of law which affords no defence to the commission of an offence: <span
class=bold><i>R. v. Pea</i> (2008), 93 O.R.
    (3d) 67 (C.A.), at para. 17; <i>R. v. Pontes</i>,
    [1995] 3 S.C.R. 44, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 33-34;</span> <span
class=bold><i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Kotch</span></i> (1990), </span><span class=ssl2>61 C.C.C. (3d) 132 (Alta. C.A.), at </span><span

    to appeal discontinued at <span class=ssl2>[</span><span class=hit>2009]
    S.C.C.A. No. 186. </span>Thus, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> reliance on
    legal advice concerning the use of the seed capital exemption or the RRSP
    eligibility of the investments was no defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was in the
    business of finance and received an education in the area, his bald assertions—for
    example, he claims that he did not know investors would be misled into thinking
    GICs were guaranteed by the CDIC like the ones sold by banks across Canada—have
    no air of reality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> assertion that
    he believed that no one would be hurt by his conduct is no defence, because a
    subjective intent to mislead is not an essential element of the offence of
    fraud. Instead, all that is required is subjective knowledge of the prohibited
    act, and that the act could have as a consequence the deprivation of another. In <span class=SpellE><i>Théroux</i></span> and <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Zlatic</span></i>, <span class=ssl2>[1993] 2 S.C.R. 29,</span> the Supreme Court of Canada
    considered the essential elements of fraud under s. 380(1)(a) of th<i>e Criminal Code.</i> The Court held that th<i>e <span class=SpellE>actus</span> <span
class=SpellE>reus</span> </i>of fraud is established by proof of: (1) the
    prohibited act, be it an act of deceit, a falsehood or some other fraudulent
    means; and (2) deprivation caused by the prohibited act, which may consist in
    actual loss or the placing of the victim’s pecuniary interests at risk. What
    constitutes a lie, deceitful act, or other fraudulent act is judged on the
    objective facts by reference to what a reasonable <span style='line-height:200%'>p</span>erson would consider a dishonest act: <span
class=SpellE><i>Théroux</i></span> at p. 16.
    With respect to the <span class=SpellE><i>mens</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>rea</span></i>, the
    Court specifically rejected a definition that required subjective awareness of
    dishonesty and a belief that actual deprivation (as opposed to risk of
    deprivation) will result. The Court held at pp. 23: “[T]he <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> belief that the conduct is not wrong or that no one will in the end be hurt
    affords no defence to a charge of fraud.” Recklessness as to the consequences
    of the prohibited act also attracts criminal responsibility: <span
class=SpellE><i>Théroux</i></span> at p. 20.
    Furthermore, subjective awareness can be inferred from the act itself, barring
    some explanation casting doubt on such inference: <span class=SpellE><i>Théroux</i></span> at p. 18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the view of a reasonable person, <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> acts described above were dishonest. <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> subjective awareness of the consequences can be
    inferred from the acts themselves. At the very least they disclose a recklessness
    as to how his representations would be perceived by investors. These
    misrepresentations led to the deprivation of hundreds o<span style='line-height:200%'>f</span> investors who transferred their money to Saxton
    in the mistaken belief that their investments were safe, when they were not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, at the sentencing hearing <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> filed various documentary exhibits that detailed what happened to Saxton’s
    Cuban operations (<i>i.e.</i> Sussex Group
    Ltd.) after he left Saxton in 1998. In 2002, the court appointed an Interim
    Manager, <span class=SpellE>Horwath</span> Orenstein Consultants Inc. (“HOCI”),
    to oversee a restructuring of Sussex Group Ltd. By 2006, pursuant to directions
    from the court, HOCI had sold off most of Sussex Group <span class=SpellE>Ltd.’s</span> assets and seemed to be preparing a wind-up of the company. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that these documents showed that Sussex Group Ltd.<i> </i>“continued to operate as a profitable business”. He argues that
    the Saxton Group’s Cuban operations were “not a <span class=SpellE>Ponzi</span> scheme”, that the funds from Saxton’s investors “were neither exhausted nor
    lost” and therefore that “[t]he basis for the guilty plea did not exist.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject these submissions. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> assertion that the Saxton Group had invested money in Sussex Group Ltd. in
    Cuba, and that—years after <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> had committed the
    alleged fraud—Sussex Group Ltd. was profitable under the direction of a
    court-appointed interim manager does not absolve him of the fraud charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even apart from the fact that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> assertions that Saxton investors’ funds can all be traced to Sussex Group Ltd.
    is belied by the Interim Manager’s report<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> if an accused uses deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means to deprive a
    victim of property or places the victim’s pecuniary interests at risk,  what the accused later does with the
    victim’s  property is immaterial  to </p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=ParaNO>the determination that fraud has been committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> admitted to at sentencing confirm that he made misrepresentations and committed
    various acts of deceit in order to induce investors into giving him their
    money. He lied about the nature of Saxton’s financial products and the risks
    associated with them. He gave investors the false impression that they were
    putting their savings into safe and insured investments. They extended their
    money to Saxton and suffered very real losses. Nothing that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> has said with respect to Sussex Group Ltd. draws into question whether the
    facts he has admitted to substantiate the elements of fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> fourth type of
    disagreement with the Crown’s facts is that he is not personally liable for the
    actions of the corporate entities. However, this submission is premised on the
    mistaken belief that the corporate veil cannot be pierced. It is well
    established that the court will not enforce the separate legal status of a
    corporation if to do so would be <span class=documentbody>too flagrantly
    opposed to justice:</span> <span class=SpellE><i>Kosmopoulos</i></span><i> v.
    Constitution Insurance Co.</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 2, at p. 10. More particularly, <span class=documentbody>the courts will disregard the separate legal
    personality of a corporate entity where it is completely dominated and
    controlled and being used as a shield for fraudulent or improper conduct: </span><span
class=bold><i>Transamerica Life Insurance
    Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</i> (1996), </span><span class=hit>28
    O.R. (3d) 423 (Ct. (Gen. Div.)), at pp. 433-434. Hence, where the accused is
    the directing mind of a corporate entity and uses the corporation to commit
    fraudulent acts, as in the present case, </span>the court will not hesitate to
    pierce the corporate veil. See e.g. <span class=SpellE><i>Théroux</i></span> at pp. 11-12; <i>R.
    v. Guay</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 3494 (S.C.), at para. 72.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> argues that
    pursuant to corporate by-laws and agreements he had with the Saxton companies,
    he was entitled to use the funds he had obtained from investors by fraudulent
    misrepresentation. He also argues that the funds were so comingled with
    legitimate business funds that they lost their identity. These submissions are
    not based on any legal authority and fly in the face of common sense. <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> cannot use the manner in which the money was
    processed to get around the fact that he benefitted personally from the illegal
    scheme he devised. The individual investors’ funds did not have to be traced. <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> misrepresentations caused investors who trusted
    him to lose their money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was entitled to reject <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> submissions as to the legal effect of his acts
    and to characterize those submissions as nothing more than extreme
    rationalization and a self-serving interpretation of the facts. There is no
    credible evidentiary basis for the appellant’s submission that there is reason
    to doubt <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> guilt on any essential element of
    the charge. As in<i> Newman</i>,<i> </i>I am of the opinion that at the time of
    his sentencing hearing, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> was simply trying to
    improve on his situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons I have given I would dismiss the appeal

    assist the court in determining whether a trial judge has taken all relevant
    factors into account and whether the sentence is fit and proper. The absence of
    specific reasons for making a restitution order may lead to the conclusion that
    the restitution order was imposed as a mechanical afterthought to the sentence
    of imprisonment and that the overall sentence amounts to excessive punishment.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that the

    a relevant factor, namely his ability to pay restitution, and the amount
    ordered undermines his prospects for rehabilitation. In addition, <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that the order was disproportionate to his
    involvement in the fraudulent scheme as he transferred $17.6 million to the
    deceased co-accused James Sylvester. Finally, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submits that the trial judge failed to consider whether, having regard to his

    regard to the trial judge’s errors in principle, I would hold that the
    restitution order is excessive, that it renders the overall sentence unfit and
    that it must be set aside. I must, however, go on to consider whether, as part
    of a fit sentence, a restitution order is nevertheless appropriate and, if so,
    what amount should be ordered.</p>

    sanction imposed upon the offender, making the offender responsible for
    compensating loss to the victims, preventing the accused from profiting from
    crime, and providing a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery for
    the victim. A restitution order is appropriate where the amount that the
    victims have lost is capable of ready calculation. Conversely, a restitution
    order is not appropriate where the amount the victims have lost is uncertain
    and requires the court to interpret written documents or unravel involved
    commercial transactions. It is also inappropriate where there is a serious
    contest on legal or factual issues relating to restitution.</p>

    co-accused, James <span class=SpellE>Sylvestre</span>, a restitution order
    holding <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> responsible for the entire $37
    million lost by investors would be disproportionate to his involvement in the
    fraudulent scheme. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> did, however, retain
    control over $19.4 million. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> submitted that he should not be responsible for any
    of the administrative expenses he incurred in furtherance of his illegal
    scheme, such as salaries and commission paid to his employees. I would not give
    effect to this submission. It is not <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> net
    profit, or how good a manager he was of the money he obtained by
    misrepresentation, that is determinative of his responsibility. It is the
    amount of his responsibility for investors’ loss.</p>

class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> also submits that he has no money and no ability to
    pay restitution. The court has very little evidence concerning <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> ability to make restitution. The pre-sentence
    report indicated that he was doing periodic consulting work. <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> told the trial judge that as a result of the OSC
    proceedings he had been barred from working in the capital markets for 22
    years. He referred to financial hardship and difficulty in obtaining any kind
    of employment, and stated that he was an <span class=SpellE>undischarged</span> bankrupt. Even accepting <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> submission,
    ability to pay is but one factor to consider in making a restitution
    order.  It is not a precondition to
    making an order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    decisions on which <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> relies in support of his
    submission that no restitution order should be made on account of his inability
    to pay, such as <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Biegus</span> </i>(1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 245 (Ont. C.A.), do not involve a breach of trust.
    Indeed, in <i>R. v. Yates </i>(2002), 169
    C.C.C. (3d) 506 (B.C.C.A.), where an egregious breach of trust was involved,
    the court ordered restitution although there did not appear to be any
    likelihood of repayment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Recently
    in <i>R. v. Castro</i>, 2010 ONCA 718, this
    court had occasion to discuss two important factors that should be considered
    when deciding whether to impose a restitution order. They are the nature of the
    offence and, when money has been taken, what has happened to the money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Like <i>Castro</i>, the nature of the offence in
    the case at bar was a fraudulent taking of money that involved a breach of
    trust. The paramount consideration in cases involving breach of trust is the
    claims of the victims including the impact of the breach of trust on them: see <i>R. v. Fitzgibbon, </i>[1990] 1 S.C.R. 1005,
    at pp. 1014-15. In <i>Castro</i>, this court
    stated at para. 30:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In imposing a sentence where the offender has used
    his or her position to commit a breach of trust, the <i>primary</i> considerations are the protection of the public, general deterrence and the
    repudiation of the conduct of which the offender was found guilty.&nbsp;
    Relevant factors include the length of time over which the conduct took place,
    whether the offence was a sophisticated and well planned scheme, the amount
    involved, and, most importantly, the impact of the offender’s conduct on the
    victims.&nbsp; The<i> secondary </i>considerations are specific deterrence,
    rehabilitation and any mitigating circumstances such as a plea of guilty or
    co-operation with the authorities (in tracing the funds): <i>&nbsp;Scherer </i>[(1984), <span class=ssl20>16 C.C.C.
    (3d) 30 (Ont. C.A.)]</span>, per Martin J.A. at para. 34. [Emphasis in
    original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R. v. Wilder</i>, 2004 BCSC 644, <span
class=SpellE>aff’d</span> 2008 BCCA 370, the accused defrauded the Canadian
    government out of $38 million in taxes. The trial judge sentenced Wilder to
    make restitution in the amount of $5 million after noting that “the accused has
    been very careful to divest himself of all of his assets”, making tracing of
    the funds difficult. The amount of restitution ordered was not based on any
    specific tracing of profits but instead was calculated to broadly reflect
    Wilder’s degree of criminal responsibility for the damages suffered by the
    victim of his fraud. In upholding the restitution order, the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had correctly considered the
    egregious nature and magnitude of the frauds, Wilder’s means and ability to
    pay, and the fact that Wilder had personally received some of the missing $38
    million.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=ssl2><span lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>A similar approach should be taken here,
    since, like <i>Wilder</i>, the accused was
    the mastermind of a fraud, the amount of loss to the victims is ascertainable
    and the accused received some of the defrauded money, but actual tracing of
    individual investors’ funds is not possible due to the manner in which <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> dealt with those funds. In such situations, a
    restitution order may be made in an amount that generally reflects the
    culpability of the accused without slavishly relying on tracing or a strict
    calculation of the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> enrichment (as long as
    the amount ordered does not exceed the amount lost by the victims). This is in
    keeping with the principle that a restitution order is part of a sentence, and
    should not serve to displace the civil remedies necessary to ensure full
    compensation to victims: <i>R. v. <span
class=SpellE>Zelensky</span></i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 940; <span class=SpellE><i>Devgan</i></span> at <span class=ssl2>para.

lang=EN-US>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> committed a sophisticated well-planned breach of
    trust over an extended period of time that defrauded investors out of $37 million.
    As his counsel concedes, “There is no doubt that Saxton investors suffered
    greatly.” Thus, the primary consideration in this case is the protection of the
    public, general deterrence and repudiation of <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> conduct from which he personally benefitted. For example, <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> does not dispute spending at least $700,000 from Saxton accounts on expenses
    related to a residence in Burlington where he and his wife lived,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    in <i>Wilder</i>,<i> </i><span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> alleges that he cannot afford to
    pay as he has disposed of all the money. At the same time, the ultimate
    disposition of funds, including $5.8 million that <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> admits transferring from one of his Canadian companies, Saxton Investments, to
    another of his companies, Saxton SA in the Bahamas, is not known. The funds
    have been so co-mingled that tracing is impossible. <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> claim <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
    that <i>he is </i>u<i>n</i>able to earn sufficient income to make any restitution and his
    bald assertion that he has no assets begs the question of what happened to the
    money. A restitution order, which survives bankruptcy, is the only realistic
    way in which the victims will recover anything. I would hold that a restitution
    order is appropriate and, as part of a fit sentence, I would order restitution
    in the amount of $20 million.  I believe
    this amount best reflects <span class=SpellE>Eizenga’s</span> culpability in
    the fraud based on the factors discussed above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal as to sentence, set
    aside the restitution order in the amount of $35 million and, in its place,
    substitute an order for restitution in the amount of $20 million.</p>

    of conspiring to import cannabis resin. At the plea hearing, in support of the
    guilty plea, the Crown filed a memorandum summarizing its proposed evidence at
    trial. The memorandum contained a number of allegations that Newman had
    expressly told his defence counsel that he would not admit. Crown counsel advised
    the court that the memorandum was “subject to some probable finessing” by the
    two parties between the date of the plea and the date of the sentencing
    hearing. Defence counsel responded by stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Yes, sir. I might add for the record, sir, that we
    would be—in the interim period, of course, we will come up with a concise,
    precise statement of facts on this particular count that we’ll both put before
    you. There are certain things that are in issue. But I think by filing that
    [the memorandum] as an exhibit, that will be sufficient for a conviction to be
    registered today, sir, or the finding today. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Defence counsel reviewed the Crown’s proposed
    statement of facts with Newman and Newman expressly instructed him that he
    would not acknowledge certain allegations. The next day, defence counsel had a
    meeting with Crown counsel, who took a “take it or leave it approach” and said
    that he was not prepared to vary the statement of facts. Defence counsel swore
    that he believed he had advised Newman of this, but Newman provided no further
    instructions. Defence counsel also swore that it was his best judgment that
    Newman should still plead guilty, because he was concerned that Newman would
    not make a good witness if there were to be a trial. He also felt that if
    Newman pled guilty, he would likely receive a low penitentiary sentence because
    the pre-sentence report was positive.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Defence counsel signed the agreed statement of facts
    on behalf of Newman. The agreed statement of facts did not contradict the
    Crown’s memorandum but indicated that Newman was a more active participant in
    the conspiracy than the memorandum suggested. At the sentencing hearing,
    defence counsel began to take issue with some of the matters in the agreed
    statement of facts. The Crown interjected and said that “the record must be
    clear that the facts as alleged throughout the agreed statement of facts are
    facts that are agreed the Crown could prove beyond a reasonable doubt and are
    the facts that are before this court in terms of the standard” in <i>R. v. Gardiner</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368. Defence
    counsel indicated he was content.</p>

    that the <i>Securities Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. S.5, does not explicitly state that evidence gathered by the OSC is
    inadmissible at a criminal proceeding. However, s. 17(3) of the OSA provides:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Without the written consent
    of the person from whom the testimony was obtained, no order shall be made
    under subsection (1) authorizing the disclosure of testimony given under
    subsection 13(1) [the OSC’s investigative powers under] to,</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(a)    a municipal, provincial, federal or other
    police force or to a member of a police force; or</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(b)    a person responsible for the enforcement of
    the criminal law of Canada or of any other country or jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>The cases cited by the appellant discuss the broad

    inadmissible at a criminal proceeding.</p>

    alleged breaches with which <span class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> takes issue are: (1)
    that he gave inadequate disclosure of information about his companies to his
    investors; and (2) that the Saxton Group incurred considerable promotional and
    sales expenses, and paid out 5% commissions to sales representatives. <span
class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> claims that all new investors had to sign a waiver
    stating that they had read the Offering Memorandum. He also claims that the
    Saxton companies exploiting the seed capital exemption did not pay out
    commissions, because any commissions actually came from the Saxton Group’s
    management company, Saxton Investments Ltd.</p>

    that the Fifteenth Report of the interim manager of Sussex Group Ltd. (dated

class=SpellE>Eizenga</span> continuously stated at the sentencing hearing that
    Saxton’s Cuban operations (i.e. Sussex Group Ltd.) were legitimate and were
    running at a profit. In support of this claim, he filed as exhibits the Interim
    Manager reports prepared by HOCI from 2002 to 2006. However, HOCI’s reports all
    unambiguously characterize the financial and business <span class=verdana>affairs
    of Sussex Group Ltd. as being in confusion and disarray when HOCI took over as
    Interim Manager. In the first Interim Manager’s Report, dated April 26, 2002,
    HOCI wrote: “There appears to have been very limited transparency,
    responsibility or accountability in respect of the financial operations and
    management of the Sussex business. ... The businesses are grinding to a halt.
    Concerns about the misdirection of Sussex funds and assets and inappropriate
    use of authority have prevailed.”</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span class=verdana>In examining the company’s accounting
    records for the purpose of the Stage One Review Report, HOCI found a number of
    large and inadequately documented transactions, such as a “physical transfer”
    of $1.2 million in cash from Cuba to Canada and large cash transfers between
    Sussex personnel. HOCI wrote: “Given the various transfers of money and the
    large number of cash transactions, it is very difficult to trace the ultimate
    disposition of the funds.” Furthermore, a document titled, “Sussex Group
    Limited: Draft Summary of Statements of Operations and Deficit” showed that the
