  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lanark Mutual Insurance Company appeals a judgment that
    requires it to defend and indemnify the respondents in a tort action brought by
    their daughter, Naomi <span class=SpellE>Marchand</span>, who fell off the
    balcony of their home and was seriously injured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue is whether Naomi’s claim is excluded from the
    respondents’ farm insurance policy because she was an “insured”, defined to
    include a relative while “living in the named insured’s household”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that seven or eight years
    before her injury, Naomi had been driven from the family home at age 15 as a
    result of conflict with her mother, serious religious and lifestyle differences
    with both parents and her disclosure of five years of sexual exploitation by
    her father.  She had lived a peripatetic
    existence away from her parents for the next several years.  She had come to the respondents’ home to see
    her brother who was returning to Canada from Guyana and had been staying there
    for two and a half weeks before her injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the term “household”
    signified more than a transient visitor.  He found that at the time of her injury, Naomi shared no unity of
    purpose with her family and that she was merely a short-term visitor and not
    living in her parents’ “household”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error on the part of the application
    judge.  In the context of this case and
    this policy, the application judge’s reference to the definition of “you” and
    “your” in the part of the policy dealing with first party liability had no
    practical bearing on the proper interpretation of the phrase “living in the
    named insured’s household”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the application judge that the term
    “household” connotes a family like group of people living together with an
    element of intimacy or community in the relationship.  The exclusion clause protects the insurer
    against collusive claims brought by individuals living together in such
    relationships.  The respondents did not
    enjoy that type of relationship with Naomi.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is ample evidence to support the application
    judge’s conclusion that Naomi was not “living in the named insured’s household”
    at the time of her injury.  Her
    relationship with her parents had and remained completely broken down and she
    had not lived at her parents’ home since she had moved out or was evicted after
    her father’s sexual abuse conviction many years before her injury.  She had established an itinerant life of her
    own and it was open for the application judge to find that she was “not living
    in the named insured’s household” at the time of her injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  Costs fixed at $20,000 inclusive of
    disbursements and applicable taxes, as agreed to by the parties.</p>
