  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A contractor using a backhoe displaced a natural gas pipeline. Natural
    gas crept into the basement of a two-storey commercial plaza. A source of
    ignition entered the mix. An explosion and fire followed. Buildings were
    damaged and destroyed. People were injured. And seven people were killed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the year following the explosion, prosecutions under provincial
    safety legislation began against three companies. The contractor whose employee
    displaced the pipeline. The utility that owned the pipeline. And a company with
    which the utility had contracted to provide accurate information to the
    contractor about the location of pipelines in the area that was to be
    excavated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charges against the companies, contained in separate informations,
    were tried together. The contractor entered a plea of guilty during the prosecution’s
    case-in-chief, was ordered to pay a substantial fine and victim fine surcharge,
    and disappeared from the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the prosecution’s case had been completed, the utility and locator,
    without indicating whether they proposed to adduce evidence in their own
    defence, sought dismissal of the charges on several grounds. The trial judge,

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The nature of the proposed grounds of appeal
    does not command any recapture of the circumstances of the tragic aftermath of
    the explosion and fire that occurred at a west-end commercial plaza on April
    24, 2003. But, to place the proposed grounds of appeal in a setting that befits
    them, requires a brief sketch of the circumstances that led to the explosion
    and a bit of procedural history about the prosecution.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Project</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In April 2003, the City of Toronto undertook a
    major reconstruction of a stretch of Bloor Street West between Kipling Avenue
    and the East Mall. The project involved replacement of the road surface, curbs
    and associated storm drains, and sidewalk reconstruction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The construction zone included the area in front
    of a two-storey commercial plaza at 3885-3891 Bloor Street West. To remove the
    existing curb and gutter, as well as the adjacent sidewalk, the excavator used
    a backhoe. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principals</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Three companies had a hand in the explosion of
    April 24, 2003. Each had a different role:</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the utility:               Enbridge Gas
    Distribution Inc. (Enbridge)</span></h4>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Enbridge owns a natural gas distribution system.
    As a “licence holder” under the <i>Technical Standards and Safety Act</i>,
    2000, S.O. 2000, c. 16, (the <i>TSSA Act</i>) Enbridge is licenced to
    distribute natural gas by the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA).
    The TSSA is a not-for-profit safety organization and an agency of the
    Government of Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ontario Regulation 210/01, passed pursuant to
    the <i>TSSA Act</i>, governs oil and gas pipeline systems. Anyone engaged in an
    activity, use of equipment, process or procedure to which the Act and
    Regulation 210/01 apply must comply with the Act and Regulation. Section 9(1)
    of the Regulation prohibits digging, excavating or breaking ground with
    mechanical equipment without first ascertaining from the licence holder the
    location of any pipeline that may be interfered with. Under s. 9(2) of the
    Regulation, Enbridge, as the licence holder, must provide “as accurate
    information as possible on the location of any pipeline” within a reasonable
    time in all the circumstances to anyone involved in excavation activities that
    may interfere with the pipeline.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To discharge their obligation under s. 9(2) of
    the Regulation, Enbridge contracted with PUL, a company that provides
    information to excavators about pipeline locations. The Regulation does not
    provide a specific form for the information about pipeline locations. The
    practice in the industry, however, is one of “paint and paper”: paint markings
    on the surface of the ground plainly visible to excavators and a sketch of the services
    on paper.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A scheme similar to that imposed by Regulation
    210/01 under the <i>TSSA Act</i> is enacted by Regulation 213/91 passed
    pursuant to the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O. 1
    (<i>OHSA</i>). Under s. 228(1)(a) of this Regulation, gas services in and near
    an area to be excavated must be accurately located and marked before any
    excavation begins. The employer responsible for the excavation must request the
    owner of the service to locate and mark the service. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Warren is a road paving and construction
    company. The City of Toronto contracted with Warren to carry out the road and
    related reconstruction of Bloor Street West. Thus, Warren was “the
    employer…responsible for the excavation” under the applicable <i>OHSA</i> Regulation
    and the “person” involved in the excavation under the governing <i>TSSA</i> <i>Act</i> Regulation.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Preliminaries</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Warren asked Enbridge to identify and mark its
    underground natural gas pipelines in the area involved in the reconstruction
    before Warren began excavation. Enbridge contracted with PUL to provide the
    necessary information for Warren. PUL assigned one of its employees to locate
    and mark Enbridge’s pipelines in the area affected by the reconstruction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The PUL employee assigned the task of locating
    and marking Enbridge’s pipelines in the area affected by the reconstruction
    neither identified nor marked a three-quarter inch pipeline into the commercial
    plaza at 3885-3891 Bloor Street West.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Accident</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Warren’s backhoe operator inadvertently struck
    Enbridge’s unmarked pipeline into the plaza. The displacement dislodged the
    pipe from its fitting attached to the outside wall of the plaza. An unregulated
    flow of natural gas escaped into the basement of the plaza.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>About six to nine minutes after the pipe had
    become dislodged, an unknown source of ignition caused the gas to explode. The
    blast levelled the plaza. The force of the explosion and the ensuing fire
    damaged or destroyed several structures nearby. Seven people were killed,
    several more injured.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Prosecutions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the year following the explosion, both the
    Ministry of Labour and the TSSA commenced proceedings against Enbridge and PUL.
    The TSSA also charged Warren.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The charges against Enbridge and PUL alleged
    breaches of the <i>OHSA</i> and the <i>TSSA</i> <i>Act</i> and their respective
    Regulations arising from the failure to locate and mark for Warren the natural
    gas pipeline into the plaza disrupted by Warren’s backhoe operator. The charges
    against Warren alleged breaches of the <i>TSSA</i> <i>Act</i> and the
    Regulation governing gas pipeline systems arising out of Warren’s excavation
    without proper information about relevant pipeline locations and damage to the
    pipeline itself.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Trial Proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the end of the prosecution’s case-in-chief,
    counsel for Enbridge and PUL, without electing whether to call evidence in
    response to the charges, sought an order dismissing all the charges on the
    ground that the prosecutors had not proven the essential elements of each
    offence beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Enbridge and PUL argued that the prosecution
    under the <i>OHSA</i> was barred because the information was not laid within
    the time permitted or required by s. 69 of the Act. Even if the limitations
    period had not expired, the companies argued, the <i>OHSA</i> imposed no
    statutory duty on either Enbridge or PUL to provide an accurate “locate”.
    Neither fell within the scope of the term “employer” within the <i>OHSA</i>,
    thus were not subject to prosecution under the Regulation. The companies
    advanced a similar argument about the applicability of the <i>TSSA</i> <i>Act </i>and
    Regulation, except that no limitations period was applicable to that
    prosecution.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application succeeded before the trial judge
    who dismissed all charges against Enbridge and PUL.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal to the Superior
    Court of Justice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Ministry and TSSA appealed to the Superior
    Court of Justice. Bellamy J. allowed the appeal, quashed the order dismissing
    the charges against Enbridge and PUL and ordered a new trial on all charges to
    be held before a judge other than the judge who had presided at the original
    trial. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bellamy J. agreed with the trial judge that s.
    69 of the <i>OHSA</i> did not bar the prosecution under that Act. The appeal
    judge differed from the trial judge on all remaining issues. Bellamy J.
    concluded that both Enbridge and PUL came within the definition of “employer”
    in s. 25 of the <i>OHSA</i>. Each had a duty to provide accurate information to
    Warren about the location and nature of Enbridge’s pipeline and failed to
    discharge that duty. The failure to provide <i>any</i> information was a
    failure to provide “as accurate information as possible” under s. 9(2) of the
    Regulation under the <i>TSSA</i> <i>Act</i>. Enbridge failed to ensure that PUL
    provided the necessary information to Warren.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Enbridge and PUL seek leave to appeal to a panel
    of this Court under s. 131 of the <i>POA</i>. In their proposed notice of
    appeal, Enbridge and PUL raised five grounds of appeal. Four duplicate the
    grounds raised on the directed verdict application before the trial judge and
    reiterated before Bellamy J. on the appeal from the dismissal of the charges.
    What is new and different is a claim that Bellamy J. erred in law in permitting
    the prosecutors to resile on appeal from positions they had taken at trial and
    to advance a new basis of liability upon which to obtain a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Enbridge and PUL also seek leave to appeal from
    what they contend are errors made by the Superior Court judge in her
    interpretation of the former s. 228(1) of Ont. Reg. 213/91 under the <i>OHSA</i> and of s. 9(2) of Ont. Reg. under the <i>TSSA</i> <i>Act</i>. The applicants
    say that the <i>OHSA</i> imposed no duty on them to provide accurate
    information about pipeline locations and, under the <i>TSSA</i> <i>Act</i>, the
    failure to provide any information is not the equivalent of provision of
    inaccurate information. They add that Bellamy J. was wrong to have considered a
    subsequent amendment to s. 228(1) of Ont. Reg. 213/91 and to have characterized

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Each of the proposed grounds of appeal requires
    separate consideration. </span></p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Ground #1: The Shifting
    Prosecution “Theory”</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first proposed ground of appeal seeks review
    of what is alleged to be a change in the prosecutor’s “theory” of the applicants’
    liability between trial and appeal. To some extent this complaint is rooted in
    the interpretation of the provisions of s. 228(1) of Ont. Reg. 213/91 adopted
    by the appeal judge. That said, I will consider whether this proposed ground
    warrants leave to appeal independently of any argument about statutory
    interpretation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not grant leave to appeal on this
    proposed ground. My reasons are several.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, it is by no means clear that the basis of
    liability advanced by the prosecutor on the appeal from the dismissal of the
    informations amounted to a new “theory” of liability or advancement of an
    argument that the prosecutor chose not to put forward at trial. In other words,
    the factual substratum essential to found this argument is, at best,
    controversial. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the principles involved in the proposed
    ground of appeal are well-settled, beyond dispute at least since the decision
    in <i>Wexler</i> over 70 years ago. Their application to the circumstances of
    this case involves a question of mixed law and fact, thus falls outside the
    reach of s. 131(1) of the <i>POA</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, even assuming that what is proposed as a
    ground of appeal raises a question of law in the strict sense, it is not one
    that is likely to have an impact on firmly established jurisprudence in a way
    that is of general interest to a broad segment of the public. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And finally, it is unclear whether the
    applicants’ response before the appeal judge raised this issue upon which they
    now seek leave to appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Ground #2: The
    Interpretation of Regulation 213/91 under the OHSA</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This proposed ground of appeal raises an issue of statutory
    interpretation of the former and current provisions of s. 228(1) of Ont. Reg.
    213/91 passed pursuant to the <i>OHSA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial and appeal judge disagreed on whether the former s. 228(1)
    applied to the excavator, Warren, only, or extended to Enbridge and PUL. The
    applicability of s. 228(1) to Enbridge and PUL, according to the applicants,
    depends upon whether each is an “employer” under the <i>OHSA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 228(2) of the former Regulation by which liability is governed
    in this case required Warren to request Enbridge, as owner of the service, to
    locate and mark the service before excavation began. Enbridge contracted with
    PUL to locate and mark the service. The requirement of s. 228(2) that Warren
    request the owner, Enbridge, to locate and mark the service necessarily implies
    a duty on Enbridge, as owner, to do so. Were it otherwise, the service would
    not be located and marked since only the owner has the authority to do so.
    Enbridge plainly recognized this duty: it retained PUL to carry it out. By
    contracting with PUL to supply services, Enbridge became an “employer” under
    the Act. Likewise, PUL is a contractor who undertook with the owner, Enbridge,
    to perform work or supply services. Thus, PUL is an “employer” under the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This proposed ground does not warrant granting leave to appeal. My
    reasons are threefold.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the provisions of s. 228(1) of the Regulation under which this
    case was prosecuted are no longer in force. No other prosecutions under this
    version of the Regulation remain outstanding. It follows that the issues raised
    about its interpretation here do not extend beyond the borders of this case. To
    grant leave to appeal in the circumstances is not essential in the public
    interest or for the due administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the interpretation of the new s. 228(1) is not ripe for decision
    in this case. The new provision does not apply to this prosecution. Its
    interpretation can await a prosecution in which liability falls to be decided
    in accordance with its terms. Nor is there any pressing need to offer
    gratuitous advice about the relationship between the current and former provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the interpretation imposed upon the former provisions by the
    appeal judge is neither obviously wrong nor of doubtful correctness. Indeed,
    the practical effect of the contrary interpretation favoured by the trial judge
    yields a result that is antithetical to the legislative purpose of the <i>OHSA</i> – protection of workers from preventable harm.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Ground #3: The Limitations
    Bar of s. 69 of the OHSA</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applicants also seek leave to appeal on the
    applicability of s. 69 of the <i>OHSA</i>, a limitations provision, to the
    prosecution under the <i>OHSA</i>. Upon this issue, the trial and appeal judges
    were in agreement: s. 69 did not bar the prosecution.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This proposed ground of appeal does not warrant
    leave to appeal. Three factors inform my decision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To begin, whether a limitations provision
    applies to bar a particular prosecution, as in this case, has no resonance for
    the general administration of justice. Of surpassing importance to the
    individual litigants, an appellate pronouncement on this issue is <i>not </i>essential
    either in the public interest or for the due administration of justice. Readily
    accessible precedent is abundant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Next, I consider it highly doubtful whether the
    applicability of s. 69 of the Act to these circumstances involves a question of
    law alone as s. 131(1) of the <i>POA</i> requires. What would be involved, at
    least as it seems to me, would be, at best, a question of mixed fact and law: <i>Krukowski</i> at p. 159.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the interpretation rendered by both
    judges below is consistent with the purpose underlying the governing
    legislation, the protection of workers in their workplace, as well as
    controlling precedent. </span></p>

    the location of any pipeline. The information must be provided within a
    reasonable time in all the circumstances. Neither the Regulation nor the
    statute insists upon completion of a specific form to provide the required
    information. Industry practice involves both “paint”, visible location and
    directional marks on the surface to be excavated, and “paper”, a drawing or

    safety, the statute is not one with which the general public has daily

    with technical standards to ensure workplace safety in a narrow context.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the proposed ground of appeal does not
