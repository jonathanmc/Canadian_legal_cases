  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This endorsement addresses two matters: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        The costs of a re-argued motion before
    MacDougall J. of the Superior Court of Justice; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       The costs of the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The costs of the re-argued
    motion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    released our reasons for judgment in this matter on October 26, 2010.  In para. 44 of those reasons, we said that
    the boards of the corporations were </span>entitled to reimbursement for the
    costs of the corporations for the re-argument of the March 14, 2008 motion, which
    was re-argued on February 2, 2009.  The March
    14, 2008 motion resulted in the extension of the receivership for one year, the
    approval of certain of the receiver’s accounts and a disclosure order in favour
    of the boards.  The motion judge also
    ordered the receiver to pay, from the funds of the corporations, costs of
    $32,230.64 for counsel retained by the boards of the corporations.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the re-argued motion on February 2, 2009 the
    motion judge effectively reversed his position on costs and concluded that the
    boards did not have the right to retain counsel after the receivership order
    was made, based on his interpretation of the operating agreements between the
    City of Peterborough and the corporations.  The motion judge rescinded his previous costs order of $32,130.64.  Although he had concluded that the boards did
    not have the right to retain counsel he made a costs order in favour of the
    boards in the amount of $15,000.  He declined
    to award the boards costs for non-litigation legal work of $9,412.60.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Much of the argument in the re-argued motion was
    directed to the issue of whether the boards had the right to retain
    counsel.  The boards now seek costs of
    the re-argued motion, which they claim on a partial indemnity scale in the amount
    to $34,304 and on a full indemnity scale in the amount to $46,716, now reduced
    to $44,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant corporations are public sector
    organizations, which operate affordable rental housing for approximately 300
    persons from the Aboriginal community in the Peterborough area.  We would not expect public sector
    organizations to pay full indemnity hourly rates.  In any event, whether one applies the hourly
    rates on either a full indemnity scale or a partial indemnity scale to the
    number of docketed hours for the re-argued motion, it produces an unreasonable
    result.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the original motion argued on March 14, 2008,
    this court awarded $7,500 in costs to the boards, a sum suggested by counsel
    for the boards.  Counsel for the boards
    submits that the re-argued motion was based on a broader record, which
    justifies a greater costs award.  The
    total hours docketed by counsel for the boards is 156.1.  Although we accept that this was the time
    spent by counsel, it appears to us excessive.  Also, a number of orders made on the original motion were not the
    subject of the re-argued motion.  The
    principal issue on the re-argued motion was the right of the boards to retain
    counsel.  This is an important issue and
    arguably attracts a costs award greater than $7,500.  That said, we do not agree that it warrants 156.1
    hours of lawyer time.  </p>

lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We fix the costs of the re-argued motion in the
    amount of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.  </p>

    the notice of appeal was delivered in this case, the appellants moved before
    Blair J.A. in chambers for, <i>inter alia</i>,

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> We have decided to fix the costs as it will no
    doubt save valuable time required to educate an assessment officer on the
    factual and legal issues in the appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants’ bill of costs shows docketed time for Mr. Zbogar (a 2002 call) of
    170.7 hours and 30 hours for Mr. Bennett (a 1970 call).  The partial indemnity hourly rate for Mr.
    Zbogar is $150 and $500 for Mr. Bennett.  The substantial indemnity hourly rates are $200 and $750.  While these rates appear to reflect rates charged
    by counsel for private sector clients, we are of the view that the rates of Mr.
    Bennett are high for a public sector client.  The boards of the appellants filed bills of costs claiming $63,370 on a
    full indemnity scale and $46,533 on a partial indemnity scale.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    in the case of the re-argued motion, we are of the view that the “<span
class=GramE>hours</span> times rates” approach produces an unreasonable result
    whether on a full indemnity or partial indemnity scale.  This essentially single issue appeal simply
    does not attract costs in the range sought by counsel for the appellants.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    our view, a reasonable award of costs in respect of work done of this kind for
    public sector clients is $30,000.  We
    therefore fix the costs of the appeal payable to the boards of the appellants
    in the amount of $30,000 including disbursements and applicable taxes.</span></p>
