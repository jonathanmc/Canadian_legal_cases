  <p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a 39-day trial, the trial judge awarded
    damages for negligent misrepresentation to seven of the eight plaintiffs who
    had sued the federal government, excluding David Luck. The Attorney General of
    Canada (the “AGC”) and Mr. Luck both appeal from that decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The events giving rise to this litigation occurred more
    than a decade ago.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to October 15, 2000, one option for transferring
    pension monies between the Public Service Superannuation Plan (the “PSSP”) and private
    pension plans was by means of a reciprocal transfer agreement (“RTA”). Treasury
    Board Secretariat (“TBS”), the administrative arm of the Treasury Board, was
    responsible for negotiating such pension portability agreements with “approved”
    employers with valid private pension plans. One advantage of transferring
    monies pursuant to a RTA was that, in some cases, the transfer value was higher
    than it might otherwise have been (two times contributions plus interest).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the 300 or so RTAs at the time was the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA. It was the brainchild of Sylvain Parent, an
    actuary and pension consultant. Mr. Parent was the principal actuary of <span
class=SpellE>Welton</span> Parent Inc. (formerly known as <span class=SpellE>Welton</span> Beauchamp Parent Inc. (“WBP”)), an actuarial firm with a pension consulting
    focus. Leading up to the October 15, 2000 deadline for transferring monies
    pursuant to a RTA, Mr. Parent and WBP actively recruited federal public
    servants to join <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Limited (“<span class=SpellE>Loba</span>”)
    on the basis that it would be financially advantageous from a pension
    perspective. They attracted significant interest in <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> and some 120 public servants, including the plaintiffs, joined the consulting
    company. Mr. Parent was the President of <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> and owned
    both it and WBP through a personal holding company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The idea was that federal employees would resign from
    their employment with the public service, join <span class=SpellE>Loba</span>,
    and transfer their pension monies to the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> pension
    plan (the “<span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan”). The employees would remain
    with <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> only as long as it took to have their
    pension monies transferred. Once that happened, they would quit <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> and transfer their monies out of the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan, which was structured to permit cash payouts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While TBS had negotiated the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA, it had concerns about the legitimacy of the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> pension scheme.  For instance, it was
    concerned about the payout of pension monies in cash and, further, that the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan might not meet all requirements for registration
    under the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. 1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of concerns about the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> arrangements, TBS put a hold on transfers to the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan during the summer of 2000. The plaintiffs were not made aware of the hold.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the hold was eventually lifted, TBS officials
    continued to have concerns about the validity of the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan, which they communicated to the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”). The CRA
    shared its concerns about the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan and other
    similar plans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, the CRA set out its concerns in writing
    in a letter to TBS dated September 7, 2000 (the “TBS Letter”) and in a second
    similar letter to <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> and WBP dated September 15,
    2000 (the “Parent Letter”). The CRA intended that the TBS and Parent Letters be
    distributed to all those interested in RTAs so that they would be aware of the
    risks and could make an informed choice about their pension funds. The CRA
    asked TBS officials and Mr. Parent to distribute the letters setting out its
    concerns. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For various reasons, the TBS and Parent Letters were
    not broadly distributed as intended and requested by the CRA. The eight
    plaintiffs in this case did not receive copies of either letter and were not
    informed of most of the information contained in the letters. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, various government communications
    advised employees that if they applied by the October 15th RTA deadline, their
    monies would be transferred to the private pension plans designated by them. There
    was no mention in any of these communications of any risks associated with the
    transfer of pension monies pursuant to a RTA and, in particular, the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, <span class=SpellE>some time</span> after
    they had quit the public service and commenced employment with <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span>, the plaintiffs learned that transfers to the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan had been suspended, that the RCMP was investigating <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> and Mr. Parent, and that the CRA was investigating
    the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2003, the CRA filed a Notice of Intent to Revoke the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan, and the Federal Court of Appeal upheld
    that decision: 2004 D.T.C. 6680 (F.C.A.). Mr. Parent’s subsequent attempt to
    have the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan re-registered was unsuccessful:
    2009 D.T.C. 5033 (F.C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of the revocation, the plaintiffs’ pension
    monies were not transferred to the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs (except for Mr. Luck who did not claim
    any pension losses) sued the AGC, claiming the difference between: (1) the
    benefits (salary, pension, severance pay, health coverage, life insurance
    coverage) they would have received between the date of resignation from the
    public service and the date they likely would have retired from the public
    service had they not joined <span class=SpellE>Loba</span>; and (2) the
    benefits (earnings, pension, etc.) they actually received over the same period.
    All earned less after leaving the public service than they would have earned had
    they remained in the public service until their retirement date.  They also lost certain benefits available to
    public servants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The AGC in turn brought third party actions against <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span>, Mr. Parent, and WBP (collectively, the “<span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties”) for negligent misrepresentation and breach
    of fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the AGC was liable for
    negligent misrepresentation. The core of the trial judge’s findings against the
    AGC was:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the AGC owed duties of care to the plaintiffs as
    employer and pension plan administrator;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the AGC made explicit, implied and omitted
    representations regarding the availability of the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA as a legitimate pension portability option, which representations were
    misleading:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there were  explicit representations relating to the existence, legality and
    accessibility of the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there was an implied representation that the government
    had satisfied itself that  “approved” employers
    with RTAs with the government, including <span class=SpellE>Loba</span>, were
    legitimate employers and that the government was unaware of any circumstances that
    raised serious doubts as to whether a transfer could be made under the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA; and</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>there</span> was an omitted
    representation in the failure to advise the plaintiffs that there was a
    significant identifiable risk that the CRA would deregister the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan.</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the key negligence was the failure to distribute the TBS
    Letter from the CRA detailing the CRA’s concerns about pension transfers from
    the government to entities like <span class=SpellE>Loba</span>, or a failure to
    distribute the information in the TBS Letter, to the plaintiffs;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the plaintiffs reasonably relied on the AGC’s
    representations; and</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>the</span> explicit, implied and
    omitted representations caused the plaintiffs’ loss of government and pension
    income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties were also liable to the plaintiffs for negligent misrepresentation, as
    well as for breach of fiduciary duty. Her central findings in relation to the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties were:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties owed duties
    of care to the plaintiffs;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties did not owe fiduciary
    duties to the plaintiffs prior to their joining the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan, but did so thereafter;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties made
    negligent misrepresentations to the plaintiffs;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the key negligent misrepresentation was the failure to
    provide the plaintiffs with the TBS and Parent Letters or the information
    contained in the letters;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the failure in 4) also amounted to a breach of
    fiduciary duties on the part of the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties;</p>
  <p style='
line-height:200%;'>6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>in</span> addition, the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties withheld information about the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan beginning in January 2001 in further breach of
    their fiduciary duties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that both the AGC and the <span

    not lead evidence about the capitalized value of his pension benefits.  The trial judge observed (correctly, as it
    turns out) that it was possible that the capitalized value of the actual
    pension he received would be greater than the capitalized value of the pension
    he would have received had he remained in the public service until his
    anticipated retirement date.  In these
    circumstances, the trial judge determined that, although Mr. Luck had suffered
    a proven loss of $108,525 relating to his loss of salary and severance pay
    (which the trial judge would have reduced by 10 per cent for contributory
    negligence), his failure to lead evidence about his pension situation
    disentitled him to damages because he “chose to leave out a piece of the

    the first point, the trial judge was very careful in the way she described the
    locus within the federal government for the potential duty of care in this case
    – it was the Treasury Board, as employer and plan administrator, the
    Superannuation Directorate, which was responsible for the actual administration
    of the PSSP, and compensation advisors within the employing departments, who
    were responsible for advising employees regarding superannuation matters. She

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Public
    servants such as <span class=SpellE>Charko</span>, <span class=SpellE>Gravelle</span> and Macpherson working at the Pensions Division [of TBS], <span class=SpellE>Soucoup</span> and Swan working at the Superannuation Directorate [of Public Works and

    members of the PSSP to take advantage of </span>[a]<span lang=EN-US> RTA would rely on their representations
    regarding the existence, legality and accessibility of that RTA.  I also find that reliance on those
    representations by public servants in the Plaintiffs’ position, in the

    Swan, the compensation advisors in the departments and agencies, and those to

    is true that other branches of the government, including the CRA, and other government-related
    entities, such as the RCMP, were involved in various ways in assessing,
    investigating and regulating the RTA program. However, the plaintiffs’ claim –
    about money they alleged they had unfairly lost – was against their employer
    and their pension plan administrator. As explained by the trial judge (at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 627):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>What
    is being suggested [by the plaintiffs] is that, where the Pensions Division,
    that is charged with overseeing the RTAs entered into by the Treasury Board for
    the benefit of PSSP members, has specific knowledge of a significant risk
    associated with a category of such RTAs, the Treasury Board owes a duty of care
    to public servants whom it knows to be considering an RTA to advise them of the
    existence of that risk.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    misses the point that the entire RTA program was created by the federal government
    and that the federal government had created an internal apparatus, anchored in
    TBS and fleshed out with pension divisions and compensation <span class=GramE>advisors,
    that</span> was deeply involved in administering the program. Any step taken by
    an employee towards transferring his or her pension monies pursuant to a RTA
    with a new employer had an immediate impact on the employee’s status as a
    federal public servant (gone), salary (gone), and pension (transferred).
    Accordingly, it was the plaintiffs’ longstanding and current status as
    employees in the federal public service – not their potential new employment
    with a different employer – that grounds the duty of care. </span></p>

    government was not only the employer of the plaintiffs. It was also the
    administrator of the PSSP of which all the plaintiffs were members as federal
    government employees.   As this court
    said in <span class=SpellE><i>Hembruff</i></span><i> v. Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement
    Board</i> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 561, at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 66 and
    67, leave to appeal refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 3, there is a special
    relationship between the administrator of a pension plan and the members of the
    plan and, as a result, the administrator has an obligation to be mindful of
    plan members’ interests when administering the plan. In these circumstances,
    framing a duty of care in terms of providing information to employees and plan
    members about a known “significant risk associated with a category of such
    RTAs” fits comfortably within the description of the duty of care in the
    pension case law. There is nothing novel about the duty of care found by the
    trial judge in this case.</span></p>

    our view, the evidence</span> marshalled<span lang=EN-US> by the trial judge to support her conclusion of misrepresentation was
    very strong indeed. Although there were many facets to this evidence, we would
    mention just one by way of illustration, namely, the disconnect between what

    for RTAs about the significant risks associated with  transfers to the  <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan  and the ignorance of the lower level
    compensation advisors – the people who actually met with and assisted the
    employees – about those risks. As explained by the trial judge (at <span
class=SpellE>para</span>. 668):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In cross-examination, <span class=SpellE>Charko</span> acknowledged that he expected that the information provided to the Plaintiffs
    by compensation advisors would be “complete”.  All of the compensation advisors who dealt with the Plaintiffs were
    operating on the incorrect premise that the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA
    was a routine arrangement and transfer payments would occur in the normal
    course under the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA.  Since they were unaware that the Treasury
    Board had previously put the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> transfers on hold
    and that the Treasury Board was in possession of information that could result
    in its again putting the transfers on hold or suspending them indefinitely, the
    compensation advisors were not in a position to advise the Plaintiffs of the
    existence of these risks.  In essence,
    they were not in a position to provide the Plaintiffs with the relevant
    information they needed in order to make an informed decision relating to their
    pension options.  Had the compensation
    advisors been aware of the existence of Treasury Board concerns and of the
    earlier hold on transfers, at the very least, they could have advised the
    Plaintiffs to make further inquiries of the Treasury Board before submitting
    their resignations from the public service.  That was not done.</p>

    received from the AGC’s compensation advisors. Again, the standard of review of
    this issue is palpable and overriding error. Again, the trial judge dealt
    comprehensively with the evidence, including, importantly, providing an
    individual assessment of the evidence relating to reliance for each employee.
    She expressed her conclusion in this fashion (at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    substance of the evidence of each Plaintiff was that he or she had relied on

    service, became employed with <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> and submitted an
    Appendix B before October 15, 2000.  I
    interpret the Plaintiffs’ evidence as being that they relied on the written
    and/or oral communications from government representatives in concluding that
    the government was not aware of circumstances that created a significant risk
    that the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> pension plan would be de-registered and
    transfers under the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA would never occur.  I also accept the evidence of all of them that,
    had they been made aware that a significant risk existed that a transfer of
    their pension entitlement into the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> pension plan
    might not occur, this would have impacted their decision to leave the public

    assessing the issue of “substantial connection”, courts consider whether the

    negligence.  In cases where there is not
    a substantial connection between the damages and the negligence, the damages
    are said to be too remote for recovery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found as a fact that had the AGC
    advised the plaintiffs prior to their resignations from the public service of
    the significant risks that were identified by the CRA as being associated with <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span>-type <span class=GramE>arrangements,</span> the plaintiffs
    would not have resigned from the public service to join <span class=SpellE>Loba</span>.  The trial judge went on to conclude that it
    was the act of leaving the public service to join <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> that resulted in the damages because the plaintiffs’  employment with <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> did not provide them with the same salary and other benefits as those to which
    they would have been entitled had they continued in the public service.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each of the plaintiffs testified to the facts as found
    by the trial judge.  We see no basis to
    interfere with these findings.  Thus, it
    can be said that “but for” the AGC’s negligent misrepresentations, the plaintiffs
    would not have incurred the damages awarded.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The AGC argues, however, that the damages awarded by
    the trial judge for the loss of salaries and benefits are not substantially
    connected to the AGC’s negligent misrepresentations and are, therefore, not
    compensable.  The AGC makes three
    arguments in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the AGC argues that the damages were not
    reasonably foreseeable to the AGC.  The AGC
    had no way of knowing whether the plaintiffs would earn more or less at their <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> jobs. That being the case, the AGC could not have
    reasonably foreseen the damages claimed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge addressed this issue squarely.  She pointed out that a senior TBS official, Ann <span class=SpellE>Gravelle</span>, realized that if public servants resigned
    to join <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> and transfers were indefinitely
    suspended under the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA, the public servants
    risked incurring precisely the type of losses that they claimed in this
    case.  <span class=SpellE>Gravelle</span>,
    who was one of the principal TBS <span class=GramE>actors  on</span> this file, foresaw exactly the
    situation that ensued and led to the plaintiffs’ damages.  In our view, the losses that give rise to the
    damage awards were reasonably foreseeable to the AGC.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the AGC argues that it did not induce the plaintiffs
    to leave their public service employment and that the lack of any inducement
    weighs against a finding of causation.  While evidence of an inducement may be strong evidence to support a
    finding of causation, it is not essential.  In a case of negligent misrepresentation, a plaintiff need prove only
    that he or she relied on the misrepresentation in taking the course of action
    that led to the damage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge found reliance and had
    ample evidence to support her finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the AGC argues that the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties’ misrepresentations met the “but for” test and that had it not been for
    those misrepresentations, the plaintiffs would not have left the public
    service.  The fact that Mr. Parent, the
    principal of <span class=SpellE>Loba</span><span class=GramE>,  also</span> made misrepresentations to the plaintiffs
    does not negate the AGC’s liability.  The
    trial judge found that the plaintiffs relied on the AGC’s misrepresentations
    and that those misrepresentations were a cause of the loss.  It is not the law that a particular
    defendant’s negligent misrepresentation must be the sole cause of the
    plaintiff’s loss.  There can be more than
    one substantial cause.  It is sufficient
    that the plaintiff relied on the defendant’s statements to his or her detriment: <i>NBD Bank, </i>at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.

    duties to the plaintiffs before the date on which the plaintiffs became members

    is an exacting one: “The apportionment of liability is primarily a matter

    the trial judge’s apportionment and her fiduciary finding have been met. In our
    view, the trial judge erred by concluding that the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs only after the plaintiffs

    failing to properly account in her apportionment analysis for the fiduciary

    Finally, the trial judge erred by apportioning liability in a way that is
    fundamentally inconsistent with her own description of the blameworthy conduct

    consulting services narrowly in the above-mentioned part of her reasons, this
    is inconsistent with her other findings that cast the services provided to the

    broader language. For example, the trial judge elsewhere held that Mr. Parent
    (and therefore also WBP and <span class=SpellE>Loba</span>) advised the

    entrusting the fiduciary with information or seeking advice in circumstances
    that confer a source of power: see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Lac Minerals</i> and <span class=SpellE><i>Hodgkinson</i></span>”. This case involves a

class=SpellE>Loba</span> pension arrangements. In our view, these factors
    justified the reduction of the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Parties’ degree
    of fault below 50 per cent. However, in light of the quantitative and
    qualitative parity in her description of the blameworthy acts of both parties

    linked to his expectation that he would receive a gain in the value of his
    pension and the belief that the gain would more than offset any loss.  Mr. Luck’s expectation of a pension gain was
    no doubt based in large part on an expectation that his pension funds would be
    transferred to the <span class=SpellE>Loba</span> Plan under the <span
class=SpellE>Loba</span> RTA.  That did

    a negligent misrepresentation that led to an early resignation and a loss of

    Mr. Gauthier received a gain in his pension benefits.  The New Brunswick Court of Appeal held that
    the defendant was entitled to a credit for the amount of the pension gain in

    evidence relating to the potential pension gain.  Thus, we would dismiss the appeal. In light
    of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with the AGC’s cross appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The AGC’s appeal is therefore
    allowed, in part, to accord with these reasons. Mr. Luck’s appeal is dismissed,
    as is the AGC’s cross-appeal in that proceeding. In light of our disposition of
    these appeals, the AGC shall deliver its brief written submissions concerning
    costs in respect of the main appeal and Mr. Luck’s appeal to the Registrar of
    this court within 14 days from the date hereof. The respondents in the main
    appeal and the appellant in Mr. Luck’s appeal shall deliver their brief written
    responding costs submissions within 14 days thereafter.</span></p>
