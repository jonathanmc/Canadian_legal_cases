  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Infanticide has been part of the criminal law of
    Canada for over 60 years.  Homicides for
    which a conviction for infanticide is a possible verdict are rare.  Most of the few convictions for infanticide
    are the product of guilty pleas.  There
    is no Canadian appellate decision that has examined the infanticide provisions
    in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, <span
class=GramE>c</span>. C-46 in any detail.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  This appeal raises an issue that goes to the
    very nature of those provisions.  Is
    infanticide both a substantive offence and a partial defence to a murder charge,
    or is it exclusively a substantive offence that may in appropriate cases be an
    included offence in a murder charge to be considered by the trier of fact if,
    and only if, the Crown fails to prove murder?  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Choosing between the two characterizations of
    infanticide has profound importance in a case like this one where a mother is
    charged with murdering her child.  If
    infanticide provides a partial defence to murder, the mother will escape a
    murder conviction if the homicide falls within the purview of infanticide even
    though the Crown may prove all the essential elements of the crime of
    murder.  If, however, infanticide
    operates only as a potential included offence on a murder charge, and if the Crown
    proves the essential elements of murder, the mother must be convicted of murder
    even though the homicide falls within the meaning of infanticide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The two interpretations lead to dramatically
    different sentencing options.  If the
    mother can raise infanticide as a partial defence, and if she is successful and
    convicted of infanticide, she is liable to a maximum penalty of five
    years.  Existing sentencing patterns
    suggest she could receive a non-custodial sentence:  see G. Fitch, “Infanticide” (Paper presented
    to the National Criminal Law Program: Substantive Criminal Law, Halifax, Nova
    Scotia, July 2004) Federation of Law Societies of Canada, 2004, section 11.5,
    at p. 17.  However, if infanticide serves
    only as a potential included offence if murder is not proved and the mother is found
    to have committed murder, she must be sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The submissions made by the Crown, respondent
    and intervener also raise two additional issues that affect the operation of
    the provisions: </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What is the <i>mens
    rea</i> or fault requirement for infanticide?</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If an accused can raise a “defence” of
    infanticide to a murder charge, does the Crown have the onus of negating that
    defence, or is the accused required to establish on a balance of probabilities
    that the homicide constitutes infanticide?</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>L.B. was charged with two counts of first degree
    murder.  The Crown alleged that she
    murdered two of her children, Alexander in 1998 and Cameron in 2002.  L.B. was seventeen years of age at the time
    of the first homicide and subject to the terms of the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (“<i>YCJA</i>”).  She was an adult at
    the time of the second homicide, making the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> the applicable legislation.  On
    consent, the two charges were tried before a judge without a jury.  The parties agreed that L.B. would be
    arraigned on the <i>Criminal Code</i> charge
    first and that the evidence and submissions heard at that trial would be
    applied on the trial of the charge prosecuted under the <i>YCJA</i>.  The trial judge acquitted
    L.B. on the murder charges and convicted her of the included offence of
    infanticide on both charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge sentenced L.B. to 18 months on
    the count prosecuted under the <i>YCJA</i>.  The first 12 months were to be served in jail
    and the last six months under supervision in the community.  The trial judge also imposed a six month
    probation term.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the second conviction, prosecuted under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the trial judge took into
    consideration L.B.’s pre-trial custody (two and a half years) and imposed a
    sentence of one day to be followed by three years probation.  That sentence was to run consecutively to the
    sentence imposed under the <i>YCJA</i>.  He also ordered L.B. to enter into a common
    law peace bond for a 20-year term.  The
    only provision in the peace bond required L.B. to notify the child welfare
    agency in the jurisdiction where she lived should she become pregnant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown appeals the acquittals on the murder
    charges, submitting that, as the trial judge found that the Crown had
    established all the essential elements of first degree murder on both charges,
    he erred in law in acquitting on those charges and convicting on the charges of
    infanticide.  The Crown seeks a new trial
    on the murder charges.<a href="#_ftn2"

    Alexander, on August 12, 1998.  Six weeks

    her children.  She had become depressed
    and was feeling overwhelmed.  L.B. had a history
    of psychiatric problems.  She had been admitted
    under the <i>Mental Health Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. M.7 to the Homewood Mental Health Centre (“Homewood”) about eight
    years earlier in May 1997.  In November
    2004, L.B. told a friend that she was losing her temper with her two remaining children.  Her friend convinced L.B. to visit a public
    health nurse.  L.B. was seen by a doctor
    shortly before Christmas 2004.  He prescribed
    antidepressant medication.  </p>

    told the attending physician that she had killed two of her children.  L.B. kept a journal while in Homewood.  In the journal she described killing her two
    children.  L.B. also told her husband,
    K.B., that she had smothered the children.  She was arrested and charged with two counts of murder in January 2005.  </p>

    babies.  L.B. insisted that she did not
    want to hurt her children, but wanted to help them.  L.B. was obviously overwhelmed with feelings
    of guilt when she made her statement to the police.  The trial judge, at para. 4 of his <span

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent had a troubled childhood.  Her mother, who was only 19 when she had the
    respondent, was later diagnosed as an alcoholic.  The respondent’s mother had been abused by her
    parents.  She neglected the respondent’s
    emotional needs and, on occasion, physically abused her.  The respondent’s parents separated when she
    was a young girl.  The respondent
    reported feeling unwanted as a child.  As
    an infant, she spent three months as a ward of the Children’s Aid Society.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>People who knew the respondent as a child
    described her as angry and depressed.  She hated being alone.  By the
    time the respondent was in grade 11, she had been ordered out of her father’s
    home and was living with a friend.  The
    respondent began to engage in a variety of self-destructive behaviour
    suggestive of suicidal ideation.  She
    eventually found herself admitted to Homewood in May 1997 and remained there
    for two weeks.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent and D.D., high school classmates,
    became romantically involved in 1997.  L.B.
    was sixteen years old and D.D. was seventeen.  The respondent wanted to have a baby.  She became pregnant and D.D. quit school and got a job.  The respondent and D.D. began to live
    together in the spring of 1998.  She was
    pregnant and very excited about having a baby.  D.D. was fully supportive and did his best to provide for his family’s
    financial needs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Alexander was born in August 1998.  D.D., the respondent and Alexander lived in a
    three-unit apartment building.  D.D.’s
    mother lived in one of the other apartments.  After Alexander’s birth, the respondent had the support of her father, D.D.’s
    mother and other neighbours in the building.  D.D. did his best to help out, but he was out of the home a great deal,
    often working 12-hour shifts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Alexander’s health and development seemed
    relatively normal in the weeks after his birth.  The respondent breastfed Alexander for about four weeks.  The respondent did not take well to
    motherhood.  She became frustrated and
    angry with the burden of caring for her new baby.  She often seemed depressed and obsessive
    about cleanliness.  Her friends and
    neighbours noticed that she would seem “zoned out” at times.  Her relationship with D.D. deteriorated and
    they often argued.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her statement to the police, the respondent
    described a variety of feelings on the day she killed Alexander.  His crying made her angry.  She wanted him to stop.  When he did not, she placed him in his crib,
    covered him with blankets and placed a plastic cover over him.  She then left his room and turned on some
    music.  The respondent told the police that
    she was very confused and insisted she wanted to help Alexander feel
    better.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kodie, the respondent’s second child, was born
    in May 2001.  The respondent was very
    attentive to Kodie’s needs and things appeared to be going relatively
    well.  The respondent had the support of
    her husband, in-laws and neighbours.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cameron was born in September 2002.  She breastfed Cameron for three weeks.  From the outset, the respondent did not seem
    to be as attentive to Cameron as she was to Kodie.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cameron was a somewhat difficult child who
    experienced some minor medical problems.  There were trips to the hospital.  There is some evidence that the respondent actually started to smother
    Cameron on one occasion before his death, but managed to stop herself.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cameron was hospitalized briefly in late
    November 2002.  The respondent and her
    husband took Cameron back to the hospital on December 1, 2002.  He was dehydrated.  The doctor prescribed some medication and
    Cameron was sent home with his parents.  The respondent killed Cameron later that night.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her statement to the police, the respondent
    reported that on the day she killed Cameron she was very upset and feared that
    she would do harm to Cameron.  The
    respondent wanted Cameron to die, believing it was the right thing to do.  She knew she needed help and tried to get her
    husband to stay home that day.  She did
    not, however, tell anyone about her feelings.  When she killed Cameron, she told him he was going to a better
    place.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge had the benefit of detailed
    psychiatric reports and testimony from Dr. P. Klassen and Dr. J. Gojer.  Dr. Klassen saw the respondent pursuant to a
    court ordered assessment.  Dr. Gojer was
    retained by the defence.  Both doctors
    had a great deal of material available to them; however, neither saw the
    respondent until well after the charges were laid and several years after the
    homicides.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge thoroughly reviewed the evidence
    of both psychiatrists.  I do not propose
    to repeat that review.  The trial judge
    noted that the opinions of Drs. Gojer and Klassen were very similar in most
    respects.  Ultimately, the trial judge preferred
    Dr. Gojer’s opinion as to the significance of the respondent’s post-partum
    depression.  The trial judge was entitled
    to make that determination and it is not challenged on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both psychiatrists agreed that the respondent
    suffered from a serious personality disorder prior to her pregnancies.  Dr. Klassen described her as suffering from
    borderline personality disorder and to a lesser extent, histrionic personality
    disorder.  He described these disorders
    as typically emerging during adolescence.  Dr. Gojer testified that the respondent suffered from a personality
    disorder with prominent borderline traits stemming from issues of rejection and
    abandonment.  Both psychiatrists agreed
    that the respondent’s personality features predisposed her to post-partum mood
    disturbance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Gojer opined that the respondent was
    suffering from a mixed effective disorder at the time of both homicides.  In his report, he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is likely that her mental state at the time of both
    homicides was impacted on or associated with mood and behavioural changes as a
    consequence of the effects of child birth, from which she had not fully
    recovered …</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Klassen agreed with Dr. Gojer’s evidence
    that biological and endocrinological changes caused by pregnancy could produce
    major clinical depression with post-partum onset.  He described three levels of that depression
    ranging from the “baby blues” through to full blown post-partum psychosis.  There was no suggestion that the respondent
    suffered from post-partum psychosis.  Dr.
    Klassen accepted that the respondent suffered from some level of post-partum
    depression.  He could not exclude the
    possibility that the respondent experienced a major depressive disorder with
    post-partum onset at the time of the homicides.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both psychiatrists acknowledged the difficulty
    in isolating and quantifying the biological, psychological and social factors that
    could contribute to a mother’s mental state after giving birth.  As I understand their evidence, Dr. Gojer put
    a heavier emphasis on the impact of post-partum related depression on the
    respondent’s state of mind when she killed her children than did Dr.
    Klassen.  However, Dr. Klassen
    acknowledged the presence of post-partum depression, but could not quantify the
    role played by that depression in the respondent’s mental state at the relevant
    time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ultimately concluded, at para.
    66:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We know that this disturbance of the mind, which
    sometimes affects new mothers, can have a variety of causes and it is almost
    certain ... that biological reasons related to hormonal changes are included
    therein.  It would appear that
    biological, social and psychological factors all intersect and, depending on
    the severity of each and also depending on the predisposition of the mother
    whose actions are being considered, different consequences may follow.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge went on to hold that he was
    satisfied that the respondent’s mind was disturbed as a result of her not
    having fully recovered from the biological effects of giving birth or perhaps
    the effects of lactation at the time she killed her children.  He determined that the disturbance caused by
    the effects of giving birth and perhaps lactation was sufficient to afford the
    respondent the defence of infanticide.</p>

  <h2>The Conduct of the Trial </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for L.B. relied almost exclusively on
    the partial defence of infanticide.  Counsel
    conceded that the Crown had established the essential elements of the crime of
    murder as defined in s. 229(a), and that L.B. did not have a s. 16 defence (not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder) to either charge.  On the issues of planning and deliberation,
    the defence acknowledged that there was evidence of both but argued that the
    planning and deliberation had not preceded the formation of the intent to kill
    and could not, therefore, support a finding of planning and deliberation for
    the purpose of a first degree murder conviction.  The trial judge rejected this submission and concluded,
    at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]here can be no doubt on the totality of the
    evidence (as all counsel agree) that both planning and deliberation have been
    amply proven by the evidence, and that at the requisite time in each case (that
    is to say when the blankets and plastic sheeting were pulled over the head of
    the infant in each case) Ms. B. had the intent to put them to sleep
    permanently, to murder them.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Accordingly,
    subject to the issue of the role, if any, which infanticide might play in my
    judgment, I make a tentative finding of guilt of first degree murder with
    respect to each of Alexander and Cameron.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After concluding that the Crown had established
    the essential elements of first degree murder, the trial judge went on to
    consider infanticide.  He accepted that
    infanticide provided a partial defence to murder in that a homicide that met
    the criteria for a murder could be reduced to infanticide if it met the
    criteria for infanticide.  The trial
    judge held, contrary to the defence position, that the accused was required to
    establish the partial defence of infanticide on the balance of probabilities.  After a review of the evidence, the trial
    judge determined that the defence had met the burden of proof and established
    the partial defence of infanticide.  The
    trial judge found the respondent not guilty on the charges of first degree
    murder and guilty on both counts of the included offence of infanticide.</p>

  <h2>The Issues</h2>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before turning to the issues as outlined above,
    I will address a preliminary argument made by Mr. Breen in his factum on behalf
    of the respondent.  He submitted that the
    Crown conceded at trial that infanticide was a partial defence to murder and
    should not be allowed to take a different position on a Crown appeal.  Mr. Breen asked that the appeal be dismissed
    as an abuse of process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown raised the interpretation of the
    infanticide provisions at the outset of the trial.  Crown counsel submitted that infanticide was
    not a partial defence to murder, but was only available as a potential included
    offence if murder was not made out.  Defence
    counsel took the contrary position.  The
    trial judge ruled that infanticide was available as a partial defence to
    murder.  The trial proceeded.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the trial, the trial judge expressed some
    unease with the ruling he had made.  He
    suggested that he needed “some help” from counsel and that more detailed
    argument would be welcomed.  It is
    unclear from the trial judge’s comments whether he was referring specifically to
    his ruling that infanticide was a partial defence to murder.  I think it is fair to say that the trial
    judge was prepared to hear further argument on and reconsider any of the issues
    he had decided, including whether infanticide was a partial defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither the Crown nor the defence made any
    further arguments.  In closing
    submissions, Crown counsel accepted, in keeping with the trial judge’s ruling
    at the beginning of the <span class=GramE>trial, that</span> infanticide could
    operate as a partial defence to murder.  At
    paras. 39-40 of his reasons for judgment, the trial judge reiterated his
    conclusion that infanticide was a partial defence to murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown chose to abide by the ruling of the
    trial judge made at the outset of the trial and to proceed in accordance with
    that ruling.  That decision does not
    preclude the Crown from arguing on appeal, as it did at the outset of the
    trial, that infanticide was not a partial defence to murder.    </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Woollcombe for the Crown, in able
    submissions, relies on a plain reading of ss. 233 and 662(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  She submits that those sections provide that
    infanticide is an indictable offence that may be charged as an offence in an
    indictment or left with the jury as an included offence on a charge of murder
    in appropriate circumstances.  She
    contends that there is nothing in the language of these provisions to support
    the claim that infanticide can also operate as a partial defence to reduce what
    would otherwise be murder to infanticide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Woollcombe begins her analysis with the
    language of s. 233.  She submits that the
    section creates the indictable offence of infanticide – nothing more and
    nothing less.  Section 233 reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A female person commits infanticide when by a wilful
    act or omission she causes the death of her newly-born child, if at the time of
    the act or omission she is not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth
    to the child and by reason thereof or of the effect of lactation consequent on
    the birth of the child her mind is then disturbed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Woollcombe contrasts the language of s. 233
    with the language of s. 232(1), which unquestionably recognizes provocation as
    a partial defence that reduces murder to manslaughter:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Culpable homicide that otherwise would be
    murder may be reduced to manslaughter</i> if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by
    sudden provocation.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel asserts that absent language like
    “culpable homicide that would otherwise be murder may be reduced to
    manslaughter”, s. 233 cannot be read as providing a partial defence to murder
    as provocation undoubtedly does.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel next refers to s. 662(3).  That section declares that infanticide is a
    statutorily included offence in a murder charge.  Crown counsel submits, however, that nothing
    in the language makes infanticide a partial defence capable of reducing murder to
    a lesser offence.  Section 662(3) provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]here a count charges murder and the evidence
    proves manslaughter or infanticide <i>but
    does not prove murder</i>,<i> </i>the jury
    may find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter or
    infanticide, but shall not on that count find the accused guilty of any other
    offence.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As Ms. Woollcombe correctly points out, a lesser
    and included offence is, by its very nature, only considered by the jury if the
    full offence charged is not proved.  She argues
    that this self-evident relationship between the full crime charged and the
    potential lesser and included offence is made explicit in s. 662(3) by the
    words “but does not prove murder”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel also places s. 662(3) beside ss.
    610(2) and 610(4).  Sections 610(2) and 610(4)
    are procedural provisions that, taken together, preclude successive
    prosecutions for the same homicide charged as murder, manslaughter or
    infanticide.  Crown counsel submits that ss.
    610(2) and 610(4), read with s. 662(3)<span class=GramE>,</span> ensure that an
    accused’s culpability in a homicide will be determined once and for all in a
    single prosecution.  She submits that
    nothing in these procedural provisions suggests that infanticide is a partial defence
    to murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Woollcombe also urges the court to refrain
    from “judicially creating” an infanticide defence.  She contends that the concept of infanticide,
    which reduces murder to a much less culpable homicide, rests on discredited
    medical opinions and assumptions about the plight of young unwed mothers that
    do not accord with present reality, and constitutes an unacceptable devaluation
    of the worth of a newborn child.  She
    also argues that recognizing infanticide as a partial defence to murder would be
    inconsistent with the rationale underlying other justifications and excuses
    recognized as common law defences in the criminal law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I assume that Ms. Woollcombe is referring to s.
    8(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> when she
    refers to “judicially created” defences.  I do not see this as a case where the court must decide whether to
    recognize a common law defence of infanticide.  This is a case of statutory interpretation.  If infanticide is a partial defence, it is
    because the <i>Criminal Code</i>, properly
    interpreted, provides for that partial defence.  If the <i>Criminal Code</i> makes
    infanticide a partial defence to murder, it is not for the court to decide
    whether that partial defence reflects sound criminal law policy or should be
    reconsidered in light of advancements in medical knowledge and/or changed
    social circumstances.  Those are matters
    for Parliament.  In the same vein, if the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides for the
    defence, it is irrelevant whether the defence is consistent with the rationale
    underlying common law criminal defences.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    Proper Approach to Statutory Interpretation</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel’s interpretation of s. 233 and s.
    662(3) is supported by the language of those sections.  Statutory interpretation, however, requires
    more than a close reading and careful parsing of the words of the text of the
    specific sections in issue:  <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes</i>, [1998] 1
    S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; <i>Montr</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>al

style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>bec Inc.</i>, [2005] 3
    S.C.R. 141, at para. 9.  Statutory
    interpretation is a multi-faceted exercise that looks to the language used in
    the relevant provisions, the statutory context in which those provisions appear
    and the object and purpose of the provisions in issue:  <i>Re
    Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code</i>, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248, at
    para. 34.  Professor Driedger’s “modern principle”
    has become the accepted approach to statutory interpretation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is only one principle or <span class=GramE>approach,</span> namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context, in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>    I take
    the “modern principle” of statutory interpretation to mean that the words of a

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Criminal
    Code</i> is the statutory context in which the infanticide provisions are found.  I will focus on the homicide related
    provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Read together, those provisions provide a
    detailed, integrated statutory scheme of which infanticide is one part.  The homicide provisions constitute the
    relevant statutory context.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 222(1) defines homicide as causing the
    death of a human being by any direct or indirect means.  Homicides are culpable or non-culpable: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 222(2).  The former are criminal, the latter are not: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 222(3).  A person commits culpable homicide when that
    person causes the death of another person by one of the means described in s.
    222(5).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 222(4) divides culpable homicides into
    three different indictable offences: murder, infanticide and manslaughter.  Murder is defined in s. 229 and subdivided
    into first and second degree murder by s. 231.  All murders are punishable by a minimum sentence of life imprisonment: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 235.  Infanticide is defined in s. 233 and is
    punishable by a maximum of five years in prison: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 237.  There
    is no minimum punishment.  All culpable
    homicides that are neither murder nor infanticide are manslaughter: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 234.  Manslaughter is punishable by a maximum of
    life imprisonment: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s.
    236(b).  There is no minimum punishment for
    manslaughter unless a firearm is used in the commission of the manslaughter: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 236(a).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Murder and manslaughter are distinguished by the
    mental element required to prove murder.  Murder requires proof of an intention to kill (s. 229(a)(i)) or an
    appreciation that one’s acts are likely to cause death (s. 229(a)(ii), s.
    229(c)).  Manslaughter does not require
    either an intention to kill or an appreciation that death may be caused by
    one’s acts, but instead requires objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily
    harm: <i>R. v. Creighton</i>, [1993] 3
    S.C.R. 3, at pp. 44-45.  The requisite
    mental element required to prove murder is what makes murder more morally
    culpable than manslaughter and justifies the more punitive sentence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike murder and manslaughter, infanticide and
    murder are not distinguished by the required mental element.  Infanticide requires a “wilful act or omission”
    that causes death.  The conduct must also
    be culpable homicide within s. 222(5), meaning, in most cases, that the conduct
    must constitute either an unlawful act or criminal negligence:  <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, ss. 222(5<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) and (b).  As will be explained later in these reasons, although
    the mental element of infanticide is not limited to the intention to kill, an
    act or omission done with the intent necessary for murder will satisfy the <i>mens rea</i> component of infanticide.  The distinction between murder and infanticide
    lies more in the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> than the <i>mens rea</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Infanticide, as defined in s. 233, targets a <span
class=GramE>very</span> particularized form of culpable homicide.  The section has potential application only where
    a mother kills her newborn child, defined in the <i>Criminal Code</i> as a child <span class=GramE>under</span> one year of
    age.  The potential application of
    infanticide is further limited by requiring that at the time of the homicide,
    the mother’s mind must be “disturbed”, either because she is not fully
    recovered from the effects of giving birth or by reason of the effect of
    lactation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The definition of infanticide focuses on two
    things.  First, it requires a
    mother-child relationship between the perpetrator and the victim.  Second, the mental state of the perpetrator/mother
    must be disturbed and that disturbance must be connected to the effects of
    giving birth or lactation.  Unlike other
    mental states that may mitigate criminal responsibility, infanticide does not
    require any causal connection between the disturbance of the mother’s mind and
    the decision to do the thing that caused her child’s death: <i>R. v. Guimont</i> (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d)
    314 (Q.C.A.), at p. 317; E. Cunliffe, “Infanticide:  Legislative History and Current Questions” (2009)
    55 Crim. L.Q. 94, at pp. 112-113;  I.
    Grant, D. Chunn &amp; C. Boyle, <i>The Law
    of Homicide</i>, loose-leaf (Scarborough: Carswell, 1995), at p. 4-91.  Because the mother’s mental “disturbance” is
    not connected to the decision to kill, that “disturbance” is better considered
    as part of the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> and not a <i>mens rea</i> component of the
    crime of infanticide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The drastically different penalties available
    upon conviction for murder, manslaughter or infanticide reflect the very
    different levels of moral blameworthiness attached to each offence.  Clearly murder is regarded as the most
    blameworthy and infanticide as the least blameworthy.  Manslaughter occupies that vast middle ground
    of blameworthiness between the two extremes of murder and infanticide.  The very different penalties prescribed by Parliament
    for the offences of murder and infanticide leave no doubt that a mother who commits
    a culpable homicide that constitutes infanticide is regarded as having
    committed a much less serious crime than someone who committed murder. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 222(4) declares that “culpable homicide
    is murder or manslaughter or infanticide.”  Section 222(4) suggests that the three categories of culpable homicide
    are alternatives to each other, such that any specific culpable homicide will
    fit within one and only one of the three categories.  To properly place a particular culpable
    homicide in its appropriate category one must look to the definitions of murder
    and infanticide.  If the homicide does
    not fit within either of those specific definitions, by operation of s. 234, the
    homicide is categorized as manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Infanticide is clearly a much more specific form
    of culpable homicide than murder.  In my
    view, it is arguable that, in categorizing a culpable homicide, one must begin
    with the narrower and more specific definition of infanticide.  If a homicide fits within that definition it
    is excluded by the operation of s. 222(4) from the broader category of culpable
    homicides defined as murder.  On this approach,
    a culpable homicide that is infanticide is not murder.  For the purpose of s. 662(3), the Crown fails
    to prove murder if the homicide is infanticide, thereby allowing a jury to return
    a verdict on the included offence of infanticide.  Counsel for the respondent and the
    intervener, in their helpful submissions, advance this interpretation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not go so far as to agree with counsel that
    the reading of the homicide provisions as a whole compels the interpretation
    they have advanced as summarized immediately above.  I am satisfied, however, that placing s. 233
    and s. 662(3) in the broader context of the homicide regime renders the
    interpretation urged by Crown counsel considerably less obvious than it appears
    to be when those two sections are considered in isolation.   The
    exercise in statutory interpretation must go beyond the words of those sections
    even as read in the context of the other homicide provisions.</p>

    however, the interpreter must be cautious not to confuse the legislative purpose

    Act, 1922</i> (Appendix “A”) was the culmination of a long struggle for
    legislation that drew a distinction between mothers who killed their newborn
    children, often in most difficult circumstances, from other forms of culpable
    homicide.  Juries had demonstrated a
    strong reluctance to convict mothers who had killed their newborn children of murder.  At the time, murder carried a mandatory death
    penalty.  Juries would acquit mothers
    entirely or convict of substantially less serious charges, such as concealing
    the child’s birth, even where the evidence left no doubt that the mother had
    killed her child:  see D. Seaborne
    Davies, “Child-Killing in English Law” in <i>The
    Modern Approach to Criminal Law: Collected Essays</i> (London, U.K.: MacMillan
    and Co., 1945) 301, at pp. 316-18; Law Commission, <i>A New Homicide Act for England and Wales?  A Consultation Paper</i> (Consultation Paper

    judges balked at engaging in what was described as a “black cap farce”,
    requiring judges to pronounce a death penalty knowing that the penalty was a monstrous
    overreaction to the crime and that it would never be carried out.  This “solemn mockery” was said to do nothing
    other than terrorize the mother on whom it was pronounced as she was probably the
    only person in the courtroom who did not know that the penalty would never be carried
    out: Davies, at p. 319; Law Commission, <span class=GramE><i>A</i></span><i> New Homicide Act for

    Act, 1922</i> defined infanticide in terms <span class=GramE>that are</span> similar to the present definition in Canada.  That definition established the often criticized connection between mothers
    who kill their newborn children and mental disturbance attributed to the act of
    giving birth.  The <i>Infanticide Act,</i> <i>1922 </i>further
    provided that those convicted of infanticide were to be sentenced as if guilty
    of manslaughter.  The legislation thereby
    removed the mandatory death penalty and gave trial judges a wide sentencing
    discretion that would permit the imposition of a sentence that accurately
    reflected the mother’s culpability in the specific circumstances of the case.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    partial defence to a murder charge.  The
    section provided that on a murder trial where the jury was satisfied that
    infanticide was made out, the jury could:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[N]otwithstanding that the circumstances were such
    that but for this Act the offence would have amounted to murder, return in lieu

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In carving infanticide out from the definition
    of murder and treating it as a distinct and less culpable offence, Parliament attempted
    to bring the law into line with the community’s sense of fairness and justice
    as expressed through the verdicts of numerous juries:  see P. Devlin, <i>Trial by Jury</i> (London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1956), at p. 160.  The creation of a distinct, less culpable
    form of homicide, applicable to mothers who killed their newborns while
    suffering a mental disturbance related to birth, is an example of the
    application of the principle of fair labelling in criminal law.  The fair labelling principle dictates that
    two types of conduct that are both regarded by the community as worthy of a criminal
    sanction, but are seen as significantly different in terms of culpability, should
    be identified and treated as different substantive crimes subject to different
    penalties that reflect the different level of moral culpability.  Fair labelling promotes public confidence in
    and support for the administration of criminal justice:  A. Ashworth, <i>Principles of Criminal Law</i>, 5th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University
    Press, 2006), at pp. 88-90. </p>

    Act, 1938</i> (Appendix “A”).  The <i>Infanticide Act, 1938</i> maintains
    infanticide’s unique status as both a separate offence and a partial defence to
    murder:  <i>R. v. Gore</i>, [2007] EWCA Crim 2789, at para. 20; Law Commission, <i>Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide</i>, at

    Canadian infanticide legislation in 1948 demonstrate that the same factors that
    motivated the English legislation in 1922 were at play in Canada in 1948:  see <i>House
    of Commons Debates</i>, 1948, Vol. V (June 14, 1948), at pp. 5184-87.  Like their English counterparts, Canadian
    juries were reluctant to brand mothers as murderers, many of whom were very young,
    emotionally distraught, and in dire social and economic circumstances at the
    time of the homicide.  As in the United
    Kingdom, the death penalty was mandatory for all murders in Canada in 1948.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The initial Canadian legislation (Appendix “B”) closely
    tracked the <i>Infanticide Act, 1922</i>, even
    to the point of ignoring the changes made by the <i>Infanticide Act, 1938</i>.  Section 262(2) introduced infanticide into the <i>Criminal Code</i> and, like its English counterpart, tied the concept
    to mental disturbance arising from the act of giving birth:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A woman who by wilful act or omission causes the
    death of her newly born child <i>shall be
    deemed not to have committed murder or manslaughter</i> if at the time of the
    act or omission she had not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to
    such child and by reason thereof the balance of her mind was then disturbed,
    but shall be deemed to have committed an indictable offence, namely,
    infanticide.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike the English legislation, the Canadian
    provisions did not treat infanticide as manslaughter for the purposes of
    sentencing.  Instead, s. 268A provided
    for a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment.  The three-year maximum penalty for
    infanticide clearly marked it as significantly less culpable than murder, and
    less culpable even than manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 262(2) expressly declared that culpable
    homicide that fell within the definition of infanticide was to be “deemed” not
    to be murder or manslaughter.  I take the
    word “deemed” to signal that Parliament intended that culpable homicides which
    had formerly constituted murder or manslaughter should now be regarded by law
    as infanticide and not murder or manslaughter if those homicides fell within
    the language of the infanticide provision.  Consequently, for the purposes of applying the included offences
    provision in s. 951(2) (now s. 662(3)), a culpable homicide that fell within
    the definition of infanticide was deemed not to be murder, meaning that the
    Crown had failed to prove murder if the homicide came within the definition of infanticide.
     As murder had not been proved, it was
    open to the jury under the included offence provision to return a verdict on
    the included offence of infanticide.  I
    think the 1948 legislation, while perhaps not as clearly worded as the <i>Infanticide Act, 1922</i>, nonetheless makes
    it clear that infanticide was brought into the <i>Criminal Code</i> as both a stand alone indictable offence and a
    partial defence to a murder charge.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Five changes to the infanticide provisions can
    be found in the over 750 sections making up the new <i>Criminal Code</i>.  I think only
    one of the five amendments is germane to the present inquiry.  That amendment removed the phrase, “shall be
    deemed not to have committed murder or manslaughter” from the section defining
    infanticide.  I will, however, describe
    the other four amendments before addressing the deletion of the deeming
    provision from the definition of infanticide.      </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The penalty for infanticide was increased from
    three to five years as part of the standardization of maximum penalties under
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>:  1953-54<i> Criminal Code</i>, s. 208.  That
    standardization eliminated potential maximums between two and five years:  <i>House
    of Commons Debates</i>, 1953-54, Vol. III (February 25, 1954), at p. 2446.  In my view, the increase in maximum penalty
    does not speak to any reassessment of the blameworthiness of the crime of
    infanticide.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The phrase, “newly born child” was defined as a
    child <span class=GramE>under</span> one year of age.  This amendment corresponded to an amendment
    made by the <i>Infanticide Act, 1938</i> in
    England, and overrode the narrow meaning that had been given to the phrase,
    “newly born child” by the English and Canadian courts:  <i>R. v.
    O’Donoghue</i> (1928), 20 Cr. App. R. 132 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Marchello</i> (1951), 100 C.C.C. 137 (Ont. H.C.).  There was no mention of this amendment in the
    debates.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The amendments also introduced the effect of
    lactation as a second source of mental disturbance that could support the
    offence of infanticide.  This amendment was
    also taken from the <i>Infanticide Act, 1938</i> that had introduced the effect of lactation into the English infanticide law.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The 1954 amendments also introduced s. 570 into
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  That amendment, unlike the amendments referred
    to above, was a Canadian original and does not appear to have any counterpart
    in other commonwealth legislation.  Section 570 (now s. 663) provided:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where a female person is charged with infanticide
    and the evidence establishes that she caused the death of her child but does
    not establish that, at the time of the act or omission by which she caused the
    death of the child,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>she was not fully recovered from the effects of
    giving birth to the child or from the effect of lactation consequent to the
    birth of the child, and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>the balance of her mind was, at that time,
    disturbed by reason of the effect of giving birth to the child or the effect of
    lactation consequent on the birth of the child,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=GramE>she</span> may be convicted unless
    the evidence establishes that the act or omission was not wilful.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 570 was a direct response to the criticisms
    of the 1948 legislation made by Chief Justice McRuer in <i>Marchello</i> at pp. 141-42.  In that
    case, a woman was charged with murdering her four and a half month old child.  She was found not guilty on account of
    insanity.  Chief Justice McRuer did not
    leave infanticide with the jury as, in his <span class=GramE>view,</span> a four
    and a half month old child was not a “newly born child” within the meaning of
    the infanticide provision.  After the
    trial was completed, Chief Justice McRuer delivered a judgment that had nothing
    to do with the facts in <i>Marchello</i>,
    but was a cogent criticism of the infanticide provision.  He observed that where a mother was charged
    with infanticide (not the charge in <i>Marchello</i>),
    she would be acquitted outright if the Crown failed to prove either aspect of the
    mental disturbance component of infanticide.  This could mean that a mother who intentionally, and after calm and careful
    consideration, decided to kill her child, would escape criminal liability altogether
    if charged only with infanticide.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 570 sought to correct the shortcomings
    identified in <i>Marchello</i>.  It is an unusual, if not unique, provision in
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Section 570 (now s. 663) not only absolves
    the Crown from proving an element of the offence of infanticide (the mental
    disorder component)<span class=GramE>,</span> it also appears to transfer the
    onus of proof on the issue of wilfulness to the defence.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are potential constitutional problems with
    s. 570 (now s. 663).  Those problems do
    not arise in this case.  By its terms, s.
    570 applies only where “a female person is charged with infanticide”.  The respondent was charged with first degree
    murder, not infanticide.  Where the Crown
    proceeds on a murder charge, there is no danger that the mother will escape
    liability if the only thing lacking in the Crown’s case is evidence of a mental
    disturbance arising out of the birth of the child.  Assuming the Crown proves beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the mother caused the child’s death by an unlawful act, any absence
    of evidence supporting a mental disturbance required for infanticide would lead
    either to a murder or manslaughter conviction, depending on whether the Crown
    proved the <i>mens rea</i> for murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 570 (now s. 663) was designed to deal
    with a very specific problem that arose only in cases where infanticide was the
    charged offence.  That section does not assist
    me in determining whether Parliament intended to remove infanticide as a
    partial defence to murder when it amended the infanticide provisions in 1954.    </p>

    amendment to the infanticide provisions is best demonstrated by comparing the
    language of s. 204 in the 1953-54 <i>Criminal
    Code</i> with the language in its predecessor provision, s. 262(2).  I have highlighted the portions deleted from
    the earlier legislation by the amendment:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 204 removed both deeming provisions from
    s. 262(2).  The removal of the second
    deeming provision, “but shall be deemed to have committed an indictable
    offence, namely, infanticide” effected no substantive change.  The deleted language was replaced by the clearer,
    straightforward phrase, “a female person commits infanticide when ...” that
    appears at the beginning of s. 204.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The removal of the phrase “shall be deemed not
    to have committed murder or manslaughter” from the infanticide provision is
    more problematic.  That phrase had made
    it clear that infanticide acted as a partial defence to murder by declaring
    that a culpable homicide that was infanticide would be “deemed” not to be
    murder.  The removal of the deeming
    language obscures that intention to some extent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In determining whether the removal of the
    deeming language meant that infanticide was not a partial defence to murder, I start
    from the premise that, for the reasons outlined above, it was Parliament’s
    intention to make infanticide a partial defence to murder under the 1948
    legislation.  The Crown must convince the
    court that the removal of the deeming language signalled Parliament’s intention
    to fundamentally alter the nature of infanticide by removing it as a potential partial
    defence to murder.  If that was indeed
    the purpose behind the removal of the deeming language, it seems to me that
    Parliament chose to achieve its purpose in a somewhat indirect fashion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In assessing the effect of the 1954 amendment, I
    bear in mind that infanticide had been introduced into the <i>Criminal Code</i> only about six years earlier.  That introduction was precipitated by the perceived
    need to give juries trying murder cases involving mothers who killed their
    children an alternative to a murder verdict that more accurately reflected the
    jury’s sense of the true culpability of the mother.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the Crown’s argument, by removing the deeming
    provision, Parliament effectively undid the very purpose for which the
    infanticide provision had been introduced six years earlier.  If the Crown is correct, juries facing
    mothers charged with murder after the 1954 amendments would find themselves back
    in exactly the same predicament that juries had faced prior to the introduction
    of the infanticide law in 1948.  If the
    Crown proved the essential elements of murder, the jury would be required to
    convict of murder even though the circumstances brought the offence within the
    less blameworthy crime of infanticide.  It
    would take strong evidence to satisfy me that Parliament intended to abandon
    the very purpose behind the infanticide legislation less than six years after
    enacting that legislation, and that it intended to give to the prosecutorial
    authorities, through their charging discretion, the exclusive power to
    determine whether a mother who killed her newborn child could be convicted of
    infanticide and not murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a presumption that when Parliament
    changes legislation it does so for a purpose.  That purpose may, however, vary from benign housekeeping concerns to the
    intention to make a fundamental change in the law:  Sullivan, at pp. 579-86.  The nature of the legislation effecting the
    amendment can assist in determining the purpose behind any specific
    change.  Referring specifically to the
    amendments made to the <i>Criminal Code</i> in 1954, Professor Sullivan has commented, at p. 585:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Particularly where an older statute is given a major
    overhaul, as was the case with the 1953-54 <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, <i>it may be clear that even
    dramatic changes in wording are meant to simplify or otherwise modernize the
    style rather than to change the substance of the provision.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I find nothing in the debates surrounding the
    introduction <span class=GramE>of the 1953-54 <i>Criminal Code</i></span> referring to the deletion of the deeming
    language from the infanticide provision, much less anything suggesting that, in
    doing so, Parliament intended to remove infanticide as a partial defence to
    murder.  Nor have I found anything in the
    secondary sources contemporary to the amendments suggesting Parliament intended
    to remove infanticide as a partial defence.  For example, J.C. Martin, Q.C., the editor of <i>Martin’s Criminal Code 1955</i> (the first <i>Martin’s</i> <i>Criminal Code</i>),
    outlined the amendments made by the 1953-54 <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> at length in his introduction (Toronto:
    Cartwright &amp; Sons, 1955).  At pp.
    10-11, he described the changes to the infanticide amendments.  His commentary does not suggest any change in
    the fundamental nature of infanticide.  In his comments under the infanticide section itself, Mr. Martin
    observes, at p. 392: “The present section, with the definition mentioned, [the definition
    of newly born child] is taken from the <i>Infanticide
    Act, 1938</i>, (U.K.).”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    charged with the task of revising the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, and one of the drafters of the revision.  I would not have expected Mr. Martin to
    connect the 1954 amendments to the <i>Infanticide
    Act, 1938</i>, which clearly recognized infanticide as a partial defence to
    murder, if Mr. Martin perceived that the 1954 amendments had removed
    infanticide as a partial defence.  </p>

    tripartite division of culpable homicide into murder, manslaughter and
    infanticide created by the infanticide amendments in 1948.  Nor did it alter the very different levels of
    culpability applicable to each of the forms of culpable homicide as represented
    by the potential penalties.  Parliament clearly
    intended to maintain the distinction between homicides that constituted murder
    and the much narrower category of homicides that constituted infanticide.  That distinction, unlike the distinction between
    murder and manslaughter, did not depend on the mental element, but turned on
    the existence of specific facts peculiar to infanticide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Treating infanticide as a partial defence to
    murder is consistent with the distinction drawn between infanticide and murder
    by Parliament.  It allows juries to draw
    that distinction in cases where mothers are charged with murdering their
    children and evidence brings the homicide within the very narrow factual
    confines of infanticide.  Eliminating infanticide
    as a partial defence effectively allows the Crown to remove the distinction
    between infanticide and murder through the exercise of its charging
    discretion.  </p>

    statutory interpretation leads me to conclude that Parliament intended to make
    infanticide a partial defence to murder when it introduced infanticide into the <i>Criminal Code</i> in 1948.  Parliament did not intend to alter the status
    of infanticide by the 1954 amendments.  Infanticide was initially, and still is, both a stand alone indictable
    offence and a partial defence to a charge of murder.  </p>

    with the jury where the evidence gave that defence “an air of reality”.  Proulx J.A. did not examine the nature of the

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, not only should section 662(3) be
    interpreted as permitting a finding of infanticide even when murder is proved,
    section 233 should be read as providing that where the elements of infanticide
    are present, the offence is infanticide <i>and
    not murder</i>.  This interpretation is
    not re-writing section 233 but rather giving it an interpretation that provides
    both murder and infanticide with a role to play in the scheme of culpable
    homicide.  In other words, a finding of
    infanticide should rule out a finding of murder.  This is in fact how the original infanticide provision
    was drafted in Canada…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The removal of the reference to manslaughter and

    has been the accepted wisdom in Canada since infanticide became part of the
    criminal law that it operates as both an offence and a partial defence to
    murder.  There is merit to the Crown’s
    claim that infanticide has operated in this dual capacity more by way of
    assumption than as a result of any critical analysis of the relevant <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions.  This appeal has forced that critical
    analysis.  I am satisfied that the
    analysis supports the long held assumption.  Infanticide is both a discrete indictable offence and a partial defence
    to murder under the terms of the present <i>Criminal

    so operate, and if so under what terms, raises difficult policy questions.  Those questions are for Parliament and not

    rely on the word “wilful” in s. 233, the language of the 1948 provision, an <i>obiter</i> statement in <i>Creighton</i>, and trial decisions, <i>e.g.</i> <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d)

    respondent’s and intervener’s reliance on the word “wilful” in s. 233 is
    understandable.  “Wilful” is a strong <i>mens rea</i> word and can be understood to
    require proof of an intention to bring about the prohibited consequence, <i>e.g.</i> death, even where, as in s. 233, on
    a plain grammatical reading “wilful” modifies the phrase “act or omission” and
    not the phrase “causes death”:  <i>R. v. Docherty</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 941, at
    pp. 949-50; M. Manning &amp; P. Sankoff, <i>Manning,
    Mewett &amp; Sankoff: Criminal Law</i>, 4th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2009), at
    p. 173.  However, the <i>Criminal Code</i> is notoriously
    inconsistent in the manner in which it uses <i>mens
    rea</i> words.  This court has recognized
    that “wilful” can have different meanings in different sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:  <i>R. v.
    Buzzanga and Durocher</i> (1979), 25 O.R. (2d) 705 (C.A.), at p. 717.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Buzzanga</i>, this court stressed that
    the meaning of “wilful” in one section of the <i>Criminal Code</i> could be influenced by the <i>mens rea</i> language of clearly related <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions.  The <i>mens rea</i> for murder is
    expressly set out in the language of s. 229(a).  The word “wilful” is not used.  The use of very different <i>mens rea</i> language in s. 229, as compared to the word “wilful” in s. 233, suggests that Parliament
    did not intend to equate the <i>mens rea</i> required for murder (s. 229) with the <i>mens
    rea</i> required for infanticide (s. 233).  While the word “wilful” figures in any analysis of the <i>mens rea</i> for infanticide, I do not think
    that word alone is determinative of the <i>mens
    rea</i> required for infanticide.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also cannot accept that the comment by McLachlin J. in <i>Creighton</i> has determined the <i>mens
    rea</i> of infanticide.  <i>Creighton</i> was a case about the <i>mens rea</i> of manslaughter and the
    constitutionality of that offence.  McLachlin J. introduced her examination of the <i>mens rea</i> of manslaughter with this observation, at pp. 41-42:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The <i>Criminal
    Code</i> defines three general types of culpable homicide.  There is murder, the intentional killing of
    another human being.  There is
    infanticide, the intentional killing of a child.  All other culpable homicides fall into the
    residual category of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    cannot read the single sentence referable to infanticide in <i>Creighton</i> as a definitive and all
    encompassing description of the <i>mens rea</i> of that offence.  The case had nothing to
    do with infanticide.  I take the sentence
    to be merely an indication that an intentional killing of a child can be
    infanticide.  That is not the same thing
    as saying that to constitute infanticide, the killing of the child must be
    intentional in the same way that murder must be intentional.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    analysis of the <i>mens rea</i> requirement
    for manslaughter in <i>Creighton</i> at pp. 45-49
    does, however, <span class=GramE>provides</span> assistance as to the approach
    to be taken in determining the <i>mens rea</i> for infanticide.  In considering whether foresight
    of bodily harm, the <i>mens rea</i> required
    for manslaughter, met constitutional standards, McLachlin J., for the majority,
    observed that the <i>mens rea</i> of an
    offence should reflect the gravity of the crime and the societal stigma
    attached to the commission of the particular crime.  The penalties provided by Parliament afforded
    a measure of the gravity of an offence and the stigma associated with its
    commission.  McLachlin J. concluded that
    as manslaughter, unlike murder, carried no mandatory sentence, a <i>mens rea</i> that did not require proof of
    intention was consistent with the gravity of the offence and the stigma
    attached to the commission of the offence by the community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    five-year potential maximum penalty for infanticide is far removed from the
    mandatory minimum life sentence for murder and is significantly less than even the
    maximum penalty of life imprisonment available for manslaughter.  To the extent that the potential penalty
    provides insight into the requisite <i>mens
    rea</i>, the five-year maximum penalty for infanticide strongly suggests a <i>mens rea</i> closer to the manslaughter requirement
    of foresight of harm than to the murder requirement of an intention to kill or
    foresight of probable death.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Considering
    the homicide provisions as a whole and the obvious hierarchy created by those
    provisions, I do not think that the infanticide provision can be read as
    requiring proof of the same <i>mens rea</i> as that required for murder.  Instead, a <i>mens rea</i> for infanticide akin to that
    for manslaughter is much more consistent with the hierarchy of culpable
    homicides established in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  In my view, infanticide as a
    form of culpable <span class=GramE>homicide,</span> should require the <i>mens rea</i> required for manslaughter.  There is nothing inherent in the seriousness
    of the offence or the stigma attached to it which requires the imposition of a
    higher <i>mens rea</i> like that required
    for murder.  That, of course, is not to
    say that a mother who intends to kill her child is, therefore, not guilty of
    infanticide.  Clearly, a person who intends
    to kill foresees the risk of bodily harm to the child and, therefore, has the
    required <i>mens rea</i> for either
    manslaughter or infanticide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    infanticide was read as requiring proof of the same <i>mens rea</i> as murder, circumstances could produce anomalous
    results.  For example, if infanticide
    requires the <i>mens rea</i> for murder, a
    mother who intends to kill her child but whose conduct comes within the meaning
    of infanticide would be convicted of infanticide, the least culpable form of culpable
    homicide.  A second mother, whose conduct
    also comes within the meaning of infanticide, but who was <span class=GramE>so</span> emotionally distraught as to be incapable of forming the intention for murder, could
    not be convicted of infanticide but would instead be convicted of manslaughter,
    a more serious offence.  Surely, a mother
    who does not intend to kill her child should not be regarded as having
    committed a more culpable homicide than the mother who did have that intention.  This anomaly disappears if the <i>mens rea</i> for infanticide captures both
    the mother who intends to kill and the mother who unlawfully assaults her child
    in circumstances where bodily harm to the child is foreseeable.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a second, and I think significant, practical problem with treating the <i>mens rea</i> for infanticide as the same as
    that required for murder.  Infanticide
    requires evidence that the mother’<span style='"Times New Roman"'>s
    mind was “disturbed” at the time of the homicide.  Evidence proffered by the defence to meet the
    evidentiary burden on that issue will, in some cases, </span>cast doubt on
    whether the mother intended to kill her child.  If infanticide operates as a partial defence to murder only where the <i>mens rea</i> for murder exists, the very
    same evidence offered to bring the mother within the infanticide defence could push
    her outside of that defence by negating the intention to kill or the existence
    of foresight as to the likelihood of death.  If the <i>mens rea</i> for
    infanticide is interpreted as including the <i>mens
    rea</i> required for murder or manslaughter, the defence is not put in the
    position of offering evidence of the mother<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span>s mental state that could simultaneously support and
    undermine the infanticide defence.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    think treating the <i>mens rea</i> for
    infanticide as reaching not only an intention to kill, but also objective
    foresight of bodily harm, provides a coherent and comprehensive reading of the
    homicide provisions that best reflects the relative seriousness of the three
    levels of culpable homicide created in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  This approach does give the
    word “wilful” a meaning that is somewhat inconsistent with its customary
    meaning.  I am satisfied, however, that a
    coherent and workable reading of s. 233 in the context of the homicide
    provisions supports my interpretation of the word “wilful” in this context.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    I reach my conclusion as to the <i>mens rea</i> of infanticide based on the language of the present <i>Criminal Code</i>, I am fortified in that view by the language of the
    original provision in 1948 (Appendix B).  Section 262(2) provided that a woman who committed what was defined as
    infanticide “shall be deemed not to have committed murder or
    manslaughter”.  That section contemplated
    that infanticide, the new category of culpable homicide, would include
    homicides that had previously been murders or had previously been
    manslaughters.  The intention to cover
    both is even clearer when one bears in mind that the <i>Infanticide Act, 1922</i> in England referred only to homicides that
    “would have amounted to murder” in the provision creating infanticide.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lastly,
    I draw support for my conclusion concerning the <i>mens rea</i> of infanticide from the recent decision of the English
    Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Gore</i>,<i> </i>[2007] EWCA Crim 2789, the only
    appellate decision of which I am aware in this country or England that has
    addressed the <i>mens rea</i> of
    infanticide.  The court’s interpretation
    focused on the words “wilful act or omission” and “notwithstanding that the
    circumstances were such that but for this act the offence would have amounted
    to murder” in s. 1(1) of the <i>Infanticide
    Act, 1938</i>.  The court concluded, at paras.
    33-34:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>We are
    satisfied that Parliament intended to create a new offence of infanticide which
    covered situations much wider than offences that would otherwise be murder.</i>  If the criteria in subsection (1) [<i>Infanticide Act, 1938</i>] are fulfilled,
    the mother who kills her child does not have to face an indictment for
    murder.  She faces a lower grade criminal
    charge, namely infanticide.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The <i>mens rea</i> for the offence of infanticide is contained, as we see it, explicitly in the
    first few words of section 1(1), namely the prosecution must prove that the
    defendant acted or omitted to act wilfully.  There is no reference to any intention to kill or cause serious bodily
    harm. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his case comment on <i>Gore</i>, Professor
    Ashworth suggests that while the <i>mens rea</i> of infanticide had seldom been discussed in England, the assumption had been
    that it mirrored the <i>mens rea</i> for
    murder.  Professor Ashworth describes the
    Court of Appeal’s interpretation as “a benevolent and desirable interpretation”.  He posits the rhetorical question “why should
    the mother whose offence would otherwise be unlawful act manslaughter not have
    the benefit of the infanticide offence?<span class=GramE>”:</span>  see A. Ashworth, “Infanticide: Whether Mens
    Rea of Infanticide Consists of an Intention to Kill or Cause Grievous Bodily
    Harm” (2008) 5 Crim. L. R. 388, at pp. 390-91.<a

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons set out above, I do not think that the <i>mens rea</i> for infanticide can be equated with the <i>mens rea</i> for murder.  In my view, to prove infanticide, the Crown
    must establish the <i>mens rea</i> associated
    with the unlawful act that caused the child’s death and objective
    foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm to the child from that assault.  On this approach, it is the unique <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> of
    infanticide that distinguishes it from murder and manslaughter.  Those distinctions are what caused Parliament
    to treat infanticide as a culpable homicide, but one that was significantly
    less culpable than murder and even manslaughter.  The presence of the <i>mens rea</i> for murder, while not negating the partial defence of infanticide,
    is not a condition precedent to the existence of that partial defence. </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[A]n accused person who seeks to rely on the defence
    of infanticide must bear the burden of proving its elements on a balance of
    probabilities (just as an accused who seeks to rely on s. 16 or automatism, or

    the accused in the case at bar to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the trial judge referred to the “elements” of infanticide, I think it is clear

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to stress that the trial judge was addressing onus in the context
    of infanticide as a partial defence and not in the context of infanticide as a
    stand alone charge.  The onus of proof
    where infanticide is charged raises different questions in light of s.
    663.  Those questions do not arise on
    this appeal.  Like the trial judge, my
    reasons address the onus exclusively in reference to the partial defence of
    infanticide.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    presumption of innocence, constitutionally protected by s. 11(d) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>,
    requires that the Crown prove the essential elements of the crime alleged
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  It also
    requires that the Crown negate potential defences to the same standard of
    proof:  see <i>R. v. Whyte</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3, at p. 18; <i>R. v. Keegstra</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 789-90; <i>R. v. Wholesale Travel Group</i>, [1991] 3
    S.C.R. 154, at pp. 195-97.  Thus, for
    example, on a murder charge where there is evidence of provocation, s. 11(d)
    requires both that the Crown prove the essential elements of murder beyond a
    reasonable doubt and that it prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence
    of provocation is not available.  To
    negate the defence of provocation, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable
    doubt that at least one of the constituent elements of the defence is not
    available on the evidence:  D. Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal Law: <span class=GramE>A</span> Treatise</i>, 5th ed. (Scarborough: Thomson Carswell, 2007), at pp. 570-71; <i>R. v. Tran</i>, 2010 SCC 58, at para. 81. </p>

    the trial judge appreciated, any deviation from the requirement that the Crown
    bear the burden of proof is a <i>prima facie</i> violation of s. 11(d), and is constitutional only if justified under s. 1 of
    the <i>Charter</i> which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The<i> Canadian

    case and held that the Crown bore the burden to disprove the partial defence of
    infanticide.  In her analysis (paras.
    13-18), she doubted whether a judge-made requirement that the accused establish
    the necessary disturbance of the mind on the balance of probabilities could be
    said to be a limit on the presumption of innocence “prescribed by law”.  I share her doubts.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span

    limit on a <i>Charter</i> right may be found
    in a statute or other legislative instrument either expressly or by necessary
    implication:  <i>R. v. Swain</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, at p. 968; <i>R. v. Thomsen</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, at pp. 650-55.  The infanticide provisions do not contain any
    express reversal of the burden of proof or otherwise purport to limit the
    application of s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Nor can any limit be read by necessary
    implication into any statutory provision relevant to infanticide.  Section 16(4), which reverses the onus where
    an accused raises an “insanity” defence, has no application to
    infanticide.  As Veit J. explains,
    infanticide is “<i>sui generis</i>” and
    cannot be viewed as a variation on the mental disorder requirement of the
    “insanity” defence:  <i>Effert</i>, at para. 17.  The
    reversal of the burden where “insanity” is raised does not imply anything about
    the appropriate burden where infanticide is raised.</p>

    645.  Potential common law limits on <i>Charter</i> rights must be approached
    cautiously, particularly where the common law limit is created post-<i>Charter</i>.  A cautious approach is dictated because judge-made common law
    limitations are not the product of the same considered and public weighing and

    find it particularly difficult to resort to the common law to overlay a
    constitutional limit on what is a statutory defence.  I would have thought that if a reversal of
    the onus in relation to the partial defence of infanticide was viewed as a justifiable
    limit on the presumption of innocence, Parliament would have taken steps to
    write that limit into the statutory defence.  To analogize to the caution sounded by Binnie J., speaking in dissent,
    in <i>R. v. Stone</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290,
    at para. 50, a court should not organize its own s. 1 justification for a <i>Charter</i> violation where Parliament in

    the common law as imposing a justifiable limit on s. 11(d).  However, neither case involved a limit on a
    statutorily created defence.  Both were
    cases in which the courts were addressing issues, the voluntariness component
    of the <i>actus <span class=GramE>reus</span></i> and <i>mens rea</i> of crimes, that have
    traditionally been shaped by judicial interpretation and not Parliamentary
    pronouncement.  Even then, as the
    powerful dissent of Binnie J. in <i>Stone</i> demonstrates, judicially created limits on something as fundamental as the

    if the court could invoke the common law to limit the presumption of innocence
    as it applies to the statutory defence of infanticide, I see no justification
    for doing so.  My research reveals that
    in every jurisdiction in which the partial defence of infanticide is recognized,
    neither the legislature nor the courts have seen fit to relieve the Crown of
    its customary burden of proof.  There is
    no suggestion in the case law or commentary from those jurisdictions that bearing
    the burden of proof has posed a difficult, much less insurmountable, burden for
    the Crown.  Indeed, I do not understand
    the Crown on this appeal to have argued that it cannot realistically be
    expected to meet the customary burden of proof where the defence of infanticide
    is in play.  </p>

    required for the infanticide defence.  That
    problem arises whenever the Crown must prove or disprove a certain state of
    mind.  It should not be viewed as an

    placed on individual freedom, the value underlying the constitutional right to

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    an accused advances an infanticide defence to a murder charge, I am satisfied
    there will be ample evidence available of the circumstances surrounding the child’s
    death and the mother’s mental condition at the time to permit a full inquiry at
    trial into that mental condition.  A trial
    judge has various means available to him or her to ensure that the Crown has a
    full opportunity to challenge any defence evidence offered and to advance its
    own evidence on the infanticide issue.  Certainly, the evidence adduced in this case does not suggest that the
    Crown had any difficulty fully litigating the question of whether the
    respondent’s killing of her children was infanticide or murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no justification for limiting the respondent’s constitutional right to be
    presumed innocent of the charge of murder.  Assuming a sufficient evidentiary basis to give the infanticide claim an
    air of reality, the respondent was entitled to be acquitted on the murder
    charge and convicted of the included offence of infanticide unless the Crown could
    negate the defence of infanticide beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <h2>(c) The Approach to Be Taken Where Infanticide
    Is Raised as a Defence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Resolution
    of the issues raised on this appeal allows me to set out the approach that
    should be taken when infanticide is advanced as a defence to murder.  As the vast majority of murder cases involve
    trials by jury, I will set out the appropriate approach in the context of a
    jury trial where the accused is charged with first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Like
    any defence, infanticide is put to the jury only if there is sufficient
    evidence to give that defence an air of reality.  If the defence goes to the jury, instructions
    along the following line should be given:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jury should first decide whether the Crown
    has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused caused the child<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>'</span>s death.  If the Crown has failed to do so, the accused
    must be acquitted.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;page-break-after:
avoid;'><span style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the Crown proves causation, the jury next
    decides whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that in causing
    the child’s death the accused committed culpable homicide as defined in s.
    225.  This will most often involve
    proving that the accused committed an unlawful act.  The unlawful act will usually be an
    assault.  If the Crown fails to prove a
    culpable homicide, the accused must be acquitted.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the Crown proves that the accused committed a
    culpable homicide, the jury must then decide the nature of the culpable
    homicide.  The jury should be told to
    consider infanticide first.  If the Crown
    fails to negate at least one of the elements of infanticide beyond a reasonable
    doubt, the jury should be instructed to return a verdict of not guilty of
    murder, but guilty of infanticide.  </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the Crown does negate infanticide, the jury
    should be told to go on and consider whether the Crown has proved murder.  If the Crown proves murder, then the jury
    should be instructed to determine whether the murder is first or second degree
    murder.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the Crown fails to prove murder, the jury
    should be instructed to return a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of
    manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='page-break-after:avoid'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying
    the approach outlined above to the facts of this case, it was conceded that the
    respondent caused her children’s deaths and that in doing so she committed a
    culpable homicide.  Those concessions
    take one to the point where the culpable homicide must be categorized.  The trial judge found on the balance of
    probabilities that the respondent met the criteria for infanticide in respect
    of both homicides.  That finding negated any
    argument that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one
    of the elements of infanticide was not present.  The trial judge, therefore, returned the proper verdicts – not guilty of
    murder but guilty of infanticide.</p>

    strategy at trial, including admissions made by the defence, was predicated on
    the availability of infanticide as a partial defence to murder.  Counsel accepts that if she convinces this
    court that infanticide is not a partial defence, L.B. should have an
    opportunity to defend the murder allegations with the knowledge that infanticide
    is not a partial defence.  </p>

    infanticide is inconsistent with other defences, such as duress, fails to take
    into account that infanticide does not excuse or justify what would otherwise
    be criminal conduct.  It simply declares
    the conduct to be a separate and less culpable crime than murder.  If there is a comparable defence, it must be
    provocation.   </p>

    judges and juries saw infanticide as substantially less blameworthy than other
    murders.  Various explanations are
    discussed by various commentators.  That
    discussion, while thought provoking, does not impact on my interpretation of
    the statutes:  <i>e.g.</i> see J. A. Osborne, “The Crime of Infanticide: Throwing Out the
    Baby with the Bathwater” (1987) 6 Can. J. Fam. L. 47; K. O’Donovan “The
    Medicalisation of Infanticide” (1984) Crim. L. R. 259; C. Backhouse, “Desperate
    Women and Compassionate Courts: Infanticide in Nineteenth-Century Canada”

    always of doubtful medical validity, was an attempt to expand the availability
    of infanticide beyond child homicides involving babies who were only a few hours
    or days old:  see New South Wales Law
    Reform Commission, <i>Partial Defences to
    Murder:  Provocation and Infanticide</i> (Report 83) (Sydney: New South Wales Law Reform Commission, 1997), at para.

    presently pending before the Alberta Court of Appeal.  In that case, the accused was charged with
    murder and advanced an infanticide “defence”.  She was convicted of murder and the Alberta Court of Appeal ordered a
    new trial:  <i>R. v. Effert</i>, 2007 ABCA 284.  The accused was convicted of murder a second time and her second appeal
    is now pending hearing in the Alberta Court of Appeal.  As I read the various trial judgments
    reported, the endorsement of the Alberta Court of Appeal on the first appeal,
    and the facta that have been filed on the second appeal, the Crown has never
    questioned the availability of infanticide as a partial defence to a murder
    charge:  see <i>R. v .Effert</i> (2009), 244 C.C.C. (3d) 510 (Alta. Q.B.), at para. 1.</p>

    law commissions in the Australian states, as well as the Law Commission in
    England. The Victorian Law Reform Commission first examined the issue of
    infanticide in <i>Mental Malfunction and
    Criminal Responsibility</i> (Report No. 34) (Melbourne: Victorian Law Reform
    Commission, 1990). The issue was considered again in <i>Defences to Homicide: Final Report</i> (Melbourne: Victorian Law Reform
    Commission, 2004).  In both reports, the
    Victorian Law Reform Commission recommended that infanticide be retained as an
    offence and as a partial defence. However, in its 2004 report, the Commission
    recommended that the reference to lactation be removed and the age limit of the
    child be raised to two years (pp. 266-67).  The law in Victoria was changed in accordance with these recommendations
    in 2005: <i>Crimes (Homicide) Act 2005</i> (Vic), s. 5. This “minimal reform” approach was provisionally recommended by
    the Law Reform Commission in England in <span class=GramE><i>A</i></span><i> New Homicide Act for
    England and Wales?  A Consultation Paper</i> (Consultation Paper No. 177) (London: Law Commission, 2005), at paras.
    9.75-9.78. However, in its final report, <i>Murder,
    Manslaughter and Infanticide</i> (Law Com. No. 304) (London: Law Commission,
    2006), at para. 8.23, the Law Commission recommended that the “offence/defence”
    of infanticide be retained in England without amendment.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Conversely, the Law Reform Commission of Western
    Australia recommended that the infanticide provisions be repealed in Western
    Australia in its <i>Review of the Law of
    Homicide</i> (Final Report Project 97) (Perth: Law Reform Commission of Western
    Australia, 2007), at pp. 114-17. The infanticide provisions were repealed in
    Western Australia in 2008: <i>Criminal Law
    Amendment (Homicide) Act 2008</i> (W.A.), s. 13. The New South Wales Law Reform
    Commission has also recommended that its state’s infanticide provisions be
    repealed in <i>Partial Defences to
    Murder:  Provocation and Infanticide</i> (Report 83) (Sydney: New South Wales Law Reform Commission, 1997), at para.
    3.14. However, this recommendation was conditional on there being a defence of
    diminished responsibility available in some form in New South Wales. The
    infanticide provisions in New South Wales have not been repealed.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>In October 2004, the Law Commission of New Zealand was
    directed to review criminal defences including infanticide. Thus far, however,
    the Law Commission has restricted its review to the defence of insanity and has
    yet to address the issue of infanticide.</p>
