    December 13, 2009. She noticed a man walking behind her. As she reached the
    front door of the building, she noticed the same man running towards her. He
    grabbed her and said “Give me your keys”. He then grabbed her hand in which she
    was holding the keys. Ms. Carrier fought back, grabbing her assailant’s shirt,
    hitting him on the head, and kneeing him in the groin area. The assailant
    backed away and then left empty-handed.</span></p>

    car-jacking. Almost immediately, he saw a man fitting this description walking
    on the sidewalk on Montreal Road. Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Pulfer</span> pulled over and started to talk to the man, who identified himself as Justin

    Adrian Benjamin arrived in a second police cruiser. The suspect became
    belligerent. The officers formally arrested him shortly after he was first
    observed at 2:03 a.m. The officers searched the suspect and discovered that his
    name was Andre Wolfe-Bard. The scene of the arrest was just <span class=GramE>under</span> one kilometer from the scene of the attack.</span></p>

    Crown called three witnesses – Ms. <span class=SpellE>Carriere</span> and
    Officers <span class=SpellE>Pulfer</span> and Benjamin. The <span class=SpellE>defence</span> called one witness, the <span class=SpellE>accused’s</span> mother, Nicole
    Bard, who essentially testified that she saw her son on the street about seven
    hours before the attack at which point he was wearing an orange, not a dark, <span

    the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge, without objection from the

    that charge.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the robbery charge, the principal issue was identity. The trial judge rejected
    the complainant’s in-dock identification of the accused, saying that “it would
    be very dangerous to convict” on this basis. He also said that the
    complainant’s in-dock identification “was also quite tainted by her viewing of
    his picture on <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> a day or two after the
    robbery.”</span></p>

    the trial judge continued:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>However,
    this is a case in which there are a large number of facts, that show that it
    was in fact, the accused, who committed the robbery. I have already mentioned a
    number of them; the clothing description matched that of the accused, as did
    the facial hair description and the drunkenness and drunken walk. Add to the
    above, the accused was the only pedestrian in the area at 2:03 a.m., the
    accused was a short distance from the site of the robbery when arrested, the
    accused had a fresh cut on the top of his right hand, which could very well
    have occurred in the struggle with Ms. <span class=SpellE>Carriere</span> over
    her car keys. It is an inference I think that could very well be made in the
    particular circumstances of this case. There was only a brief period from the
    time of the robbery to the time of the arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Based
    on all the evidence in this case, I find the Crown had proven guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt and the accused will be found guilty.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    general framework within which a submission of unreasonable verdict must be
    considered was set out by <span class=SpellE>Arbour</span> J. in <i>R. v. <span class=SpellE>Biniaris</span></i>,
    [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 36:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    test for an appellate court determining whether the verdict of a jury or the
    judgment of a trial judge is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
    evidence has been unequivocally expressed in <span class=SpellE><i>Yebes</i></span> as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[C]<span class=SpellE>urial</span> review is invited whenever a jury
    goes beyond a reasonable standard. . . . [T]he test is ‘whether the verdict is
    one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have
    rendered’.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(<span
class=SpellE><i>Yebes</i></span><i>, supra</i>, at p. 185 (quoting <i>Corbett v. <span class=GramE>The Queen<span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275, at p. 282, </span>per<span
style='font-style:normal'> Pigeon J.).)</span></span></i> </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>That formulation of the test imports both an
    objective assessment and, to some extent, a subjective one.</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>  It requires the appeal court to determine what verdict a reasonable
    jury, properly instructed, could judicially have arrived at, and, in doing so,
    to review, <span class=SpellE>analyse</span> and, within the limits of
    appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence.  This latter process is usually understood as referring to a subjective
    exercise, requiring the appeal court to examine the weight of the evidence,
    rather than its bare sufficiency.   The
    test is therefore mixed, and it is more helpful to articulate what the
    application of that test entails, than to characterize it as either an objective
    or a subjective test.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the context of appellate review of a verdict in a judge alone trial, <span
class=SpellE>Arbour</span> J. further defined the task for the reviewing court,
    at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 37:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The <span class=SpellE><i>Yebes</i></span> test
    is expressed in terms of a verdict reached by a jury.  It is, however, equally applicable to the
    judgment of a judge sitting at trial without a jury. The review for
    unreasonableness on appeal is different, however, and somewhat easier when the
    judgment under attack is that of a single judge, at least when reasons for judgment
    of some substance are provided.  In those
    cases, the reviewing appellate court may be able to identify a flaw in the
    evaluation of the evidence, or in the analysis, that will serve to explain the
    unreasonable conclusion reached, and justify the reversal.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[I]n
    trials by judge alone, the court of appeal often can and should identify the
    defects in the analysis that led the <span class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact to
    an unreasonable conclusion.  The court of
    appeal will therefore be justified to intervene and set aside a verdict as
    unreasonable when the reasons of the trial judge reveal that he or she was not
    alive to an applicable legal principle, or entered a verdict inconsistent with
    the factual conclusions reached.  These
    discernable defects are themselves sometimes akin to a separate error of law,
    and therefore easily sustain the conclusion that the unreasonable verdict which
    rests upon them also raises a question of law. </span></p>

    is no doubt that there were several important similarities between the
    complainant’s description of her assailant and the suspect detained by the two
    police officers a half-hour after the attack. Three examples come immediately
    to mind – some facial hair, light-<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> blue

    in spite of these similarities, there were several discrepancies between the

    that the assailant was “more than that” and “more than” 5'8'', although she did
    not specify a new height figure. The complainant also testified that “I don’t

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.
           Yeah. He was a little bit shorter
    than me.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.
           So was he close to your height?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.
           Yeah, I said about 6'1'', 6'2''.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.
           Okay. If I’m going to suggest to
    you that he was 6'3'',   is that a fair
    assumption? Does that….</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.
           I would assume, yeah.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.
           Okay.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.
    He was a fairly tall gentleman.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    Nicole Bard, the appellant’s mother, testified that her son was 6'2'' tall.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his reasons for judgment, the trial judge referred to the complainant’s
    description in her police statement of the assailant as being 5'6'', maybe 5'8''
    and to her testimony “that on further consideration, she felt he was taller
    than five foot eight”. Later he said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to the discrepancy in her initial height estimate and the accused
    actual height, again, she was under great stress and was in the midst of
    fighting off her attacker.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge’s explanation that the complainant’s ability to observe may have
    been compromised by the circumstances of the attack was entirely reasonable. However,
    in my view, the discrepancies in evidence with respect to the assailant’s and
    appellant’s height and size are simply too pronounced to be set aside on this
    laconic basis. The simple fact is that the complainant never put her
    assailant’s height at anything approximating 6' whereas both police officers
    described the appellant as about, and even well above, 6'. This is a large difference.
    Further, the complainant did not regard her assailant as a big guy, whereas
    that is precisely how Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Pulfer</span> described him.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    there are two important discrepancies in the testimony relating to the clothing
    worn by the assailant and the appellant on the night in question.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    complainant testified that her assailant was wearing a dark <span class=SpellE>coloured</span> <span class=SpellE>hoody</span> or a hooded sweater. Sergeant <span
class=SpellE>Pulfer</span> testified that the suspect was wearing a dark <span
class=SpellE>coloured</span> <span class=SpellE>hoody</span>. However,
    Constable Benjamin testified that the suspect was wearing a <span class=SpellE>hoody</span> and an outer jacket. The trial judge inaccurately described the complainant’s
    testimony as “the hood seemed to be the same <span class=SpellE>colour</span> as the outer sweater or coat”; in fact, the complainant said that the assailant
    wore only a <span class=SpellE>hoody</span>, with no additional outerwear.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition, although perhaps more minor in nature, the complainant said that the
    assailant wore a baseball cap and the suspect was wearing a baseball cap.
    However, the complainant described the cap as dark, while Sergeant <span
class=SpellE>Pulfer</span> testified that the suspect’s cap was “a light kind
    of brown/white” and Constable Benjamin described it as a “beige multi <span
class=SpellE>colour</span>” cap.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge said this about the clothing: “The description Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Carriere</span> did give of the clothing, did pretty well match
    the clothing of the accused when arrested.” With respect, in light of the above
    discrepancies, I do not think this is an accurate conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning
    to context, the trial judge included in his recitation of the facts that
    supported a conviction “the accused was the only pedestrian in the area at 2:03
    a.m.” and “the accused was a short distance from the site of the robbery when
    arrested”. In my view, the fact that the suspect was detained about a half-hour
    after the attack, that he was almost a kilometer away from the site of the
    attack, and that the suspect was on Montreal Road in the City of Ottawa
    (albeit, admittedly, at 2:03 a.m. on a December night) suggest a need for
    caution in linking the assailant at the apartment building at 1:30 a.m. and the
    appellant almost a kilometer away on a major street a half-hour later.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Taken
    together, these problems amount to, in the language of <span class=SpellE><i>Biniaris</i></span>, “a flaw in the
    evaluation of the evidence”. I do not reach this conclusion lightly in a case
    where the trial judge provided full reasons for his decision and where the
    evidence established important similarities between the complainant’s
    description of her assailant and the appellant when he came in contact with the
    police a half-hour later. However, in the end, the discrepancies between the
    assailant and the appellant, especially the substantial one relating to <span
class=GramE>height,</span> and the shift in time (about 30 minutes) and place
    (almost a kilometer) in a large city lead me to the reluctant conclusion that
    the conviction in this case was unreasonable.</span></p>
