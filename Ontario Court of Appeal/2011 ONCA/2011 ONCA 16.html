    the Superior Court of Justice, dated March 23, 2010, dismissing their action against
    the respondents for failure to file their Statement of Claim within the
    six-month limitation period prescribed by s. 7(1) of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 38 (“<i>PAPA</i>”). Section 7(1) of the <i>PAPA</i> has been repealed (<i>Justice Statute Law Amendment Act¸ 2002,</i> S.O. 2002, C. 24, Schedule B, s. 25) but the parties agree that it applies for

    appellant Mark Chimienti was arrested along with several other persons by the
    Windsor Police Services (“WPS”) on March 30, 2000   following a brawl at a tavern
    in Windsor. The charge against Mr. Chimienti was assault causing bodily harm.
    The respondents allege that the arrest was made on the basis of eyewitness
    evidence. The appellants (Mark and his mother, Patricia Chimienti) claim that
    Mr. Chimienti was a victim in the brawl, he cooperated with the investigation,
    there was no evidence to support the WPS allegations against him, and other
    witnesses made exculpatory statements concerning Mr. Chimienti’s involvement.</span></p>

    Chimienti was released on the day of his arrest and was arraigned on April 27,
    2000 on a charge of assault causing bodily harm. After a 17-day preliminary

    appellants issued their Statement of Claim on July 31, 2003. They allege that
    Mr. Chimienti was arrested despite the absence of evidence supporting the
    allegations and that the preliminary inquiry was unnecessarily prolonged “for
    the purpose of using him as a bargaining tool against the other defendants.”
    Their claim against the police officers is framed in terms of negligent and
    malicious investigation.</span></p>

    steps, albeit slowly. Service of the Statement of Claim took place on January
    27, 2004. The WPS group of defendants filed their Statement of Defence on May
    31, 2004. Documents have been exchanged. Discovery of the parties was held in
    December 2007 and January 2008. The parties have agreed to non-party
    examination of two witnesses, which is still pending. The parties agreed to
    transfer the matter from Chatham-Kent to Windsor, which was done in December
    2008. </span></p>

    WPS defendants brought a motion to dismiss the action against them on April 15,
    2009, five years and three months after they had been served with the claim.
    The motion was brought pursuant to rule 21.01(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, and asserted that
    the appellants’ cause of action was outside the six-month limitation period
    prescribed in s. 7(1) of the <i>PAPA</i>.</span></p>
  <h4><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a decision released on March 23, 2010, the motion
    judge held that since the respondents were acting within the scope of their
    duties when they arrested Mr. Chimienti, the six-month limitation period in the <i>PAPA</i> applied. He further determined
    that the cause of action against the respondents arose on the day Mr. Chimienti
    was arrested, March 30, 2000. Accordingly, the Statement of Claim was issued 40
    months after the cause of action arose, well outside the <i>PAPA </i>limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, and in <i>obiter</i>, the motion judge held that even if the cause of action
    arose on January 30, 2003, the date on which the charges against Mr. Chimienti
    were dropped, his claim was still outside (by one day) the six-month period in
    s. 7 of the <i>PAPA.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also ruled against extending the

    might mitigate against the application of the limitation period, nor persuasive
    law in support of that proposition.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect, I do not agree. In <i>Hill v.
    Hamilton Wentworth Police Services Board</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R.129, McLachlin
    C.J.C. discussed the interpretation of s. 7(1) of the <i>PAPA</i> in the context of a claim of negligent investigation. She
    stated, at paras. 96-98:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The
    limitation period for negligent investigation begins to run when the cause of
    action is complete.&nbsp; This requires proof of a duty of care, breach of the
    standard of care, compensable damage, and causation.&nbsp; A cause of action in
    negligence arises not when the negligent act is committed, but rather when the
    harmful consequences of the negligence result.&nbsp; (See G. Mew, <i>The Law of
    Limitations</i> (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 148, citing L. N. Klar et al., <i>Remedies
    in Tort</i> (loose-leaf), ed. by L. D. Rainaldi, vol. 4 (release 5), c. 27, at
    para. 217, n. 23.)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            As
    discussed above, the loss or injury as a result of alleged police negligence is
    not established until it is clear that the suspect has been imprisoned as a
    result of a wrongful conviction or has suffered some other form of compensable
    harm as a result of negligent police conduct.&nbsp; The wrongfulness of the
    conviction is essential to establishing compensable injury in an action where
    the compensable damage to the plaintiff is imprisonment resulting from a
    wrongful conviction.&nbsp; In such a case, the cause of action is not complete
    until the plaintiff can establish that the conviction was in fact
    wrongful.&nbsp; So long as a valid conviction is in place, the plaintiff cannot
    do so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            It
    follows that the limitation period in this case did not start to run until
    December 20, 1999 when Mr. Hill, after a new trial, was acquitted of all
    charges of robbery.&nbsp; The action was commenced by notice of action on June
    19, 2000, within the six-month limitation period set out in the <i>Public
    Authorities Protection Act</i>.&nbsp; Therefore, the relevant limitation period
    was met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this reasoning is directly applicable to
    this appeal. In <i>Hill</i>, the
    “compensable harm” arising from the alleged negligent police conduct consisted
    of the incarceration of Mr. Hill, despite the fact that the police were not
    directly responsible for his incarceration. While the alleged harm in this case
    – the inconvenience, indignity and cost of defending a criminal charge for a 34-month
    period – is different from that in <i>Hill</i>,
    it also is a result flowing directly from the alleged wrongful actions of the
    police. If Mr. Hill’s incarceration was properly considered harm arising from
    police misconduct, I fail to see how Mr. Chimienti’s prosecution could be
    considered too distinct from the police actions to be viewed in the same way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also have some sympathy for the appellants’ policy
    arguments. In my view, it is unrealistic to ask a person already preoccupied
    with defending a criminal charge to take on the additional effort and cost of
    mounting a civil action, particularly given the likely unfounded but
    understandable concern that, in doing so, he might antagonize the police and
    Crown counsel. Furthermore, there is something of a logical inconsistency in
    asking a civil court to rule on the propriety of a criminal prosecution before
    the criminal court has had the opportunity to assess the merits of the underlying
    charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I conclude that the motion judge
    erred by determining that the appellants’ cause of action was complete on the
    date of Mr. Chimienti’s arrest, March 30, 2000. On the contrary, <i>Hill</i> instructs that the cause of action
    was complete on the date that the charge against Mr. Chimienti was dropped,
    January 30, 2003.</p>

    was withdrawn. Accordingly, the specified day in this case was January 30, 2003.
    Rule 2 therefore indicates that July 30, 2003 would be included within the limitation

    required the respondents to obtain leave to bring their motion, they did not do
    so, and, in any event, leave should not have been granted.</span></p>

    law governing the court’s power to relieve against the operation of a
    limitation period changed with the enactment of the new <i>Limitation Act</i>, <i>2002</i>,
    S.O. 2002, c.24, Schedule B. In <i>Joseph v.
    Paramount Canada’s Wonderland</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 401 (C.A.), Feldman J.A.
    held that the new statute eliminated the “special circumstances” doctrine,
    which had previously granted courts the discretion to allow a plaintiff to amend
    a claim by adding parties or causes of action following the expiry of a
    limitation period where no prejudice to the opposing party would result and
    where special circumstances existed justifying the exercise of such discretion.

    interpretation of the new <i>Limitations
    Act,</i> <i>2002</i>, it left open the
    continued operation of the “special circumstances” doctrine in cases governed
    by limitation periods found in statutes other than the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>. This point was expressly made by Feldman
    J.A. in a companion case to <i>Joseph</i> released on the same day, <i>Meady v.
    Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp.</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 774 at para. 24:</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>24(5)
    If the former limitation period did not expire before January 1, 2004 and if a

lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since

    as explained by Feldman J.A. in <i>Joseph</i> at para. 12, the scope of the “special circumstances” doctrine is limited to
    allowing the court “to add or substitute a party or to add a cause of action
    after the expiry of a limitation period where special circumstances exist”. The
    doctrine does not allow the commencement of a new action following the expiry
    of the limitation period. As Feldman J.A. stated at para. 28:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Both
    the common law doctrine from <i>Basarsky v.
    Quinlan</i> and the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> contemplate only the power to amend or add a claim or party to an
    existing action. They did not give the court the authority to allow an action
    to be commenced after the expiry of a limitation period.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For

    their supplementary submissions filed at the direction of the motion judge
    after the motion hearing, the appellants submitted that the motion judge should
    refuse leave. Unfortunately, the motion judge did not address this issue
    although he touched on it tangentially in the final paragraph of his reasons:
    “In view of Rule 21.02 requiring a timely filing of this Motion by the

lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    although the unqualified word “irregularity” in rule 2.02 has the potential to
    apply to statutes other than the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i>, both the wording of the rest of Rule 2 and its title
    suggest otherwise. Rule 2.01(1) provides: “A failure to comply with <i>these rules</i> is an irregularity and does
    not render a proceeding or a step, document or order in a proceeding a nullity…”
    (emphasis added). The title of Rule 2 is “Non-Compliance with the Rules”. This
    wording and title suggest an internal ambit to the operation of Rule 2.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    this interpretation is supported by the authors of <i>Holmested and Watson Ontario Civil Procedure</i> (Garry D. Watson, Q.C.
    and Lynne Jeffrey, looseleaf (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 1993), at 2-4 and 2-5:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    provisions of Rule 2 deal with the subject of non-compliance with the Rules and
    fall into two groups… Rule 2.02 is concerned with non-compliance with the
    Rules, in the sense that it requires an attack on a proceeding for irregularity
    to be made promptly and before a further step is taken by the moving party.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly,
    the authors of <i>Holmested and Gale Ontario
    Judicature Act and Rules of Practice</i> (George Alexander <i>et al</i>., eds., looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell, 1983), in their
    discussion of Rules 186 and 187 of the <i>Rules
    of Practice and Procedure of the Supreme Court of Ontario</i>, R.R.O. 1980, Reg.
    540,  as revoked by <i>Rules of Civil </i>Procedure, O.Reg 560/84 the predecessors to Rule 2
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    stated at 1394:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    principles embodied in RR. 186 and 187 do not apply to the precise and

    does not widen the scope of their application….</span></p>

    I observe that in their recently published text <i>The Law of Civil Procedure in Ontario</i>, Justice Paul Perell and John

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he
    three rules in Rule 2, entitled “Effect of Non-Compliance”… are concerned not
    so much with the meaning of provisions in the <i>Rules</i> but rather <i>how</i> they

    should be applied at all and, more specifically, with the legal consequences of
    non-compliance with the <i>Rules</i>.”

    the case law, albeit limited, supports an interpretation limiting the word
    “irregularity” in Rule 2 to situations involving non-compliance with the <i>Rules</i>: see, for example, <i>Leadbetter v. Darlington</i>, [1949] O.W.N.
    365 (H.C.) and <i>Tummillo v. Prouty</i> (1990), 42 C.P.C. (2d) 308 (Ont. Dist. Ct.).</span></p>
