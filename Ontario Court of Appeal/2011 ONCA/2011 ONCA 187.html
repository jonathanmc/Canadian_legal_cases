  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late October 2007, Jacy Pierre, a 27-year-old First
    Nations person, died of a drug overdose in the Thunder Bay District Jail.  At about the same time, Reggie Bushie, a
    15-year-old First Nations youth, drowned in the McIntyre River near Thunder
    Bay.  Inquests into their deaths were
    ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before each inquest <span class=GramE>began,</span> the
    families of the deceased raised concerns about whether the jury roll from which coroners’ juries are
    selected was representative.  The
    families produced compelling affidavit evidence showing that in the
    neighbouring District of Kenora the jury roll had excluded nearly all First
    Nations persons living on a reserve.  Each family <span lang=EN-US>– </span>and
    on the Bushie inquest, Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN)<span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><a href="#1">[1]</a></span></span>&nbsp; <a name="2"></a><span lang=EN-US>– </span>asked the presiding
    coroner to issue a summons to the Director of Court Operations so they could
    find out how the jury roll in the District of Thunder Bay was established.  Both coroners refused to issue a summons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Pierre family and NAN applied for judicial review
    of each coroner’s decision and a stay of the inquests pending the hearing of
    their applications.  Karakatsanis J.
    refused to stay the Pierre inquest but granted a stay of the Bushie
    inquest.  The Pierre inquest was
    completed in February 2009; the Bushie inquest has yet to be held.  In July 2009, the Divisional Court dismissed
    the applications for judicial review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 2010, leave to appeal was granted.  The appeals raise three issues.  The critical first issue is whether a coroner
    has jurisdiction to inquire into the representativeness of a jury roll.  Assuming a coroner has this jurisdiction, the
    second issue is whether the families of the deceased and NAN have put forward
    sufficient evidence to warrant the issuance of a summons to the Director of
    Court Operations. Assuming a summons is warranted, the final issue is whether
    this court should order a second inquest into the death of Jacy Pierre.</p>

    coroner ordered an inquest into Jacy Pierre’s death under s. 10(4) of the <i>Coroners Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C 37,
    which directs a coroner to hold an inquest whenever a person dies while an
    inmate at a correctional institution.  Elizabeth and Marlene Pierre (the Pierre family) are the mother and
    grandmother of Jacy Pierre.  They were
    granted standing at the inquest under s. 41(1) of the <i>Coroners Act</i>.  </span></p>

    before the inquest started, the Pierre family told the presiding coroner Dr. </span>Shelagh
    McRae that they had concerns and questions about the jury roll in the District
    of Thunder Bay.  They asked for
    information confirming that First Nations individuals living on reserves were
    included on the jury roll.  The coroner’s
    counsel told them to get this information from the Attorney General’s office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Pierre family then wrote to a representative
    of the Attorney General’s office, Robert Gordon, the Director of Court
    Operations for the North West Region.  The family asked Mr. Gordon four questions about the jury roll in
    Thunder Bay:</p>

  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>Instead of
    answering these questions, Mr. Gordon told the Pierre family to “raise any
    questions or concerns about the Coroner’s jury with the Coroner or [her] counsel.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Faced
    with the unwillingness of either the office of the coroner or the Attorney
    General to answer their concerns, the Pierre family asked Dr. McRae to issue a
    summons to Mr. Gordon to attend the inquest before the jury was sworn and speak
    to the validity of the jury roll.  Dr.
    McRae refused to issue a summons.  She said
    that Mr. Gordon’s evidence was not “vital to the purpose of the inquest.”  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Pierre family sought to judicially review Dr. McRae’s refusal to issue a
    summons and a stay of the inquest until their judicial review application was
    decided.  Although the motion judge found
    that the application raised a serious issue, she nonetheless dismissed the
    motion for a stay because the inquest had already begun by the time the motion
    was argued.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    their stay was denied, the Pierre family withdrew from the inquest and did not
    participate further.  They cited as a
    reason for their withdrawal the failure of the coroner to ensure that
    Aboriginal persons would be represented on the jury.  The inquest began on February 23, 2009 and
    was completed on February 25, 2009.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span lang=EN-US>       The inquest into the death of Reggie Bushie</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reggie Bushie was from the remote fly-in community of
    Poplar Hill.  He went to Thunder Bay for
    high school because his own community did not have a high school.  While in Thunder Bay, he lived with a family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 26, 2007, Reggie Bushie went missing.  On November 1, 2007, his body was found in
    the McIntyre River, where he had apparently drowned.  The coroner ordered an inquest into Reggie
    Bushie’s death under s. 20 of the <i>Coroners
    Act</i>, which authorizes the holding of an inquest where doing so “would serve
    the public interest.”  The inquest will
    examine the circumstances surrounding Reggie Bushie’s death and how First
    Nations youths are affected when going to school far away from their home
    communities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rhoda and Berenson King (the King family) are the
    mother and step-father of Reggie Bushie.  In December 2008, they wrote to the coroner’s counsel and questioned whether
    the <i>Juries Act</i>, <span lang=EN-US>R.S.O. 1990, c. J.3</span> had been complied
    with.  The coroner’s counsel replied,
    expressing her belief that the practices in the District of Thunder Bay
    complied with the <i>Juries Act</i>, and her
    confidence that the inquest jury would be representative and impartial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early January 2009, the King family asked the
    coroner’s counsel to clarify the basis of her belief.  The response was that the coroner’s counsel
    had obtained information about the jury roll from Mr. Gordon.  The King family was told to contact Mr.
    Gordon directly for any further information about “compliance issues.”  They did so, but Mr. Gordon refused to
    provide any further information without a summons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The King family, supported by NAN, then brought a
    motion asking the coroner, Dr. David Eden, to issue a summons for Mr.
    Gordon.  They wanted Mr. Gordon to testify
    about the preparation of the jury roll.  In support of their motion, they filed an affidavit from a supervisor of
    court operations for the Ministry of the Attorney General in the district of
    Kenora.  The affidavit showed that the
    2008 district of Kenora jury roll was unrepresentative because it had almost
    wholly excluded First Nations persons living on reserves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite this evidence, Dr. Eden denied the motion, and
    refused to issue a summons.  In his
    ruling, he held that the King family and NAN had not established a reasonably
    held concern about the representativeness and impartiality of the jury.  He also said, “I do not believe that a jury
    roll from another judicial district at another time is adequately probative to
    impugn the 2009 Thunder Bay jury roll.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NAN applied for judicial review of Dr. Eden’s refusal
    to issue a summons to Mr. Gordon and for a stay pending the determination of
    its application.  On May 29, 2009
    Karakatsanis J. ordered a stay of the inquest proceedings.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The
    decision of the Divisional Court</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court unanimously held that neither
    coroner erred in refusing to issue a summons to Mr. Gordon.  The court gave three reasons:  first, the coroner “had no statutory power to
    review the process for the selection of the jury roll”; second, “the coroner
    would have had no authority to remedy any problems with the jury roll, should
    they be present”; and third, each coroner’s decision that the evidence
    submitted by the applicants was insufficient to warrant further inquiry was

    coroner’s inquest has two functions:  a
    narrow investigative function and a broader public interest function.  The inquest’s investigative function is to
    inquire into the circumstances of the death, including answering the five questions
    set out in s. 31(1) of the <i>Coroners Act</i> – who the deceased was, and how, when, where and by what means the deceased
    came to his or her death.  The inquest’s
    public interest function, which is found in s. 31(3) of the Act, is to make
    recommendations directed at avoiding a death in similar circumstances or on any
    matter arising out of the inquest.</span></p>

    an inquest jury cannot make findings of legal responsibility, recent case law
    has emphasized the importance of the inquest’s public interest function in
    exposing systemic failings that cause death.  In <i>People First of Ontario v.
    Porter, Regional Coroner Niagara</i> (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 609 (Div. Ct.),
    reversed on other grounds (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 289 (C.A.), the Divisional Court
    wrote about this public interest function:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A
    separate and wider function is becoming increasingly significant; the
    vindication of the public interest in the prevention of death by the public
    exposure of conditions that threaten life.  The separate role of the jury in recommending systemic changes to
    prevent death has become more and more important.  The social and preventive function of the
    inquest which focuses on the public interest has become, in some cases, just as
    important as the distinctly separate function of investigating the individual
    facts of individual deaths and the personal roles of individuals involved in
    the death.</span></p>

    function properly, a jury must have two key characteristics:  representativeness and impartiality.  A representative jury is one that corresponds,
    as much as possible, to a cross-section of the larger community.  And a representative jury enhances the
    impartiality of a jury.  In <i>R. v. Gayle</i> (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 36
    (C.A.) at para. 56, Sharpe J.A. discussed the importance of a representative
    jury:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>C<span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>anadian law recognizes the importance of a

    described a “representative jury pool” as one of the safeguards included in the

    course, a party with standing at an inquest has no right to insist on a juror that
    is “representative” of a particular racial, ethnic or linguistic group.  Nonetheless, representativeness in the
    preparation of a jury roll is important, not only for ensuring a properly
    constituted jury, but also for maintaining the public’s confidence in a
    coroner’s inquest and preserving its integrity.  A coroner’s power to inquire into the impartiality of an individual
    juror – a power the coroner undoubtedly possesses – cannot remedy the
    unrepresentativeness of a roll from which the jurors are chosen.  The representativeness of a jury roll depends
    on compliance with the <i>Juries Act</i>,
    and in the present case, on compliance with s. 6(8) of that Act.</span></p>

    is the principal issue on these appeals.  The Divisional Court concluded that a coroner has no jurisdiction to
    inquire into how a jury roll is established and, even if a coroner does have
    this jurisdiction, coroners are powerless to grant a remedy for an
    unrepresentative jury roll.  The Attorney
    General supports the Divisional Court’s conclusions and <span class=GramE>adds</span> a third prong to its argument:  both s.
    36 of the <i>Coroners Act</i> and s. 44 of
    the <i>Juries Act</i> “cure” any failure to

    do not accept the Attorney General’s position.  Admittedly, a coroner’s jurisdiction is derived from the <i>Coroners Act</i> and the common law rules of
    natural justice.  And while both s. 34(6)
    of the Act and the rules of natural justice give the coroner jurisdiction to
    exclude a potential juror for partiality, there is no express statutory or

    implication.  A statutory tribunal, such

    the coroner could say that the list has not been taken from a jury roll that
    complies with s. 6(8) and could order the sheriff to produce a list of jurors
    from a proper jury roll.  At least to
    that extent, a remedy is available to rectify an unrepresentative jury roll.</span></p>

    No omission to observe the directions contained in any Act with respect to the
    qualification, selection, balloting or distribution of jurors, the preparation

    to the majority in <i>Barrow</i>, at paras.
    37-38, “[t]he import of these two provisions is that an irregularity of form
    which does not affect the substance of a trial cannot be used to challenge the
    result”.  In the case before the court,
    these provisions were of no assistance and did not apply because the omission complained
    of was “not an irregularity of form. It [cast] into doubt two of the most basic
    aspects of a fair trial, the impartiality of the jury and the appearance of
    justice.”</span></p>

    in this case, an unrepresentative jury is not an “irregularity of form” it is a
    matter of “substance”.  An
    unrepresentative jury roll casts into doubt the public’s confidence in the
    impartiality of the jury and the fairness of the inquest.  It compromises the very appearance of
    justice.  The words of Dickson C.J.C. in <i>Barrow</i>, at para. 33, are apt:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    argument of the Crown in this appeal does not address what may be the most
    important aspect of the case, namely, the appearance of justice.  Even if the two-stage analysis of the

    effect of the proceedings in this case as they would appear to the average
    citizen …</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>Consistent
    with <i>Barrow</i>, neither s. 36 of the <i>Coroners Act</i> nor s. 44 of the <i>Juries Act</i> can cure a list drawn from a

    add that, historically, curative provisions such as the ones considered by the
    court in <i>Barrow</i> have been construed
    narrowly: see e.g. <i>R. v. Butler</i> (1984), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 243 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 261; <i>R. v. Varga </i>(1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 281 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 287-288
    and <i>R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C.
    (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 33. This court has also construed s. 44(1) of the <i>Juries Act</i> narrowly: <i>Hrup v. Cipollone</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d)
    715 (C.A.), at pp. 718-719. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
    s. 36 of the <i>Coroners Act</i> and s. 44
    of the <i>Juries Act</i> must be interpreted
    to apply only to technical or procedural irregularities in “the eligibility and
    selection of jurors”, “the preparation of the jury roll” and “the drafting of
    panels from the jury roll”, and not to a requirement as fundamental as the
    representativeness of an inquest jury.  I
    conclude that the coroner has the jurisdiction to inquire into the representativeness
    of the jury roll and to remedy a list drawn from an unrepresentative roll.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Second Issue: Have the appellants put forward
    sufficient evidence to warrant the issuance of a summons?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    40(1) of the <i>Coroners Act</i> give a
    coroner authority to issue a summons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A coroner may require any person by summons,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)
          <span class=GramE>to</span> give
    evidence on oath or affirmation at an inquest; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)
          <span class=GramE>to</span> produce
    in evidence at an inquest documents and things specified by the coroner,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>relevant</span> to the
    subject-matter of the inquest and admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To obtain an order requiring each coroner to issue a
    summons to Mr. Gordon, the appellants must show two things:  first, a nexus between the expected evidence
    of Mr. Gordon and the purpose of the inquest:  see <i>Reid v. Wigle </i>(1980), 29
    O.R. (2d) 633 (Div. Ct.); and second, sufficient evidence to justify a further
    inquiry into the alleged lack of representativeness of the jury roll in the
    District of Thunder Bay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants meet the first requirement.  The Attorney General accepts that Mr. Gordon was
    the most knowledgeable person within the Ministry to testify about the
    establishment of the jury roll in the District of Thunder Bay.  Moreover, on my view of the coroner’s
    jurisdiction, an inquiry into the representativeness of the jury roll is
    relevant to the purpose of the inquest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the inquest – to examine the
    circumstances of the death and make recommendations to avoid similar deaths in
    the future – cannot be satisfied with a jury selected from a jury roll that was
    not established in accordance with the requirements of the <i>Juries Act</i>.  With an
    unrepresentative jury roll, the inquest jury cannot be seen to represent – as
    far as possible and appropriate – the larger community, and its impartiality is
    undermined.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, without the two characteristics of
    representativeness and the impartiality, a jury cannot perform, in an
    acceptable way, the functions that make  juries desirable in the first place:  see <i>R.
    v. Sherratt</i> [1991], 1 S.C.R. 509 at 525.  The appellants have thus shown a nexus between the evidence of Mr.
    Gordon and the purpose of the inquest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The important question on this branch of the appeals is
    whether the appellants have met the second requirement.  Have they put forward sufficient evidence to
    justify an inquiry into the representativeness of the jury roll?  Each coroner found that the families of the deceased
    and NAN had not put forward adequate evidence.  The Divisional Court held that their findings were entitled to
    deference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the coroners’ findings are entitled to
    deference.  If those findings were
    reasonable, I would not interfere with them.  However, respectfully, I consider each finding to be unreasonable.  In saying that, I do not think it is
    necessary to specify the evidentiary threshold needed to justify a further
    inquiry.  Even if strong evidence were
    needed, as I view the record, the appellants have put forward a strong case for
    further inquiry into the representativeness of the jury roll in the District of
    Thunder Bay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ case consists principally of three
    items of evidence:  the decision of the
    Federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC), taken a decade ago,
    to cease providing band electoral lists to the Provincial Jury Centre; the
    state of the jury roll in the District of Kenora in the aftermath of INAC’s
    decision; and the unwillingness of either Mr. Gordon or coroners’ counsel to be
    forthcoming about whether First Nations persons living on reserves were
    included on the jury roll from which the inquest juries were to be chosen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Up until 2000, INAC provided the names of First Nations
    persons living on reserves by sending band electoral lists to the Provincial Jury
    Centre.  The Centre is responsible for
    sending jury questionnaires to all Ontario residents, including First Nations
    persons.  Thus, the band electoral lists played
    a central role in ensuring that First Nations persons on reserves were included
    in the County or District jury rolls.  They enabled sheriffs to fulfill their statutory obligation under s.
    6(8) of the <i>Juries Act</i> to “select
    names of eligible persons inhabiting the reserve in the same manner as if the
    reserve were a municipality.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2000, however, INAC stopped sending these band
    electoral lists to the Centre.  The
    material before us does not disclose why the federal department stopped this
    practice.  Whatever the reason, without
    these lists, the Centre did not have an accurate, up-to-date record of the
    names of on-reserve First Nations persons.  Therefore, to meet their obligation under s. 6(8) of the <i>Juries Act</i> to create representative jury
    rolls that included First Nations persons, court officials had to find the
    names of persons on reserves form other available records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The families of Jacy Pierre and Reggie Bushie together
    with NAN expressed to the coroners their concerns that court officials had not sought
    other available records to ensure a representative jury roll.  Their concerns were entirely reasonable in
    the light of what had happened in the neighbouring District of Kenora.  There, in 2006, a First Nations person from the
    Kashechewan community died and an inquest was ordered into his death.  Rolanda Peacock, Mr. Gordon’s counterpart in
    the District of Kenora, filed an affidavit in connection with that inquest.  Her affidavit is included in the record for
    the two appeals before us.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Peacock’s affidavit shows that court officials did
    very little to obtain other records and, as a result, the District of Kenora
    jury roll was manifestly unrepresentative.  Her affidavit documents the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As INAC no longer supplied up to date band
    electoral lists, court officials tried to obtain band lists directly from First
    Nations reserves within the district.  In
    August 2006, they faxed a letter to the chiefs of 42 of the 45 First Nations
    communities in the District of Kenora, requesting up to date band lists.  Only four of the 42 communities
    responded.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2007, court officials traveled to 14 remote
    First Nations communities in the District of Kenora.  Their efforts produced only eight more band
    electoral lists.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2006 and 2007 the District of Kenora jury
    roll was based on jury questionnaires sent to 1,200 persons living in
    municipalities and 484 First Nations persons living on reserves.  The rate of return from persons living in
    municipalities was 66 per cent in 2006 and 56 per cent in 2007.  The corresponding rate of return from First
    Nations persons on reserves was 10.72 per cent and 7.83 per cent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of a population of over 12,000 First Nations
    persons living on reserves in the District of Kenora, only 44 were listed on
    the 2007 jury roll.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the inquest concerned the death of a
    First Nations person from Kashechewan, not a single person from that community
    was included on the District of Kenora jury roll.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Peacock’s affidavit shows that much more needed to
    be done to produce a representative jury roll in the District of Kenora.  The annual roll in the years after INAC
    stopped sending band electoral lists to the Provincial Jury Centre almost
    entirely excluded First Nations persons living on reserves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, Dr. Eden took the position that what
    occurred in the District of Kenora was not “adequately probative” of the
    representativeness of the jury roll in the District of Thunder Bay.  I cannot agree with his assessment.  Nor do I find reassuring the bald assertion
    of the coroner’s counsel in the Bushie inquest that the practices in the
    District of Thunder Bay complied with the <i>Juries
    Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no reason to think that the
    unrepresentativeness of the jury roll in the District of Kenora is unique.  After 2000, the Provincial Jury Centre no
    longer received band electoral lists for the reserves in the District of
    Thunder Bay.  No evidence was produced in
    connection with either inquest that court officials in the District of Thunder
    Bay had made any greater efforts than their counterparts in the District of
    Kenora to obtain up-to-date band lists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My concern about the representativeness of the jury
    roll in the District of Thunder Bay is fuelled by the unwillingness of either
    the coroners or Mr. Gordon to be forthcoming about how the roll was
    established.  The Pierre family and the
    King family requested information about the records used to obtain the names of
    First Nations persons on reserves, the number of jury questionnaire sent to
    on-reserve residents, and the number of First Nations persons on the jury roll
    from which inquest jurors are chosen (see for example the letter reproduced at
    para. 8 of these reasons).  Their request
    for this information was quite reasonable.  But they did not get any answers.  Instead, they got the run around.  A lot of time and money might have been saved had the Ministry and the
    coroners simply provided this information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INAC’s decision to stop sending band electoral lists to
    the Provincial Jury Centre, the unrepresentativeness of the recent jury rolls
    in the District of Kenora and the unwillingness of Mr. Gordon and the coroners
    to provide information about the jury roll in the District of Thunder Bay make
    out a strong case for summonsing Mr. Gordon.  I would order that a summons be issued to him (or the current occupant
    of his position) to appear at the Bushie inquest and testify about the
    establishment of the jury roll in the District of Thunder Bay, and especially
    about the efforts to comply with s. 6(8) of the <i>Juries Act</i>, as well as the result of those efforts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As will be evident, since I would order a new inquest
    into the death of Jacy Pierre, I would also order Mr. Gordon (or his successor)
    to appear before that inquest and similarly testify about the establishment of
    the jury roll in the District of Thunder Bay.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Third Issue:  Should this court order a second inquest into the death of Jacy Pierre?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would order a new inquest into the death of Jacy
    Pierre.  I would do so for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, although Karakatsanis J. denied a stay of the
    inquest, she noted at para. 21 of her reasons, that “[i]f the application for
    judicial review is successful, a new Inquest may be held.”  Indeed, she found that counsel for the Pierre
    family “was diligent in pursuing her concerns relating to whether the jury roll
    was representative of the community that includes First Nations”.  Only the “tight timeframes” prevented that
    concern from being resolved before the Jacy Pierre inquest began.  Otherwise, undoubtedly, Karakatsanis J. would
    have stayed this inquest as she did the Reggie Bushie inquest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, a new inquest is needed to restore the public’s
    confidence in the inquiry into the circumstances of Jacy Pierre’s death.  The first inquest was marred by the
    legitimate concern about the unrepresentativeness of the jury roll and the
    consequent withdrawal of the Pierre family.  The First Nations community, and by extension the public, could have
    little confidence in the impartiality of the jury at that inquest.  Those memorable, even if well-worn, words
    apply here; justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.  A new inquest, where the alleged lack of representativeness
    of the jury roll may be fairly considered, is thus necessary.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A coroner has jurisdiction by necessary implication to
