    charged with criminal negligence causing death while street racing contrary to
    s. 249.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Late on the evening of Monday, September 29,
    2008, three young men engaged in a car race on a street in Mississauga.  One of the drivers lost control of his car,
    collided with a lamp post and was killed.  The two surviving drivers were charged under s. 249.2 with criminal
    negligence causing death while street racing.  </span></p>

    abetted the drivers engaging in the race, and was therefore a party to the

    2008, the respondent, aged sixteen, and several other young persons were
    socializing at a pub in Mississauga.  Some of them began discussing whose car was the fastest and who <span
class=GramE>was the best driver</span>.  A conversation developed about street racing.  The group, including the respondent, then went
    to Argentia Road in order to have a street race.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The group chose a long, wide,
    well-lit, relatively straight stretch of road in the area of an industrial park
    with little traffic.  Three vehicles
    lined up across the road, with one in the oncoming lane.  The respondent was asked to drop his red
    jacket to start the race.  He was
    reluctant at first, but eventually agreed.  He urged the drivers to “keep things safe”.  He then started the race by dropping his
    jacket.</span></p>

    driver of the car in the oncoming lane dropped back and drove behind the other
    two in the proper lane.  When one of the
    two leading cars reached a slight bend in the road, the driver lost control,
    hit a light standard and was killed.  The
    other two cars were not directly involved in the accident.</span></p>

    videotaped statement to the police.  He admitted
    that he knew there was going to be a race and that he dropped his jacket in
    order to signal the start. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An accident reconstruction

    the car that crashed was travelling at a minimum of 95</span> kilometres<span lang=EN-US> an hour
    immediately before reaching the curve in the road where the accident
    occurred.  The expert’s opinion was that
    the driver should have been able to negotiate the curve travelling at that
    speed. </span></p>
  <h3>The Decision Below</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge allowed the
    respondent’s motion for a directed verdict and acquitted him.  The trial judge gave brief oral reasons for
    his decision.  He accepted that the
    respondent dropped his jacket in order to start the race.  He said that if the two surviving drivers in
    the race were before him, he would hold them responsible because they had
    participated in the race.</span></p>

    that the only issue to be determined was whether the respondent’s participation
    by dropping his jacket to start the race was “sufficient” to categorize it as
    leading to and causing death. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that
    dropping the jacket was not sufficient to constitute the offence of criminal
    negligence causing death.  He concluded that
    it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute if he found that “a
    man who dropped the jacket at the request of one of the racers to start the
    race [was] a participant”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his reasons, the trial judge
    did not specifically mention s. 21 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, nor did he directly comment on the Crown’s theory that the respondent
    was liable as an</span> aider<span
lang=EN-US> or abettor to the offence charged.  </span></p>
  <h3>Issues</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are two issues:  </span></p>

    Code</i>?  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>If the answer to the first issue is “Yes”, what disposition should
    this court make?</span></p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <h3>1. The trial judge’s reasons – s. 21(1) </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown argues that the trial
    judge failed to consider or to properly apply the aiding and abetting
    provisions under s. 21 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> when assessing the respondent’s criminal liability.  I agree.  In both its submissions to the trial judge and in argument in this
    court, the Crown’s theory of liability rested solely on the application of s.
    21(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) or (c) to the respondent’s conduct in
    starting the race.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 21 reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Every one is a party to an offence who</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>actually
    commits it;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>does
    or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span
class=GramE>abets</span> any person in committing it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s strongest argument
    under s. 21 is based on s. 21(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) – aiding the
    commission of an offence.  There is no
    evidence to suggest that the respondent did anything to encourage the street
    race other than drop his jacket.  Thus,
    if it is found that the respondent’s conduct did not constitute “aiding” the
    participants in the race, there would be no basis to find that the conduct
    abetted those persons.  As such, I will
    limit my discussion to s. 21(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b).</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown argues that there was
    evidence on which the two surviving drivers involved in the street race could
    be convicted of criminal negligence causing death.  The respondent provided assistance to them by
    dropping his jacket, thereby starting the race.  The Crown also argues that the respondent had the intent required to
    establish liability under s. 21(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) because he
    dropped his jacket “for the purpose” of assisting the drivers’ criminally

    and criminal negligence causing death have much in common.  Importantly, for present purposes, both
    involve a dangerous or unlawful act that causes death.  From both a logical and policy standpoint, it

    offence of criminal negligence causing death.  As I pointed out above, the offence of unlawful act manslaughter is similar
    to the offence of criminal negligence causing death, and with respect to the

    doing (or in some circumstances, omitting to do) something that assists the
    perpetrator to commit the offence.  I am
    satisfied that the respondent, by dropping his jacket, committed an act that
    assisted the drivers of the cars to participate in a street race.  </span></p>

    context of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence of the street race in
    this case was evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find the drivers’
    actions to be criminally negligent.  Street
    races, as unregulated races on public roadways, are illegal.  They are inherently dangerous and will, in
    many cases, amount to a marked and substantial departure from what is
    reasonable in the circumstances.    </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By their nature, street races
    involve a competition between drivers to see who can drive the fastest.  As a race progresses, the spur of competition
    can lead the racers to drive at higher and higher speeds and to take even more
    dangerous risks than they may have initially considered.  To be involved in a street race at all exhibits,
    at best, very bad judgment.  That bad
    judgment can only be exacerbated as events unfold.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The dangers to members of the
    public are obvious.  Street racers
    threaten the lives and safety of other drivers as well as people in the
    vicinity of the race.  The potential for
    injury and suffering by innocent members of the public is enormous.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I recognize that there are
    cases where courts have found that street racing did not constitute the very
    serious offence of criminal negligence causing death.  See for example, <i>R. v. Lipovetzky</i> (2007), 57 M.V.R. (5th) 130 (Ont. S.C.); <i>R. v. M.D.</i>, 2005 ONCJ 141; <i>R. v. Menezes</i> (2002), 50 C.R. (5th) 343
    (Ont. S.C.).  In these cases, the accused
    were convicted of the included offence of dangerous driving.  However, these cases were decided following a
    full trial and were based on the conclusion that it had not been established
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s conduct amounted to a marked and
    substantial departure from the norm.  In
    contrast, the test to meet at this juncture of the appeal is concerned only
    with the sufficiency of evidence on a motion for directed verdict.          </span></p>

    evidence that the respondent intended to assist the street race and that he
    knew the details of how the race would take place.  It would be open to a court to conclude that
    the race, as the respondent anticipated it, was a marked and substantial
    departure from what was reasonable in the circumstances.</span></p>
