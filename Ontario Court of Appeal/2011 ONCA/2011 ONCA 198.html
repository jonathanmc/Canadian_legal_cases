  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three motions for leave to intervene were brought in
    this appeal. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (the “UNHCR”),
    the Canadian Council for Refugees (the “CCR”) and the Canadian Civil Liberties
    Association (the “CCLA”) have all brought motions to intervene as friends of
    the court.  The motions were heard
    together.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>The Underlying Appeal</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The underlying appeal is </span>of an order of Justice Czutrin of the
    Superior Court of Justice, in which he granted an application under the <i>Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of
    International Child Abduction </i>(the<i> “Hague Convention”</i>) to have a then thirteen year old girl returned to her
    purported habitual residence with her mother in Mexico.  The parties to the appeal are the girl’s
    parents.  The applicant and respondent on
    appeal is the girl’s mother (the “mother”).  The respondent and appellant on appeal is the
    girl’s father (the “father”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Justice Czutrin’s order the child was
    returned to Mexico where she is currently living.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the Superior Court hearing, the child
    was a Convention refugee living in Canada.  She did not testify at the Superior Court hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal raises questions about the proper
    relationship between the <i>Hague Convention,</i> which is incorporated into Ontario’s <i>Children’s
    Law Reform Act, </i>and the federal <i>Immigration</i> <i>and</i> <i>Refugee Protection Act</i>, which incorporates provisions of
    international law that prohibit the <i>refoulement</i> of refugees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, constitutional issues have been raised on
    appeal.  The father, on appeal, has
    asserted that his section 7 rights under the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> have been contravened because he did
    not receive adequate notice of the Superior Court application. He further
    asserts that his daughter’s section 7 and section 12 rights under the <i>Charter </i>have been contravened<i> </i>because her liberty and security
    interests were affected without giving her notice or an opportunity to be
    heard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two pending motions in this appeal scheduled
    for March 30, 2011. The appeal itself is scheduled to be heard on April 13,
    2011.  The mother has brought a motion to
    quash the appeal as an abuse of process.  The father has brought a motion to have the Office
    of the Children’s Lawyer assign counsel to represent the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General of Ontario has also exercised his
    right to intervene in this matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>Request for Adjournment </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother’s first position is that the motions to
    intervene should themselves be adjourned.  Her counsel asserts that the dates for these
    motions to intervene should be set by the panel for a date to occur sometime
    after the March 30 motion to quash is heard and determined.  Counsel for the mother asserts that the mother
    is indigent and that his firm is working <i>pro
    bono</i> on this case. He asserts that he should not be required to devote
    considerable resources to respond to three motions to intervene, and then
    potentially three intervener factums, until after his motion to quash is heard
    and it is determined that the appeal is going to proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not prepared to adjourn this motion. The appeal is
    scheduled to be heard on April 13, 2011. Both parties recognize the importance
    of dealing with this matter expeditiously and in oral argument both asserted
    that the hearing should proceed on the scheduled day. There would not be enough
    time between March 30 and April 13 for these motions to intervene to be heard
    and determined, for the interveners to file their factums, and for the parties
    to reply to these factums if necessary.  Despite
    counsel for the mother’s submission in oral argument that he thought the appeal
    hearing should continue to go ahead on April 13, 2011, his submissions in his factum
    were that the hearing of the appeal should also be adjourned to a date to be
    set by the panel. Realistically, this would be the necessary consequence of
    delaying these motions.  I am not prepared
    to cause such a delay in a case of this nature. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>The Test for Intervention</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dubin C.J.O. is frequently cited as succinctly
    articulating the test for determining a motion to intervene in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) </i>v. <i>Great Atlantic and Pacific Co. of Canada </i>(1990),
    74 O.R. (2d) 164:  “<span
class=apple-style-span><span style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>[T]he matters to be considered are the nature of the case, the
    issues which arise and the likelihood of the applicant being able to make a
    useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing injustice
    to the immediate parties.”</span></span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>The Proposed Interveners</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The UNHCR was established in 1950 and is entrusted with
    the mandate to provide international protection to refugees and, together with
    governments, to seek solutions to the problem of refugees.  One of its roles under its enacting statute
    is “supervising [the] application” of international conventions for the
    protection of refugees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the UNHCR asserts that it only selectively
    intervenes in domestic cases, but that the interaction between the <i>Hague Convention </i>and the principle of <i>non-refoulement </i>raised in this case is
    of high importance and has not previously been addressed by an appellate level
    court.  Given the unique role and expertise
    of the UNHCR in addressing refugee related matters, I am content that it can
    make a useful contribution to the consideration of the issues raised in this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CCR is a national, non-profit organization founded
    in 1978.  It is an umbrella organization
    comprising approximately 170 member agencies that work with and on behalf of
    refugees and immigrants in Canada.  Its
    mandate is to promote, protect and advance the rights of refugees and
    immigrants in Canada.  It asserts that it
    has intervened in every major refugee case in Canada over the last 20 years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is likely some overlap between the expertise of
    the CCR and the UNHCR, but given that the CCR represents Canadian organizations
    that advocate for refugees in Canada, I am satisfied that its perspective is
    different than that of the UNHCR and that they both can make useful
    contributions in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CCLA’s mandate is to promote and protect
    fundamental rights and liberties. The CCLA has been granted intervener or party
    status in many cases relating to civil liberties. They cite 139 such cases in
    an exhibit to their factum.  Its work
    includes advocacy and education concerning human rights in the immigration
    context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the mother asserts that section 7 was not
    raised at the application stage and that an insufficient factual record has
    been established to argue constitutional issues. The fact is, however, that the
    father has raised section 7 and asserts that there is an adequate record to
    address these issues.  The question of
    whether section 7 should or should not be considered in this matter is better
    left for the panel hearing the appeal to decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CCLA has an established interest and expertise in
    matters relating to civil liberties.  I
    am satisfied that the CCLA can make a useful contribution in speaking to the
    section 7 issues that are raised in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>Will injustice be caused to the parties?</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the mother opposes all the motions to
    intervene, but has not asserted any arguments that demonstrate that their presence
    will cause injustice.  Conditions can be
    placed on the interveners’ participation such that their submissions are
    limited to their areas of expertise and their submissions are contained.  Furthermore, a timeline can be established such
    that any response the mother may want to make to the factums of the interveners
    would not be due until after the motion to quash has been heard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this is a private dispute between two parents
    regarding their daughter, it raises public interest issues that have widespread
    domestic and international importance. In such cases it is appropriate to allow
    public interest interveners, who can make a useful contribution, to be
    permitted to intervene unless their presence causes an injustice:  <i>Childs</i> v<i>. Desormeaux</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d)
    385.  I do not see how the presence of
    the proposed interveners would cause an injustice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I grant the motions for leave to intervene,
    subject to the following conditions, which apply to all interveners, including
    the Attorney General. </p>
