  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a Crown appeal against sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent sexually abused his three
    step-granddaughters over an eight-year period, from 2001 to 2009, when the
    sisters were under the care of the respondent while visiting their grandparents
    on occasional weekends. With each victim, the sexual abuse began with touching
    over clothes and progressed to more intrusive sexual assaults. At the time of
    the abuse, the girls were between the ages of 10 to 12, 7 to 14 and 9 to 14
    years, respectively. The respondents acts included touching and fondling their
    breast and vaginal areas; performing oral sex on one victim; having two of the
    victims watch pornographic movies or magazines while he masturbated; and having
    one of the victims masturbate him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge sentenced the respondent to eight
    months imprisonment consecutive on each count for a total sentence of two years
    imprisonment, to be followed by three years probation. The Crown submits that
    he erred in principle and that the sentence was manifestly unfit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge acknowledged that the principles
    of deterrence and denunciation were paramount when a step-grandfather abuses
    his position of trust. He stated that a sentence of two years less a day would
    not adequately reflect the principle of denunciation. He considered that the
    appropriate sentence was three years, plus three years probation. However, he
    imposed the sentence of two years imprisonment so that he could also impose a
    period of probation with terms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. D.D</i>.
    (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788 (C.A.), at para. 44, Moldaver J.A. stated that as a
    general rule, when adult offenders, in a position of trust, sexually abuse
    innocent young children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial
    periods of time, they can expect to receive mid to upper single digit
    penitentiary terms.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the sentencing judge cited these principles, the
    sentence he imposed failed to adequately reflect the principles of deterrence
    and denunciation, represents a marked departure from the case law, and was
    manifestly unfit in this context of multiple victims. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking all the circumstances of this case, including
    the trial judges acceptance of the significance of the respondents early plea
    and acceptance of responsibility, we allow the appeal and substitute a global
    sentence of four years imprisonment. Apart from the probation order, the other
    orders of the judge remain in force.</p>
