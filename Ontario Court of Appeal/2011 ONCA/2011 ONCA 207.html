  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with two counts of robbery
    and four counts of breach of recognizance as well as failing to comply with a probation
    order.  He was 16 years old at the time
    of the alleged offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was a 22 year old with an intellectual
    disability and, according to the <span class=GramE>complainant,</span> the
    appellant had bullied and robbed him in the past.  After a <i>voir
    dire</i> at which the complainant’s mother and a police officer testified, the
    complainant was allowed to testify from behind a screen because he was fearful
    of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of one count of robbery and
    of the breach and fail to comply charges.  He was sentenced under the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act</i> to five months, two-thirds in secure custody and one
    third under community supervision, plus two years probation.  This was in addition to receiving credit for
    99 days of pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals both conviction and
    sentence.  He argues that the trial judge
    erred by misapplying the reasonable doubt standard, by failing to give
    sufficient reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence and by using evidence
    adduced during the <i>voir dire</i> in
    reaching his decision on the trial proper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to sentence, the appellant submits that
    the sentence imposed was manifestly unfit as the trial judge did not adequately
    consider whether a less severe alternative to the five months sentence was
    appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the third ground raised on the conviction
    appeal is dispositive.  We agree with the
    appellant that the trial judge ought not to have referred to the <i>voir dire</i> evidence in his reasons for
    judgment.  Although the trial judge said
    that his use of the evidence would be narrowly circumscribed and would be for
    the limited <span class=GramE>purpose of helping him understand</span> the
    victim’s demeanour in light of his intellectual disability, this use was
    improper. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that the trial judge’s limited use of
    the <i>voir dire</i> evidence caused no
    prejudice because, reading the record as a whole, it is apparent that the trial
    judge was able to make substantially the same observation concerning the
    complainant based on the complainant’s trial evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  As
    an example of the improper use that causes us concern, we note that, after
    reciting much of the mother’s evidence led at the <i>voir dire</i>, including the mother’s testimony as to an alleged
    statement made by the appellant, the trial judge stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We have to look at this
    particular statement only for one purpose; to see how the statements made by
    the victim to the mother correspond with the statements made in court, and that
    is not for their accuracy, but to see the thinking pattern of the victim
    himself who has certain learning disabilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On our reading of the trial judge’s reasons, it appears
    that he used the <i>voir dire</i> evidence
    to bolster his assessment of the complainant’s credibility.  That assessment is at the root of his
    decision and therefore, the appeal must be allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, the convictions are set aside and a new
    trial is ordered.</p>
