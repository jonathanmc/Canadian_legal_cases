  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from convictions for two counts
    of sexual assault involving two different complainants, S.P. and J.P. The
    appellant was tried by Ramsay J., sitting alone. The trial judge dismissed a
    charge of assault causing bodily harm involving J.P.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

    Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</span>In
    December 2005, the appellant was a 50 year-old licensed social worker working in
    an adolescent mental health unit at the Grand River Hospital. The complainant,
    S.P. was an 18 year-old patient. She was admitted to the unit for anxiety,
    depression, taking overdoses, cutting herself and issues involving prior
    experience of sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</span>The
    appellant was assigned as S.P.s social worker but developed a romantic and
    then sexual relationship with her.  While
    the appellant maintained that the sexual relationship was consensual, the Crown
    asserted that any consent that was given was vitiated under s. 265(3)(d) or s.
    273.1(2)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</span>The
    trial judge concluded that consent was vitiated under s. 273.1(2)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He found that the appellant was in a position
    of trust, that he abused that trust, and that the complainant was induced to
    engage in sexual activity by the appellants abuse of trust. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</span>The
    appellant raises three issues on his appeal against the conviction relating to
    S.P.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge erred by failed to turn his mind to S.Ps subjective state of mind in
    relation to consent and, if he did, his finding on that issue was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The trial judge turned his mind specifically to the question of whether
    the complainant was induced to engage in sexual activity by the appellants
    abuse of his position.  Relying on
    several aspects of the evidence adduced at trial, including the evidence of an
    expert who testified about the nature of a therapist-patient relationship, the
    trial judge concluded that the complainant was in fact induced by the appellants
    abuse of his position as her therapist. In our view, this finding was amply
    supported by the evidence, including evidence concerning how the relationship
    progressed and the complainants own testimony about the appellant and the
    nature of their relationship. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant claims that the trial
    judge erred in relying on the evidence that S.P.s parents trusted the
    appellant and that he deceived them as constituting evidence that the appellant
    induced the complainant to engage in sexual activity by abusing his
    position.  We do not accept this
    submission. The trial judge referred to the appellant deceiving the complainants
    parents as evidence of the appellants manipulative conduct. That was but one
    aspect of the evidence that permitted the trial judge to assess the extent of
    the appellants controlling behaviour and to draw inferences about its impact.<span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant argues that the trial
    judges interventions compromised the fairness of the trial. We do not accept
    this submission. We agree some of the trial judges comments were unfortunate
    and should have been avoided. However, assessing the record as a whole, we are
    not satisfied that they raise a concern that the trial judge prejudged the evidence,
    nor do we accept that they deprived the appellant of a fair opportunity to
    present his case. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The J.P. Conviction Appeal</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This charge arose out of an incident that
    allegedly occurred at the appellants home when J.P., a neighbour and former
    patient, visited the appellant to provide support to the appellant following
    S.P.s termination of their relationship.<span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three grounds on the
    conviction appeal relating to J.P.  The
    first is the issue of interventions by the trial judge. We have already
    disposed of that ground of appeal.<span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:
200%'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge made improper use of a prior consistent statement made by J.P. when she
    confronted the appellant on the day after the alleged assault. We do not accept
    this submission.  In our view, the trial
    judges reference to the consistency of this statement was merely a response to
    a defence attack on the improbability of J.P. returning to the appellants
    home. We are not satisfied that the trial judge used this evidence to improperly
    bolster J.P.s credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</span>Finally,
    the appellant argued that the trial engaged in speculation to fill gaps in J.P.s
    evidence.  On our reading of the trial
    judges reasons, he did not do so. <span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:
200%'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeals are therefore dismissed.</p>
