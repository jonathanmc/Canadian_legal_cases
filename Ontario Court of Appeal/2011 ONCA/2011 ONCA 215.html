    appellant was convicted of were historical – occurring between 1973 and 1995 –
    and were committed in a domestic context.  The appellant was 55 years old at the time of trial.&nbsp; There were
    four complainants; two former wives and two daughters.  The appellant was charged with a total of
    thirteen offences, which included assault, sexual assault, sexual touching,
    gross indecency, weapons dangerous and uttering a death threat.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The charges against

    was 15 years old.  She was 31 at the time
    of trial.  </span></p>

style='color:black'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s principal ground of appeal is in
    connection with the evidence of his first daughter.  He argues that the trial judge’s failure to
    resolve her earlier recantation of her allegations amounted to an error.  In his view, resolution of this issue had to
    have resulted in either the complete rejection of her evidence as being incredible,
    or at least raise a reasonable doubt.  </p>

    submits that the trial judge then fell into further error by relying on the
    first daughter’s evidence to support the testimony of other complainants.  This, he says, resulted in a number of
    critical errors.  He contends that such
    errors include: (i) a misapprehension of evidence; or (ii) a reversal of the
    burden of proof; or (iii) an unreasonable verdict.  We reject each of the appellant’s
    submissions. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span style='color:black'> </span><b>Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge correctly summarized the case before
    him as: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… <span class=GramE>a</span> case where the
    witnesses testified about incidents that occurred long ago.&nbsp; Their
    recollections were incomplete.&nbsp; There was little to corroborate the oral
    testimony of the principle parties.&nbsp; Credibility is obviously a central
    issue, as is reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the trial judge noted on several occasions in
    his reasons; he was entitled to believe all, some or none of a witness’s
    evidence.  He then conducted a thorough
    review of the evidence and considered both the credibility of the witnesses as
    well as the reliability of their evidence.  He correctly observed the difference between a witness’s credibility and
    the reliability of their evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The trial judge then
    went on and correctly recited and applied the <i>W<span class=GramE>.(</span>D.)</i><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
color:black;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> <span class=GramE>analysis</span> that was required by law in the circumstances of this case.  He found that he did not believe the
    appellant, nor was he left with a reasonable doubt as a result of his
    evidence.  No error was committed in his
    approach or analysis, and specifically, he did not reverse the onus of
    proof.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>In his analysis of the
    witnesses, the trial judge considered such factors as the potential impact of
    the passage of time; the possibility of the witness’s testimony being coloured
    by discussions between them; and any confirmatory, or lack of confirmatory
    evidence that might impact on the evidence.  He gave thorough reasons why he believed a witness and why their
    evidence was either reliable or unreliable and he was clear on how much of
    their testimony he accepted.  He did not
    misapprehend any of the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>Finally, regarding his
    principal argument, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not
    resolving the recantation issue of the first daughter.  In this regard, the appellant notes that the
    defence evidence called at trial given by the sister of the appellant was
    directly contrary to the evidence of the first daughter.  That is, contrary to the daughter’s
    testimony, the sister’s evidence was that in 1989 she did not persuade the
    daughter to recant criminal allegations she had made against her father.  The trial judge held that he was unable to
    say whether the sister had done so but that he did not need to resolve this
    issue.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>The appellant’s
    argument here is that the trial judge specifically raised an issue necessary
    for him to resolve when he said: “i</span>f I were to find that [the daughter]
    was lying about [the sister’s] involvement, then I might have concerns about
    her credibility on the whole”.  Furthermore, he notes that the trial judge did not reject the sister’s
    evidence.  Thus, he says, a decision that
    the daughter lied about why she recanted should result in a total rejection of
    her evidence, or at the least raise a reasonable doubt.  <span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>We reject this
    argument.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>In our view, and in
    all the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was correct in holding that
    the stated reasons for the witness’s recantation did not require
    resolution.  The daughter’s reasons or
    motive for having recanted her allegations against the appellant in this trial
    were only relevant to her credibility.  Indeed, as defence counsel at trial submitted to the trial judge: “[A]ll
    I intended with this witness [the appellant’s sister] was for her to counter
    [the daughter’s] evidence that she instructed her to change her statement”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>A trial judge does not
    have to resolve every discrete factual issue bearing on a witness’s credibility
    and is entitled to assess the evidence as a whole.  In our view, the daughter’s evidence and
    credibility were properly assessed by the trial judge.  In doing so he factored in the fact of the
    daughter’s recantation as well as other evidence, including his finding that </span><span
style='line-height:200%;'>the
    appellant had confessed to having assaulted the daughter sexually while he was
    in hospital recovering from a near-fatal accident.  There was no error in either the trial
    judge’s approach or his conclusion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'><span style='color:black'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>For these reasons, the

    sentencing under s. 718 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  He considered and applied the
    correct principles and fully explained his reasons for doing so.  <span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge was completely aware of the appellant’s age
    and his serious medical condition; that the offences occurred years earlier;
    and that he was essentially a first time offender.  Moreover, i</span>t is clear to us that <span
style='line-height:200%'>the principle of totality
    guided the trial <span class=GramE>judge’s</span> ultimate decision.   </span></p>

    repeatedly held that absent exceptional circumstances, adult offenders in a
    position of trust who sexually abuse children over a substantial period of time
    can expect to receive mid to upper single digit penitentiary terms: see <i>R. v. D.D.</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471

    by the trial judge in this case is entitled to considerable deference.  The appellant has failed to demonstrate that
    intervention by this court is warranted.  That is, he has failed to show that the trial judge committed an error
    in principle, or failed to consider a relevant factor, or that he placed an
    inappropriate emphasis on applicable factors.  Finally, we disagree that the sentence of four years and three months,
    in all the circumstances of this case, is a sentence that is demonstrably
    unfit. </span></p>
