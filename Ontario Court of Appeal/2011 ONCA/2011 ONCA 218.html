    pornography and unauthorized use of a computer contrary to ss. 163.1(4) and
    342.1(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. A computer
    technician at the school accessed, through the school server, the contents of
    the teacher’s laptop and found nude sexually explicit images of a grade 10
    student on the hard drive. He advised the principal, who directed the
    technician to copy the images onto a disc and required the appellant to give
    him the laptop. A school board official searched the laptop and copied
    temporary internet files from the appellant’s surfing history onto another
    disc. The two discs and the laptop were turned over to the police, who searched
    them without a warrant.</span></p>

    application, the trial judge excluded the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>, finding that the police had
    infringed the appellant’s s. 8 rights because he had a reasonable expectation
    of privacy in the laptop’s contents. On summary conviction appeal to the
    Superior Court of Justice, the appeal judge overturned the trial judge’s
    decision and sent the matter back for a retrial. The appeal judge found the
    appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his laptop. </span></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">1.         Did the appellant have a reasonable expectation of privacy in
        the contents  of the
        laptop?  </p>

      <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">4.         If so, did the trial judge err in excluding the evidence?</p>

    had a reasonable expectation of privacy from state intrusion in the personal
    use of his work computer and in the contents of his personal files on its hard drive.
    However, his expectation of privacy was modified. He had no expectation of
    privacy with respect to access to his hard drive by his employer’s technician
    for the limited purpose of maintaining the technical integrity of the school’s
    information network and the laptop. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Assuming, as I have, that the <i>Charter</i> applies to the school board, I have concluded that the
    search by the technician, the principal and the school board officials did not
    breach s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>. The
    technician was acting within the scope of his functions when he came across the
    student photographs and thus did not violate the appellant’s modified privacy
    interests. The principal and school board officials acted reasonably under the
    authority of the <i>Education Act</i> to
    protect students and a safe learning environment. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>However, the police search of the laptop and the police
    seizure of the disc containing temporary internet files from the appellant’s
    browsing history violated the appellant’s right to be secure against unreasonable
    search and seizure. I agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that this
    evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Different considerations apply to the disc containing the
    photographs delivered by the principal to the police. This evidence, like
    photographs in an envelope, did not require further search by police and the
    appellant had no continuing personal privacy interest in the images of the
    student obtained through the school system. As a result, there was no police
    search or seizure of this evidence within the meaning of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

    and I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the summary conviction
    appeal judge, substitute an order excluding the evidence of the disc containing
    the temporary internet files and the laptop and its mirror image, and remit the
    matter back to the Ontario Court of Justice for trial. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant was provided with a laptop by his school for
    use in teaching communication technology and in supervising a laptop program
    for students. He was a sitting member of the school’s technology committee and
    was one of several individuals with domain administration rights to the
    network, so that he could monitor and police the network. As a supervisor, he
    had authority to remotely access the data stored on student computers connected
    to the school network, and he did so regularly as part of his employment. The
    appellant accessed a student’s email account, found nude photographs of another
    student and copied them onto the hard drive of his school-issued laptop. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A computer technician employed by the school also had domain
    administration rights as part of his responsibility for monitoring and
    maintaining the integrity and stability of the school network. Using new
    software, he observed a large amount of activity between the appellant’s laptop
    and the school’s server so he remotely accessed the appellant’s hard drive to
    perform a virus scan and verify the system’s integrity. In doing so, the
    technician accessed a hidden folder on the hard drive. The hidden folder
    contained nude, sexually explicit images of a girl who the technician believed to
    be an underage student at the school. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The technician took a screen shot of the laptop to preserve
    the window with the appellant’s name, the path to the location of the pictures
    and some thumbnail pictures of the images.  He confirmed that the girl was a student and
    reported it to the principal.  The
    principal wanted to confirm that the girl was a student so the technician again
    accessed the appellant’s hard drive through the server and showed the principal
    only the face in the photographs. The principal asked the technician to copy
    the photos onto a disc and not to discuss it with anyone. The technician copied
    the screen shot and the photographs onto a disc and gave it to the principal. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The next morning, the principal asked the appellant to hand
    over the computer and to provide his password and contact information. The
    appellant did not provide his password but advised the principal that technicians
    would not require the password to access the computer. That same day, one of
    the school board’s technicians subsequently accessed and searched the appellant’s
    computer. He copied temporary internet files which had been in the browsing
    history of the laptop and placed them onto a disc. Those files contained large
    numbers of pornographic images. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The principal and school board officials gave police the
    laptop and the compact discs. An officer in the cyber-crime unit was assigned
    to investigate. The school board advised the officer that the laptop belonged
    to the school board. The officer was aware that teachers stored personal
    information on their laptops. He was provided with copies of the policies and
    letters indicating that teachers had personal information on their computers.
    However, the officer did not believe the data belonged to the appellant. The
    officer viewed the discs to determine whether, in his opinion, the photographs constituted
    child pornography. The appellant was subsequently arrested. Some weeks later,
    the officer sent the laptop for analysis. He did not obtain a search warrant.</span></p>

    appellant in fact had exclusive use and possession of the laptop and protected
    access to the laptop by use of a password. Teachers were permitted to use their
    computer for personal use and to take it home during weekends and vacations. </span></p>

    for all of its teachers, permitted personal use of the computer. The policy

    the nature or subject matter of the evidence gathered, whether the applicant
    had a direct interest in that subject matter, whether the applicant had a
    subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter, and whether that

    paras. 20-24, the court noted that in determining the reasonableness of the
    privacy expectation, it is a useful analytical tool to determine the nature of
    the privacy interest. In this case, the search involved both a territorial
    privacy interest in the hard drive of a computer used in part for personal use,
    and an informational privacy interest, including potentially intimate details
    of the lifestyle and personal choices of the appellant that can have a bearing
    on his “dignity, integrity and autonomy” (<i>R.

    located on someone else’s property must be one that an independent and informed
    observer is prepared to recognize as reasonable. Whether an expectation is
    objectively reasonable includes: the nature of the place where the search
    occurred; whether the informational content of the subject matter was in public
    view, had been abandoned, or was already in the hands of third parties; whether
    the police technique was intrusive in relation to the privacy interest; whether
    the evidence gathering technique was objectively unreasonable; and whether the
    informational content exposed intimate details of the appellant’s lifestyle or

    for employment purposes. Furthermore, the server, network and data belonged to
    the school board. However, the teachers were granted exclusive possession of
    the laptop, including during weekends and vacations, and were permitted to use
    the laptop for personal use. </span></p>

    teachers’ laptops. The only privacy provision in the Policy and Procedures
    Manual related to email; it emphasized that attempts would be made to request

    purposes. It did not provide for the monitoring or search of the teachers’ laptops.  </span></p>

    not agree, on whether the AUA regulating the use of student laptops also
    applied to teachers.  The AUA was signed
    by the students but not by the teachers. While the appeal judge accepted the
    principal’s testimony that he had advised teachers that all student policies
    applied to teachers as well, the terms of the AUA do not readily translate into
    a privacy policy for teachers. For example, under this agreement, students were
    advised: “Teachers and administrators may monitor all student work and email
    including material saved on laptop hard drives. Users should not assume that
    files stored on network servers or hard drives of individual computers will be
    private.” This is not consistent with the policy provisions relating to
    teachers’ emails. Nor was this term absolute: even the technician recognized
    that students had privacy interests that precluded him from reading information
    that pertained to students. </span></p>

    school policies and the AUA, given his membership in the IT committee.
    Furthermore, he was aware that others with domain administration rights to the
    network could access a laptop connected to the system since he did so regularly
    as part of his role to police student use of their laptops. However, there was
    no evidence that <span class=GramE>anyone monitored</span> or policed the
    teachers’ use of their laptops, nor did the AUA or the Policy and Procedures
    Manual address this issue. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms of the AUA
    applied to teachers, the evidence shows that they were modified by the policy

    hard drives of the laptops does not negate a reasonable expectation of privacy,
    just as the existence of a master key does not destroy the reasonable

    protected if the reasonableness of a given expectation of privacy in one’s

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>Although the hotel gave
    consent to the police to search the accused’s hotel room after cleaning staff

    an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in work computer. In <i>R. v. Little</i>, 2009 CanLII 41212 (ON
    S.C.), the application judge held that the accused had a reasonable expectation
    of privacy in the information on his work hard drive, but it was a diminished
    expectation compared to that in a home computer or a computer owned and used
    exclusively by an individual running his or her own business. In <i>France (Republic) v. Tfaily</i> (2009), 98
    O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.) [In Chambers], an application for leave to appeal, the
    question raised on appeal was whether there were sufficient grounds to issue
    warrants to search for the applicant’s work computers. The applicant was a
    professor at Carleton University. Simmons J.A. noted that university professors
    are entitled to use their work computers for personal communications and
    research and that therefore they have an objectively reasonable expectation of

    the circumstances in this case, including the factors set out in <i>Edwards</i>, the appellant had a reasonable
    expectation of privacy in the personal use of his work laptop. Although this
    was a work computer owned by the school board and issued for employment
    purposes with access to the school network, the school board gave the teachers
    possession of the laptops, explicit permission to use the laptops for personal
    use and permission to take the computers home on evenings, weekends and summer
    vacation. The teachers used their computers for personal use, they employed
    passwords to exclude others from their laptops, and they stored personal
    information on their hard drives. There was no clear and unambiguous policy to
    monitor, search or police the teachers’ use of their laptops.</span></p>

    hard drive was not in public view, was not abandoned and was not in the hands
    of third parties. While the access by the technician for the purpose of maintaining
    the integrity of the system was not intrusive or objectively unreasonable,
    access by a state actor for the purpose of determining the nature of the
    information stored by the appellant would be intrusive. Access to that
    information on the hard drive potentially exposed intimate details of the
    appellant’s personal choices and could have exposed intimate details of a
    personal nature. The appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in both
    the hard drive of the laptop and the personal information it contained.</span></p>

    had a limited right of access to the hard drive as part of his duties to
    maintain the stability and security of the network system. Business and other
    institutions commonly engage technicians to service and maintain their networks.
    Users understand that a technician can access computers connected to the
    network to ensure the integrity of the system. The appellant’s reasonable
    expectation of privacy was modified to the extent that the appellant knew that his
    employer’s technician could and would access the laptop as part of his role in
    maintaining the technical integrity of the school’s information network.
    However, this was not sufficient to displace a reasonable expectation that
    otherwise would exist in the personal electronic information maintained on his
    hard drive, except to that extent and for that limited purpose.</span></p>

    has the accused established a reasonable expectation of privacy that his

    search is whether the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy with
    respect to the technician’s limited right of access to the laptop. If not, s. 8
    of the <i>Charter</i> is not engaged.  If the technician was acting outside the
    scope of his duties when conducting the search, then the analysis shifts to the

    arise at this stage of the analysis. Furthermore, such a standard would severely
    hinder a technician’s ability to service and oversee the technical integrity of

    testified that he was responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity
    of the network. He was checking the system with new software that reported on
    activity on the network and the computers attached to it. He was accessing the
    appellant’s computer remotely because he had observed a large amount of
    activity between the appellant’s laptop and the school’s server, which could have
    been caused by a virus, but he was not sure what the cause was. He testified
    that he was also concerned because the appellant had affected the stability of
    the server in the past. He was going to perform a virus scan on the appellant’s
    “My Documents” folder in order to see if the system’s integrity was being
    compromised, when he came across a hidden folder called “New Folder”. Although
    most users would not be able to see a hidden folder, the technician had his
    computer set to reveal hidden folders. Knowing that such folders are not
    necessarily created by the user, and in the context of searching for the reason
    for the extraordinary activity, the technician accessed the folder to find out
    what it contained. When he opened the hidden folder, the numerous explicit nude

    specific reason for opening the folder that directly related to his role of
    maintaining the network. Once the folder was open, the thumbnail photographs

    school. Searching the laptop to confirm the identity of the girl in the
    pictures, seizing evidence by making a copy of the images onto a disc and
    seizing the laptop computer from the appellant were all implicitly authorized
    by law: see s. 265 of the <i>Education Act</i> and <i>M.R.M</i>. There is no suggestion

    the ‘temporary internet files’ onto a disc. The principal considered it a
    “board matter”, “investigating teacher conduct”. Obviously, the school board
    was investigating a serious allegation of teacher misconduct and a threat to
    the school environment. Officials chose to search the laptop and secure further
    evidence before handing the laptop over to the police. While there was no
    longer any immediate threat to the school, its students or the school’s
    computer network, the school board had an ongoing obligation to take steps to
    ensure a safe and secure learning environment for its students and to protect
    the students’ privacy rights. The search of the laptop and preservation of the
    evidence for an internal discipline procedure was an obvious means to do so.
    Although there was no suggestion that the images copied from the temporary
    internet files depicted any student or were obtained from the school network,
    presumably they would be evidence potentially relevant to the purpose of the

    the conduct and search of a teacher (involving a school computer and the school

    privacy was modified by the technician’s implied right of access in relation to
    maintaining the school’s network, this would not extend to a police intrusion
    to investigate a criminal offence without a warrant. The technician’s discovery
    of the photographs during the course of his implied right of access did not
    vitiate the appellant’s reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of
    his laptop in relation to the police. Although the laptop and some of the
    personal information was in the hands of a third party - the employer - as a
    result of the technician’s access, the appellant did not abandon his privacy
    interest in the personal information on the computer. Furthermore, the police

    workplace computer because the computer was the type of workplace property that
    remained within the control of the employer, even if the defendant had placed
    personal items on it. The court took the following factors into consideration:
    the information technology department had complete administrative access to all
    employee computers; the company had installed a firewall which monitored the
    flow of internet traffic; employees’ internet usage was routinely monitored and
    reviewed on a daily basis; employees were apprised of the company’s monitoring

    then gave the blood to the police to have analyzed. The Supreme Court of Canada

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>…</b> To permit such evidence to be appropriated
    by the state and thereby circumvent the <i>Hunter</i> requirement of prior authorization would be to limit unduly the privacy rights

    The police conducted a search and seizure of the laptop and seized the mirror

    appellant may have stored on it, including the photographs of his wife, without
    a warrant.  </span></p>

    internet browsing history and what it revealed about his personal predilections
    and choices. In <i>R. v. Morelli</i>, [2010]
    1 S.C.R. 253, at para. 3, the Supreme Court referred to this as “the electronic
    roadmap of your cybernetic peregrinations, where you have been and what you
    appear to have seen on the Internet”. Because the appellant had a continuing
    privacy interest in this information, the transfer of the disc with the
    temporary internet files to the police was a “seizure” within the meaning of s.
    8 of the <i>Charter</i>. </span></p>

    temporary internet files is therefore <i>prima
    facie</i> unreasonable. The onus shifts to the Crown to establish that this
    warrantless search by police was nonetheless reasonable. There were no exigent
    circumstances. Both the school environment and the evidence were secure; the
    teacher was suspended and the police were in possession of the discs and the
    laptop. The school board had no authority to consent to the search. This
    warrantless search was not reasonable. Therefore, the police violated the
    appellant’s s. 8 rights when they searched the laptop and the disc with the temporary
    internet files.</span></p>

    apply to the disc with the screen shot and the images of the student. Given
    that the photographs were taken from the school’s network, using the school’s
    computer and were the subject of the privacy interest of a student, the
    appellant had no personal privacy interest in the data. The photographs were
    found by the technician in plain view, while engaged in permissible access.
    They were lawfully seized by the principal and transferred to police. As the functional
    equivalent of photographs in an envelope, the police did not need to conduct a
    further search of this evidence. Because the appellant had no privacy interest
    in the photographs themselves (as opposed to the presence of those photographs
    in the laptop), the delivery of the disc to police was not a seizure. This
    transfer is analogous to the transfer of the drugs found in the student’s
    pocket by the vice-principal in <i>M.R.M</i>.
    In that case, the police did not require a search warrant to open the baggie and
    retrieve the drugs. Thus, the viewing of the photographs and the screen shot on
    the disc by police in this case was not a search or seizure within the meaning
    of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> and that
    evidence should not have been excluded by the trial judge.</span></p>

    seizure of the material, based on what little information was provided by
    school officials, was a serious breach of s. 8. He also held that the exclusion
    of the evidence that was unconstitutionally obtained would not bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute. Even if the nude images constituted child
    pornography (which the trial judge doubted), it would be at the bottom end of
    material of that nature, since there was no commercial or exploitative aspect
    to the production of the photographs. There was no urgency and the failure to
    obtain a warrant “constituted an egregious breach of [the appellant’s] section
    8 Charter rights, this in an age when information is often more valuable than
    the hardware it is stored in and this in an age when personal privacy is so

    get a warrant because the laptop was the property of the school board. While the
    officer’s knowledge of the surrounding circumstances, including the fact that
    teachers used the computers for personal use, should have given rise to a
    consideration of whether the appellant had some expectation of privacy in the
    laptop, there was no reckless disregard or wilful blindness because there was
    no clear appellate court authority on the issue of privacy in a workplace
    computer. However, given long established principles that ownership of property
    is not determinative, the seriousness of the violation, in these circumstances,

    Fish J. indicated for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[2]       It
    is difficult to imagine a search more intrusive, extensive, or invasive of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[3]       First,
    police officers enter your home, take possession of your computer, and carry it
    off for examination in a place unknown and inaccessible to you. There, without
    supervision or constraint, they scour the entire contents of your hard drive:
    your emails sent and received; accompanying attachments; your personal notes
    and correspondence; your meetings and appointments; <span class=GramE>your</span> medical and financial records; and all other saved documents that you have
    downloaded, copied, scanned, or created. The police scrutinize as well the

    appellant’s personal computer from his home, it is nonetheless a computer which
    he was permitted by his employer to use for personal use. The appellant had
    expressly requested that there be no access to the photographs of his wife. The
    police search in this case would reveal all personal use of the computer
    without any prior judicial authorization. Thus, this intrusion into the
    informational privacy of the appellant was significant. Searching a computer
    that is used for personal purposes is potentially among the most invasive of searches. </span></p>

    of the images on the disc, made by the technician at the direction of the
    principal, is admissible. In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that
    exclusion of this evidence would exact too great a toll on the truth-seeking
    goal of this criminal trial. Such an invasive search, conducted without prior
    judicial authorization, cannot be justified by the mere possibility that as the

    can disclose personal preferences and interests, as well as freedoms of thought
    and association, which the appellant would have a high expectation would remain
    private. As noted in <i>Morelli</i> at para.
    105, computers can “reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities,
    recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out
    and read, watch, or listen to on the Internet.”  The fact that this kind of information is often readily recoverable from
    a computer does not diminish our expectation of privacy about our actions in

    understanding of the nature of this evidence, it is quite difficult to say that
    its exclusion would undermine the fact-finding process or exact too great a
