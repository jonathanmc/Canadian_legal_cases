  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is an appeal from the
    order of the Divisional Court (Leitch, Dambrot and Swinton JJ.) dated January
    29, 2010 with leave of this court (Goudge, Sharpe and Armstrong JJ.A.) granted
    May 25, 2010.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court ordered
    that the decision of the Normal Farm Practices Protection Board (the “Board”)
    dated January 23, 2008, <span class=GramE>be</span> set aside and that the
    appellants’ application to that Board be dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board had ordered that a
    zoning by-law from the Town of Oakville (the “town”), which does not include
    farming as a permissible use of the lands, be stayed as against the
    agricultural activities of Read Farms.  In addition to setting aside the decision of
    the Board, the Divisional Court dismissed Read Farms’ application to the Board
    and awarded costs against the appellants in the sum of $22,000.  The appellants appeal from that decision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants are tenants of
    developers who own the subject lands.  Rather than pay rent for the use of the lands, they are paid by the
    landowner to farm the lands and are permitted to keep any proceeds earned from
    their operation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The town describes this
    activity as a “tax grab”.  Farm lands are
    subject to lower property taxes than are residential or industrial lands.  The appellants respond that they are engaged
    in “assessment farming”, which is a legitimate farm practice that should be
    exempted from the town’s zoning by-law.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The subject lands are divided
    into two parcels, on either side of Rebecca Street in the town. These lands
    were once owned by Shell Canada Ltd. (“Shell”).  The lands were formerly used as an oil refinery site and are said to be
    contaminated.  In 1983, Shell remediated
    the lands and obtained Certificates of Approval from the Minister of the
    Environment under the <i>Environmental
    Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>c</span>. E. 19 for the
    development of the lands. The hearing at the Board concerned only the northern
    lands.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shell sold these lands in 1999
    to Urban Core Builders Consortium Inc. which, in turn, entered into a one year
    farm lease on August 31, 2001, with Wayne Read, one of the appellants and a
    partner of Read Farms.  While the terms
    of the lease provide only for a nominal payment of $2 by the lessee to the
    lessor, the <span class=SpellE>lessor</span> developer pays to the lessee
    farmer $300 per workable acre each year. This payment has been described as
    “reverse rent”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In alternate years, the
    appellants grow winter wheat on the lands which they sell for human consumption
    but which they cannot sell for animal consumption.  In the other years they rotate barley and
    clover crops which they do not harvest but plough under.  These restrictions are the result of a
    Ministry of Environment Order, which also provides that the northern lands
    cannot be used for residential occupation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But for the reverse rent
    payment from the owner of the lands to the appellants, the farming operations
    carried out on the subject lands each year would result in a financial loss to
    the appellants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In July 2002, the owner of the
    lands was charged with: “Using land for a purpose not permitted, namely
    farming/growth of crops contrary to Town of Oakville By-law 1984-63.” The
    zoning by-law was passed by Council on November 22, 1984 and approved by the
    Ontario Municipal Board on August 1, 1985.  The subject lands are presently zoned “E1” – employment zone 1,
    providing for office, daycare, drive through facility, hotel, light industrial,
    vehicle repair or vehicle dealership; “E2” – employment zone 2, providing for a
    broad range of employment uses, including outside storage, transportation
    terminal and waste processing station; and “T1” providing for other commercial
    uses.  There is no mention of farming or
    agriculture being a permitted use.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants, after the
    charge was laid, brought the within application pursuant to s. 6(2) of the <i>Farming and Food Production Protection Act</i>, <i>1998</i>, S.O. 1998, c. 1 (the “Act”)
    before the Board for a determination as to whether their operation was a normal
    farm practice for the purpose of the non-application of the municipal
    by-law.  That charge remains in abeyance
    pending the outcome of this litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sections 6(1) and 6(2) of the
    Act provide:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       No
    municipal by-law applies to restrict a normal farm practice carried on as part
    of an agricultural operation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       A
    person described in subsection (3) or a municipality may apply to the Board, in
    a form acceptable to it for a determination as to whether a practice is a normal
    farm practice for purposes of the non-application of a municipal by-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was on the basis of this
    section that the appellants made their application to the Board.  After it became aware of the application, the
    town brought a motion before the Vice Chair of the Board seeking an order
    dismissing the appellants’ application for want of jurisdiction by the Board
    or, in the alternative, an order refusing to hear the appellants’ application
    to the Board.  The Board identified the
    issues on the motion as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>1.         Was this a proper
    case for the Board to refuse to hear the application based upon a lack of
    jurisdiction?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>2.         Was this a proper
    case for the Board to refuse to hear the application because the main purpose
    of the application is other than to be able to carry on a normal farm practice,
    as provided in s. 6(5)?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>3.         Was this a proper
    case for the Board to refuse to hear the application pursuant to s. 8(1) of the
    Act because the application is frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board dismissed the
    motion.  On the first issue, the Vice
    Chair held that there was sufficient information in the application to “attract
    the jurisdiction of the Board”. He opined that to allow the introduction of
    evidence by way of affidavit on a motion to challenge jurisdiction would amount
    to pre-judging the case without the benefit of a full hearing with <i>viva voce </i>evidence and
    cross-examination.  He concluded that the
    appellants’ allegations of the essential elements required by s. 6 to establish
    jurisdiction of the Board were sufficient to “attract jurisdiction” and that
    the Board should proceed to a full hearing.  I do not read this as deciding the issue of jurisdiction at this stage
    but, rather, as holding that there was sufficient information in the application
    to permit a hearing to proceed where the issue of jurisdiction might be fully
    explored on <i>viva voce</i> evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As to the second issue, the
    town alleged that the primary reason for the appellants’ application was to
    reduce the landowner’s realty tax obligation to the town.  There were significant tax savings to the
    landowner if the appellants were permitted to continue farming operations on
    these lands.  On this issue, the Vice Chair
    concluded that the appellants had raised “agricultural issues” that were not
    without merit when viewed in the context of the factual situation. As the
    determinations made would have significant ramifications for farmers,
    developers and municipalities, he would not refuse a hearing under s. 6(5) of
    the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As to the third issue, the Vice
    Chair concluded that the application raised novel and genuine issues and was
    not frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The town appealed this ruling
    to the Divisional Court.  The appeal was
    dismissed.  The farm owners argued there
    was no right to appeal the Vice Chair’s decision because it was an interim or
    interlocutory ruling rather than a final order. They also argued that the court
    ought not to entertain the appeal because it was premature.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court agreed
    with the farm owners’ position that it ought not to intervene.  In its reasons, the Divisional Court
    concluded that s. 8(2) of the Act authorizes an appeal by any “party to a
    hearing” and that the Board had not yet held a hearing.  All that the Board had decided was that it would
    hold a hearing on the merits.  The court
    held that even if there was a right of appeal from a preliminary ruling, the
    Board had not made any ruling on its jurisdiction and it was careful not to
    make any finding on the merits. The Divisional Court concluded that the Board
    should be permitted to proceed with a hearing, wherein:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Board will be required in that process to
    interpret its own legislation and consider the nature of its own jurisdiction
    under that legislation. The Board ought to be given the opportunity to make
    that determination first before this Court intervenes. If the Board errs and
    exceeds its jurisdiction, there is an appeal right and any decision this Court
    may make at that stage will be informed not only by a full evidentiary record,
    but also by the views of the Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The matter then proceeded to a
    hearing before the Board and in reasons released January 23, 2008, the majority
    of the Board granted the application and ordered that the town’s By-law No.
    1984-63 be stayed as against the applicants’ agricultural activities. In his
    dissenting reasons, the Chair of the Board (former Vice Chair) would have
    dismissed the application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The town appealed the decision
    of the Board to the Divisional Court, which allowed the appeal and dismissed the
    appellants’ application. That court concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that the majority reasons of the Board were so
    deficient as to constitute “no reasons”. Before this court, the appellants and
    the respondent agree that the majority reasons are deficient and that if this
    were the only error, the appropriate disposition would have been to remit the
    matter to the Board for re-hearing.  I
    agree that the majority reasons of the Board are merely conclusory and lack any
    analysis of the evidence, the relevant statutory provisions and the
    issues.  However, this case does not fall
    to be determined on the insufficiency of the majority’s reasons, nor was that
    the basis on which the Divisional Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the appellants’
    application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court went
    further and concluded that it was able to dispose of the appeal without the
    need to return the matter to the Board.  As it stated in paras. 47 and 48 of its reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[47]     But
    in the end, in my view, we are at liberty to decide for ourselves the question
    of whether or not Read Farms was conducting a normal farm practice because it
    is readily answered as a matter of law without the need to resolve any conflict
    in the evidence lead by the parties. Since our conclusion does not depend on
    any evidence that is in dispute, I will not further review the evidence lead in
    relation to this issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[48]     The
    matter of law that I have in mind involves the proper interpretation of the
    Act.  While ordinarily this Court is
    obliged to defer to a tribunal’s interpretation of its own statute, no
    deference is owed in a case such as this one where the majority makes no effort
    to explain either the meaning they attribute to the language of their home
    statute or its application to the evidence before them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The court went on to conclude
    that as a matter of law, “farming” was not a “farm practice” and further that
    normal farm practices are “farming techniques and methods that are of a
    requisite standard or established and followed by similar agricultural
    operations (see <i>Bluewater</i> at para.
    50).”  The court concluded that farming
    merely describes the use to which the land is put.  The appellants’ position was simply that they
    were prohibited from farming.  The court
    held at para. 53 that s. 6 of the Act <span class=GramE>was</span> intended as
    a “shield to protect legitimate farmers with legitimate farming operations from
    having the use of normal farm practices restricted.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Essentially, the Divisional
    Court applied the Act and concluded that the appellants’ farming operation was
    not a “normal farm practice” and hence s. 6(1) did not apply.  The court allowed the appeal, set aside the
    decision of the Board and dismissed the application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I
    agree with the disposition made by the Divisional court and I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The analysis must begin with a
    consideration of the zoning by-law that is the subject of the application and
    which governs the use of the lands in question. The subject lands are presently
    zoned “E1” – employment zone 1; “E2” – employment zone 2; and “T1” providing
    for other commercial uses.  There is no
    mention of farming or agriculture being a permitted use.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants brought their
    application under s. 6(2) of the Act and sought an order from the Board that
    would permit them to carry on their farming operation on the subject

    with nuisance lawsuits by neighbouring residents.  This Act replaced the former <i>Farming Practices Protection Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. F.6 and added a wider variety of nuisances that would be covered.  This is also confirmed in the preamble, which
    recognizes that agricultural activities may cause discomfort and inconveniences
    to those on adjacent lands.  As one
    member of the legislature stated: “We want to be able to make sure that with
    those who move from small urban or large urban areas into the farm area, for
    reasons usually of quality of life, that won’t affect the ability of farmers to

    Act, the Hansard debates reveal that the main concern over municipal by-laws
    was that they might become “unduly restrictive” or “unnecessarily restrictive”
    and therefore interfere with legitimate agricultural operations.  One member of the legislature put it this
    way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    new act would deal constructively with emerging concerns around unduly
    restrictive municipal bylaws. The ministry, farm groups and municipalities will
    work together to increase awareness among municipal decision-makers about
    modern farming practices so that the future bylaws can be drafted with full
    recognition of the demands of running a farming operation.</span></p>

    “unduly restrictive” or “unnecessarily restrictive” municipal by-laws make it
    clear that the Act was intended to deal with municipal by-laws that limit the
    ability of normal farm practices to be carried out <i>on land that was meant for farming purposes</i>.  A municipal zoning by-law that has designated
    land as non-farming land does not fall within the purview of s. 6(1) of the
    Act, as it is not a by-law that is unduly restrictive of legitimate farming
    practices.  Rather, the zoning by-law is
    a complete and legitimate prohibition on the <i>use</i> of the land for farming purposes.  To read the Act as being applicable to zoning
    land use would mean that farmers could set up farms wherever they wanted, even
    in areas that have been designated for other legitimate land use purposes.  That could not have been the intention of the
    legislature.</span></p>

    or silvicultural operation” shall be construed to include. A list of activities
    follows – all of which might generically be referenced to activities which relate
    to various farming activities – such as draining, irrigating or cultivating
    land; the production of eggs, cream and milk; ground and aerial spraying; and
    activities that are a necessary but ancillary part of an agricultural operation
    such as the movement of transport vehicles for the purpose of the agricultural
    operation.  These activities presuppose
    that farming itself is permitted on the land.</span></p>

    by-laws is narrow.  Section 6(15) sets

    lands <span class=GramE>that are</span> not zoned for farming.  It had nothing to do with whether their practice
    was a “normal farm practice” for the purpose of the non-application of the
    zoning by-law.  In my view, the Board has
    no jurisdiction to make such an order and the Act has no application in these
    circumstances.  As the Vice Chair (now
    Chair) of the Board noted in his decision on the town’s preliminary motion on
    jurisdiction:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although this Board has made a number of decisions
    giving relief to farmers under Section 6 of the Act with respect to the

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That is precisely the
    difference. The Board may have power to order that some restrictive provision
    of a zoning by-law does not apply so as to restrict a normal farm practice

    jurisdiction to grant relief from the use provisions of a zoning by-law.</span></p>

    submission that this court’s decision in <i>Bluewater </i>provides to the contrary, that is a misreading of that case.  <i>Bluewater</i> had nothing to do with land use.  All
    that <i>Bluewater</i> determined was that
    the term “municipal by-law” in s. 6 included a municipal zoning by-law.  In <i>Bluewater</i>,
    farming was permitted by the zoning by-law and what the applicant sought was a
    variance from the setback requirements of the zoning by-law – a case very

    statutory interpretation requires the courts to consider the applicable legislation
    in its entirety and to read the impugned provision harmoniously with the scheme
    of the statute in question.  In addition
    to the preamble making reference to “agricultural lands”, s. 10 of the Act
    makes reference to certain regulations that the Act allows the Minister to
    make.  Section 10(a)(iii) says that the
    Minister may make regulations, “prescribing, for the purpose of the definition
    of ‘agricultural operation’, other agricultural activity, <i>conducted on, in or over agricultural land</i>” (emphasis added).</span></p>

    farming practice must be a practice that is carried out on land for which
    farming is permitted is further confirmed by s. 6(16) of the Act, which sets
    out the three types of decisions that the Board can issue.  Section 6(16)(c) says that the Board can
    determine that a farm practice will be a normal farm practice “if the farmer
    makes specific modifications in the practice within the time set out in the
    decision.”  If the subject lands in
    question are not zoned for agricultural purposes, there is nothing a farmer can
    do to bring his farm practice in compliance with the definition of “normal farm
    practice” in the Act.  This is because s.
    6(1) deals only with restricted practices, not with land uses.</span></p>
