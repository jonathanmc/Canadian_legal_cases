    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 provides the legal authority for the police to demand that
    a driver provide a breath sample through an approved screening device, if the
    officer has “reasonable grounds to suspect” that the person operating the motor
    vehicle has alcohol in their system.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    through the use of a roadside screening device, which the person blows into.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Irma Rivera, was pulled over by a police officer who was
    conducting R.I.D.E. checks of motorists.  The officer formed the suspicion that
    she had consumed alcohol and could be impaired.  He demanded a roadside sample
    of the appellant’s breath. The appellant made 21 attempts to provide a sample.
    While attempting to provide a sample, she made various statements to the
    officer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police officer concluded that the appellant was not genuinely trying
    to provide a sample and charged her with <span style='line-height:200%'>refusal
    to comply with a demand for a breath sample without reasonable excuse under s.
    254(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i></span>.  After a trial, she was convicted as
    charged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>While the appellant advances five
    discrete grounds of appeal in this court, two are of particular interest. 
    First, Ms. Rivera contends that the trial judge relied on statements made by
    her before the right to counsel was provided to draw adverse inferences
    regarding her credibility.  Second, Ms. Rivera argues that the trial judge
    failed to consider her s. 7 <i>Charter</i> argument. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the first day of trial, defence counsel requested an
    adjournment for the purpose of following up on medical reports that indicated
    the appellant might have a defence of reasonable excuse to the charge, based on
    an alleged lack of capacity to blow by reason of a panic attack.  The Crown did
    not oppose the adjournment.  Counsel agreed that Constable Tai, the arresting
    officer who was available in court that day, would testify and that, following his
    testimony, the trial would be adjourned to accommodate preparation of and the
    Crown’s response to the proposed defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In chief, Constable Tai testified that, about 2:02 a.m. on
    December 7, 2005, he observed a vehicle driven by the appellant exiting a
    sports bar.  Constable Tai, in the course of conducting the R.I.D.E. program,
    followed the appellant as she turned into a private drive, and drove through
    the parking lot of a nearby business.  Constable Tai stopped her car in the
    parking lot.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Following the stop, Constable Tai approached
    the appellant and detected an odour of alcohol on her breath.  When the
    appellant stepped out of her vehicle, Constable Tai observed that she was
    unsteady on her feet.  He formed the suspicion that the appellant could have
    been impaired by alcohol.  Constable Tai made a demand of the appellant to
    provide a breath sample into an improved screening device.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At this point in the evidence,
    defence counsel indicated he would not contest the presence of reasonable
    grounds for the officer to make the demand.  </span>In addition, the defence
    did not challenge the procedure followed in administering the breath test nor
    suggest that the screening device was faulty or otherwise not in proper working
    order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>After the defence concession, the
    Crown examined Constable Tai concerning what he asked the appellant to do and
    her responses.  Constable Tai testified that the appellant responded on two
    occasions that she had consumed “three glasses of wine”.  Later, she said: “I
    only had two glasses of wine” and, later still, claimed: “I only had one
    beer.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Constable Tai also explained the
    process of the appellant’s attempts to respond to his instructions on how to furnish
    a breath sample. He said that, after nine attempts, the appellant said, “I work
    for you. I work in the office.” After 10 attempts, Constable Tai told the
    appellant that he could charge her criminally if she failed to provide a
    suitable sample.  She responded by saying: “I work for the O.P.P.  I’ll lose my
    job, don’t do this to me.  I only had one beer.  I was just taking myself home.” 
    After 15 attempts, she said, “Why are you doing this to me?  There are
    criminals out there.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>After her 18th unsuccessful
    attempt, Constable Tai arrested the appellant for failing to provide a proper
    breath sample.  At that point, she stated: “Give me another chance.  Don’t do
    this to me.  I don’t want to lose my job.  Why are you doing this to me?”  In
    response to her request for “another chance”, Constable Tai again demonstrated
    how to give a proper breath sample and provided the appellant three more
    opportunities to furnish a breath sample.  However, the appellant’s renewed
    attempts to provide a sample again failed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Constable Tai testified that,
    between about 2:04 a.m., when the breath demand was made, and approximately
    2:34 a.m., the appellant made a total of 21 attempts to provide a breath
    sample. Over that period, and despite repeated instructions from Constable Tai
    and demonstrations by him on how to breathe into the screening device, no
    readings resulted from the appellant blowing into the machine. At 2:40 a.m.,
    Constable Tai placed the appellant under arrest and informed her of her right
    to counsel.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In chief, Constable Tai testified
    that he did not specifically ask the appellant why she was not providing a
    proper sample. He also testified that, at no point during their interactions, did
    the appellant suggest that she was ill or experiencing any medical
    difficulties.  Nor did she offer any other explanation as to why she could not
    provide a breath sample.  While he described the appellant as being initially
    co-operative, he  testified that she gradually became unco-operative and
    verbally combative, and called him racial names.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In cross-examination, Constable
    Tai said that the appellant was fidgeting and moving around a lot in the back
    seat of the police cruiser.  He stated that she was unfocused and that he had
    difficulty getting her to understand what was taking place. He said that he was
    not convinced the appellant was “faking” for the first 10 attempts, but he
    continued in attempting to administer the test beyond the point of forming the
    opinion that she was wilfully failing to provide a proper sample.  He
    acknowledged that it was possible that the appellant’s breathing was quick, but
    he did not recall her taking shorter than normal breaths or exhibiting shallow
    breathing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On re-examination, Constable Tai
    suggested that the appellant’s behaviour was indicative of not physically
    wanting to be in the back of his cruiser.  He also stated that the only short
    breaths she took were her exhales into the screening device.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>When the trial resumed almost one
    year later, the appellant testified in her own defence.  She said that she
    experienced breathing problems on entering the police cruiser and that pain in
    her chest prevented her from blowing properly into the screening device.  She
    claimed that she had experienced a panic attack and that she was concerned that
    she might faint or have a heart attack.  She stated that the attack commenced
    when she entered the police cruiser and continued until her arrest about 30
    minutes later.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In cross-examination, the
    appellant claimed that during this 30-minute period, she experienced several
    symptoms of a panic attack, including chest pain, an inability to control her
    breathing and to think clearly, fear that she might faint or have a heart
    attack, shaking, tingling in her arms, perspiration, and a tendency to say
    “silly things”.  She maintained that it would be obvious to an observer that
    something was wrong with her if she was having a panic attack.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant also indicated that
    she became impatient, wanted to leave, and did not want to deal with the
    situation.  She acknowledged that, contrary to her statements to Constable Tai,
    she did not work directly for the O.P.P., but stated that the company she works
    for makes “devices” for the O.P.P. and Peel Police.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant also testified that
    she was frustrated she could not provide the sample, that she could not think,
    and that she did not tell the officer she was having pain or could not
    breathe.  She described her mind as “black and white”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The defence called expert medical
    evidence regarding the symptoms of anxiety disorder, including panic attacks. 
    Based on their observations of her in 2006, Dr. Roldan, a psychiatrist, and Dr.
    Morrell-Bellai, a clinical psychologist, both diagnosed the appellant as
    suffering from panic disorder.  The appellant’s statements were given a place
    of prominence in the Crown’s cross-examination of the experts.  Crown counsel specifically
    cross-examined each expert about the significance of the appellant’s statements
    to the officer, and inquired whether lying was a symptom or result of a panic
    attack.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Trial Judge’s Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After reviewing the facts, the trial judge accepted that “extreme
    anxiety, as well as panic” could explain a failure to provide a breath sample
    and provide a defence to the charge under s. 254(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. 
    She also accepted the evidence of Constable Tai and the accuracy of the
    statements he attributed to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that the
    appellant “rationally and intentionally” told an untruth to the officer when
    she said that she worked in the policing field.  She also found that the
    appellant subjectively believed that this untruth “may advantage her in some
    way.”  The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that she did not
    remember telling the officer that she worked for the O.P.P.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge noted that the
    appellant was inconsistent in her statements to the officer about the amount of
    alcohol she had consumed.  She stated: “The lies the appellant told the officer
    at the roadside clearly undermine her credibility, and undermine the portion of
    expert opinion evidence based on her self-reporting [to the expert
    witnesses].”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge accepted Constable
    Tai’s evidence that there were “no outward symptoms observable of physical
    distress” during his dealings with the appellant, nor did she complain of any
    medical problems during these dealings.  As stated by the trial judge,
    Constable Tai “did not notice any shortness of breath, or other signs of extreme
    anxiety ... [but] only saw indications of nervousness, and later hostility.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    any shortness of breath, or other signs of extreme anxiety”.  The trial judge

    suspicion that the motorist might be impaired or over the legal limit.  Such

    nor did the trial judge use them as such.  Rather, as the trial judge was urged
    to do by the trial Crown in closing submissions, the roadside statements were
    used to ground adverse credibility findings against the appellant and to reject

    because the statements were not elicited or conscripted through questioning by
    the arresting officer, but rather were uttered spontaneously by the appellant,
    it was open to the trial judge to use the statements in assessing her
    credibility.  The Crown points to <i>Hanneson</i>, <i>R. v. Richards</i> (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 737 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 41-45, <i>R. v. Ha</i>, 2010

    readings taken at the police station.  This evidence consisted of testimony
    regarding how much alcohol the accused actually consumed and the opinion of a

    that it was constitutionally permissible to require a detained motorist to
    participate in sobriety and roadside tests without being advised of his or her
    s. 10(b) rights<i> </i>– “hinged on the fact that such tests were not meant to
    provide the police with a means of gathering evidence that could later be used
    at trial to incriminate the motorist on a charge of impaired driving or driving
    over 80.”  Rather, he went on to say:</span></p>

    constitutionally permissible, roadside test results are admissible only for the

    unsuccessful attempts to give a sample, following which the officer warned her
    that if she did not provide an adequate sample, she could be charged under the <i>Criminal

    point, the accused responded: “I have asthma.  I had my last drink at 10:45
    tonight in Newmarket at the bar I work at.”  The appellant’s agent at trial,

    that she had the drink at 10:45 and said she had told the officer it was
    between 10 and 10:30 p.m.  She explained that she referred to it as her “last

    Molloy J. pointed out that roadside statements made without the right to

    Furthermore, she noted that statements that are part of the <i>actus reus</i> of an offence are always admissible:  see <i>Stapleton</i>. </span> </p>

    the principles underlying this court’s decisions in <i>Milne</i> and <i>Coutts</i> preclude the use of roadside utterances made without the right to counsel for
    purposes of impeaching an accused’s credibility.  In applying this distinction
    to the roadside utterances of the appellant in that case, Molloy J. held, at
    paras. 35-36:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, any statements made by Ms. Morrison as
    to the process of attempting to give the breath sample are admissible to
    demonstrate whether she was really trying or whether there was some valid basis
    for her not being able to comply.  However, her statements as to what she had
    to drink, and when, have no bearing on whether she properly complied with the
    demand for a breath sample.  They are relevant only to credibility.  If Ms.
    Morrison had taken the breathalyser test and then been charged with impaired
    driving, her statements at the roadside as to her drinking would not be
    admissible to attack her credibility:  <i>R. v. Coutts</i>.  I see no
    principled basis for treating those statements differently in the situation
    before me than would be the case if Ms. Morrison had been charged with impaired
    driving.   Accordingly, in my view, using the roadside statements to undermine
    her credibility was an impermissible use of that evidence and a breach of her <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, both statements should be treated the
    same way.  Although the second utterance during the attempts to provide a
    breath sample was not in immediate response to a question from the officer, it
    was all part of the same transaction, while Ms. Morrison was still being
    detained, and in the course of the officer’s overall inquiry.  It was simply a
    carry-over of her earlier statement and was so closely connected to the first
    statement temporally and contextually that there is no rational basis for
    treating them differently:  <i>R. v. Plaha</i> (2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 289
    (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, Molloy J. treated the second statement of the accused as having

    detained, even though the statement was not “in immediate response to a
    question from the officer”.  </p>

    After his second attempt, the officer warned the accused that if he was not
    blowing properly, he would be charged with refusing to provide a breath
    sample.  Prior to his fourth attempt, the officer noted that the accused
    remarked: “I don’t care, charge me, I don’t care”.  The officer then arrested

    about the accused’s statement that he had done a previous test in the past, as
    well as his remark “I don’t care, charge me, I don’t care”, without any
    argument from counsel about the admissibility of these utterances.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that you did not comply with the demand by

    adverse credibility findings.” In rejecting this ground of appeal, Hill J.

    whether his conduct amounted to “faking or feigning” an attempt to comply, “</span>the <i>actus reus</i> of refusal, depends on the totality of the circumstances. Evidence
    of a refusal may arise from conduct of the detained motorist, his or her

    compelled direct participation of a detained motorist, Hill J. expressed the
    opinion, at para. 32, that where a roadside statement of an accused is made
    voluntarily, without being elicited by the arresting officer, it is admissible
    for purposes of assessing guilt or innocence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here, unlike the situation where a police officer
    asks a detained motorist whether he or she has consumed alcohol, and if so,
    when and how much, the constable did not ask Mr. Bijelic whether he had been
    subjected to ASD testing on a prior occasion.&nbsp;  The appellant volunteered
    the statement of prior experience – it was not conscripted or “elicited” as
    that term is understood in the context of ss. 7 and 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Smith</i>, <a name=reflex-caselaw-54559702></a>[2008] O.J. No. 623

    (3d) 530 (Ont. C.A.) at para. </span>4, 29, 35.&nbsp;There is no evidence of a
    ploy or manipulation of the appellant raising compulsion to inform the officer
    that he was familiar with a breath-testing device.&nbsp; There was no legal
    compulsion to speak.&nbsp;  The appellant, for his own motives, chose to do
    so.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the <i>Elias/Milne/Coutts</i> line of

    inapplicable where the statement of the accused forms part of the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence, citing this court’s decision in <i>Hanneson</i>, at pp. 471-3.  (See
    also this court’s decisions in <i>Richards</i>, at paras. 43-45 and <i>Ha</i>, at
    paras. 6-8.) According to Hill J., the prior experience statement related to
    the issue of guilt or innocence, because it was relevant to the appellant’s
    “understanding of the constable’s directions and the genuineness of his efforts
    to comply”: <i>Hanneson</i>, at para. 36.  </p>

    concluded that the roadside statements were admissible for two reasons.  First,
    the statements were admissible as the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence.

    appellant’s evidence, the Crown stated: “When put to Ms. Rivera in

    reasons, the trial judge held:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She also was inconsistent
    on the quantity and nature of the alcohol consumed when speaking to the
    officer, and at the trial.  She gave inconsistent statements about the amount
    of alcohol she had consumed.  Her answers varied between three (3) glasses of
    wine, two (2) glasses of wine, one (1) beer, and one-third of three 750 ml
    bottles of wine.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The lies Ms. Rivera told the officer at the
    roadside clearly undermines her credibility, and undermines the portion of
    expert opinion evidence based on her self-reporting.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rational thought associated with these

    how roadside statements could provide evidence of the <i>actus reus</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span style='color:black'>[A]ny
    statements made by Ms. Morrison as to the process of attempting to give the
    breath sample are admissible to demonstrate whether she was really trying or
    whether there was some valid basis for her not being able to comply.&nbsp;
    However, her statements as to what she had to drink, and when, have no bearing
    on whether she properly complied with the demand for a breath sample.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Clearly, if an accused made a
    roadside statement that related directly to the refusal, it would then be open
    to the Crown to lead that evidence as establishing the <i>actus reus</i> of the
    offence. The accused’s statement in <i>Bijelic, </i>“I don’t care, charge me”,
    provides a good example of a statement that is properly admitted as evidence of
    the <i>actus reus</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In contrast, by way of example, the
    appellant’s differing descriptions of the amount and type of alcohol she had to
    drink and her statements to the effect that she worked for the O.P.P., cannot
    accurately be characterized as evidence of the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence
    of refusal in the circumstances.  Her various statements about the amount she
    had to drink could not be taken as indicating that she was refusing or failing
    to give a breath sample.  This is also the case with her statements</span><span
style='line-height:200%'> – </span><span style='line-height:200%'>“I work for
    the O.P.P. I’ll lose my job” and, “<i>Give me another chance. </i> Don’t do
    this to me.  I don’t want to lose my job.  Why are you doing this to me?” (emphasis
    added). These statements cannot be said to constitute the gravamen or
    foundation of the offence of refusal or failure to blow, as contemplated by
    this court </span><span style='line-height:200%'>i</span><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>In general, it will fall to the trial
    judge to determine on the facts of the case whether a particular roadside
    statement can properly be considered as evidence of the <i>actus reus</i>.  In
    this case, there was other evidence of the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence
    based on Constable Tai’s testimony. This included the appellant’s numerous
    unsuccessful attempts to provide a breath sample and that she did not appear to
    be experiencing breathing difficulties. The officer’s observations about the
    motorist’s conduct and demeanour while detained at the roadside were clearly
    admissible to prove the offence, as explained in <i>Elias</i>, at para. 58 and <i>Milne</i>,
    at p. 590.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My third reason for rejecting the admission of all the appellant’s roadside
    statements as evidence of th<i>e actus reus</i> is in connection with the
    Crown’s suggestion that a court may treat all roadside utterances as evidence
    of the <i>actus reus</i> in a case of a feigned attempt to provide a breath
    sample. Such a suggestion runs afoul of the <i>Elias</i>/<i>Milne</i>/<i>Coutts</i> line of authority on the limited use to which such evidence may be put.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that this line of authority is directed at the use of
    roadside statements for purposes of proving the offences of “over 80” or
    driving while impaired, rather than refusal or failure to provide a breath
    sample.  Nevertheless, I share Molloy J.’s views in <i>Morrison</i>, at para.
    35:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If Ms. Morrison had taken the breathalyzer test and
    then been charged with impaired driving, her statements at the roadside as to
    her drinking would not be admissible to attack her credibility: <i>&nbsp;R. v.
    Coutts.</i>&nbsp; I see no principled basis for treating those statements
    differently in the situation before me than would be the case if Ms. Morrison
    had been charged with impaired driving.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Elias</i>/<i>Milne</i>/<i>Coutts</i> line of authority
    establish that it would be unfair to give broad incriminatory scope to evidence
    obtained from a motorist who is detained at a roadside stop and whose s. 10(b)
    rights are suspended.  As stated at p. 298 of <i>Coutts</i>:  “The unfairness
    arises because the motorist has been compelled, at the behest of the state, to
    provide evidence that would not have been obtained but for the motorist’s
    participation in its construction and the evidence is being tendered for a
    purpose beyond that contemplated by s. 254(2) of the <i>Code</i>”. See also <i>R.
    v. Smith</i> (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 75 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 87.  </p>

    authorities is that the analysis is not limited to situations in which a breath
    sample was ultimately provided; rather, it is equally applicable to a case
    involving a failure to provide a breath sample, itself a criminal offence.  </span><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>If the court were to treat roadside
    statements as evidence of the <i>actus reus</i> even if the statements did not
    indicate the act of refusal, the unfairness averted to in <i>Coutts</i> would
    re-surface.</span></p>

    question from the panel, there was some suggestion that the trial judge ought
    to have conducted a <i>voir dire</i> before permitting the Crown to lead evidence
    of the appellant’s roadside statements from Constable Tai.  The need for a <i>voir
    dire</i> could arise in respect of two discrete issues: (i) in connection with
    those statements that are relied on by the Crown to constitute the <i>actus
    reus</i>; and (ii) whether the statements, though not evidence of the <i>actus

    raised the <i>voir dire</i> issue during the Crown’s cross-examination of the
    appellant on her statements to Constable Tai.  Defence counsel stated:  “I’m a
    little concerned … In the normal course of an impaired these are pre-right to
    counsel utterances.  The issue of credibility.”  The trial judge asked:  “Well,
    these are admissible without the necessity of a <i>voir dire</i> on a refuse
    case, are they not?”  Counsel responded with “[t]hank you”.  The issue of the
    need for a <i>voir dire</i> was not pursued.</span></p>

    with “failing to or refusing to comply with a valid demand made to him by a

    accused to the police that are made without the right to counsel as evidence of
    the <i>actus reus</i>, the trial judge may be called upon to decide whether the
    proffered statements are evidence of this element of the offence before

    that purpose. This is due to the trial fairness considerations explained in the <i>Elias</i>/<i>Milne</i>/<i>Coutts</i> line of authority described above.    </span></p>

    to incriminate an accused and evidence used to impeach.  In that case, Moldaver
    J.A. observed that the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Calder</i>, [1996] 1
    S.C.R. 660 held that there is no meaningful distinction for purposes of
    admitting unconstitutionally-obtained evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter </i>between evidence used to incriminate and evidence used to impeach an
    accused’s testimony on cross-examination.  As Sopinka J. said at para. 34:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The effect of destroying the credibility of an
    accused who takes the stand in his or her defence using evidence obtained from
    the mouth of the accused in breach of his or her <i>Charter</i> rights will
    usually have the same effect as use of the same evidence when adduced by the
    Crown in its case in chief for the purpose of incrimination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of course, there is no constitutional violation in police
    obtaining statements from  motorists without having been advised of their s.
    10(b) rights in the roadside stop context, but that is only because roadside
    stops have been found to be constitutionally permissible  under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    Critical to the finding that roadside testing is not unconstitutional is the
    limited use to which evidence obtained during the roadside stop may be put, as
    explained in <i>Elias</i>, at para. 58:  “the evidence obtained as a result of
    the motorist’s participation without the right to counsel can only be used as
    an investigative tool to confirm or reject the officer’s suspicion that the
    driver might be impaired.  It cannot be used as direct evidence to incriminate

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    admissible as part of the Crown’s case for incrimination or impeachment
    purposes. I agree with Molloy J.’s conclusion in <i>Morrison</i> that roadside
    statements, whether made in direct response to an inquiry by an officer, or
    made in the context of the officer’s overall inquiry while the motorist is
    detained, are not admissible for purposes of attacking the accused’s

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge made various references to the appellant’s silence regarding the reason
    for her failure to blow at paras. 11, 19, 66, and 75 of her reasons for
    decision.  They are summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. Rivera did not indicate any illnesses or
    medical difficulties to the police officer, nor did she indicate any reason(s)
    why she could not provide a sample … Ms. Rivera did not tell the officer that
    she was having a panic attack at any time ….  I further accept Constable Tai’s
    evidence that there were no outward symptoms observable of physical distress
    nor did Ms. Rivera complain of any medical problem throughout his dealings with
    her … She never showed any overt signs of anxiety or panic attack, nor did she
    make any complaint to the officer.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before the summary conviction appeal court judge, the appellant’s
    counsel argued that the trial judge erred in her assessment of the appellant’s
    credibility, and in rejecting her testimony that she suffered a panic attack at
    the roadside, by relying on her failure to say anything to Constable Tai about
    her supposed panic attack.  The appellant contends that the trial judge’s
    repeated reliance on her “silence” on the issue of the panic attack was not a proper
    consideration on the issue of her credibility because of the right to silence
    enshrined by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>

    court judge’s reasons for dismissing this ground of appeal leave “something to
    be desired.”  He further acknowledges that “[i]t is difficult to discern why
    this ground of appeal was rejected.”  Indeed, it is impossible and this court
    is, therefore, entitled to intervene to address the merits of this ground of
    appeal.  The appeal court judge’s complete failure to address this ground of

    of appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the right to silence
    jurisprudence on which the appellant relies is not applicable in this case.
    This, he says, is because the onus was on the appellant to establish a
    reasonable excuse for her failure to provide a sample.  According to the Crown,
    an accused ought to make timely disclosure of that excuse to permit the police
    to address the issue. The Crown cites <i>R. v. Ferron</i> (</span><span

    because the reasonable excuse is extraneous to the elements of the offence (see <i>Moser</i> (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 737, at pp. 750 and 754), when the appellant’s
    silence is used in assessing the credibility of her reasonable excuse, it is
    not used to prove guilt and thus s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> is not violated.  I

    silence on the issue of a reasonable excuse at the time of arrest in rejecting
    the accused’s evidence at trial of a reasonable excuse.  In other words,
    because the appellant said nothing at the time of her arrest explaining her
    failure to blow, can that be a basis for disbelieving her trial evidence of a
    reasonable excuse? </span></p>

    the right to silence is irrelevant to any issue at trial:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, when it is the accused whose testimony is
    being impeached, an allegation that he or she did not speak out, or give an

    precluded from making the allegation, <i>and no inference can be drawn that if

    firearm after a sawed-off shotgun was found under his bed in his condominium

    had come from. He also testified that an acquaintance had used his condo unit

    accused chose to speak to the police at the time of her arrest for possession
    of cocaine, but she did not give the police the explanation she would later
    advance at trial as to why the cocaine was in her possession.  This court held,
    at para. 9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was open to the trial judge to reject the
    appellant’s explanation given at trial because it was not believable and to use

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I conclude that the trial judge erred </span>by
    improperly relying on certain statements that the appellant made to the
    arresting police officer to undermine her credibility at trial.<span
lang=EN-US>  </span>I also conclude that the appeal court judge erred by
    failing to properly consider the appellant’s argument regarding her right to
    silence under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  After examining the merits of this
    ground of appeal, it is my opinion that the trial judge’s repeated reliance on the
    appellant’s “silence” on the issue of the panic attack was not a proper
    consideration on the issue of credibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no need to conduct an analysis of the admissibility of
    evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. The roadside statements are
    inadmissible for impeachment purposes not because of a breach of s. 10(b) of
    the <i>Charter</i>, but rather because of the limited use to which such
    evidence may be put to ensure a fair trial as explained in <i>Elias/Milne/Coutts</i>.
    Thus, s. 24(2) is not engaged. Similarly, the s. 7 claim relates to the trial
    judge’s improper use of the appellant’s silence on the issue of the panic
    attack, rather than to unconstitutionally-obtained evidence, and so there is no
    need to assess admissibility under s. 24(2).  </p>
