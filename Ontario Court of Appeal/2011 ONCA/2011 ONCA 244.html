  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since 1965, all
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    newborn infants have been routinely and impersonally screened through the
    administration of a blood test (the “Guthrie test”) for the presence of phenylketonuria,
    a congenital disorder also known as PKU.  This case concerns testing for PKU.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PKU is caused by a defect in the activity of the
    phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme, resulting in the body’s inability to
    metabolize phenylalanine (“phe”), an amino acid.  If left untreated, PKU can interfere with
    normal brain development and, among other things, result in permanent brain
    damage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Guthrie test is part of the Ontario Newborn
    Screening Program and aims to identify those infants with treatable forms of
    PKU as early as possible.  Infants with
    PKU normally begin treatment around one month of age. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1996, the testing of all newborn blood specimens for
    PKU in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    was done by the Laboratory Services Branch of the Ministry of Health (the
    “Crown Lab”).  Results from Guthrie tests
    were reported back to one of five regional consultants under the Ontario
    Newborn Screening Program.  The regional
    consultant in the respondent Tyler Cleveland’s case was the appellant, Dr.
    Thomas Whelan.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge recognized, correctly, that the law
    required that Dr. Whelan’s conduct be assessed on the basis of “the degree of
    care and skill which would reasonably be expected of a prudent and careful
    practitioner of the same experience and standing in the same circumstances”:
    see <i>Crits v. Sylvester</i>, [1956] O.R.
    132 (C.A.), at p. 143, aff’d [1956] 1 S.C.R. 991.  In Dr. Whelan’s case, the degree of skill
    required was that of a similarly situated and experienced metabolic specialist.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further indicated that, “[t]he honest
    and intelligent exercise of judgment satisfies [a practitioner’s] professional
    obligation to take reasonable care in the circumstances, although he may have
    been wrong” (citations omitted).  This,
    too, was correct.</p>

    phe levels requiring treatment had been reported in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Tyler’s case.  However, the relevant question was why a

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the important question that Dr. Whelan had to answer
    was whether it was safe to discharge
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler
    from further follow-up.  He could not
    answer that question without a diagnostic test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the trial judge concluded that Dr.
    Whelan’s conduct fell below the standard of care in ordering a third Guthrie
    test in circumstances where the reasonable and prudent decision was to order a
    quantitative diagnostic test.  She found
    that Dr. Whelan committed “a negligent error of clinical judgment”.  However, she held that Dr. Whelan bore a
    lesser degree of fault than the Crown.  The trial judge apportioned liability 75% to the Crown and 25% to Dr.
    Whelan.  Dr. Whelan appeals the trial
    judge’s liability decision.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although Dr. Whelan raises several grounds of
    appeal, his core argument is that this appeal concerns his discretion to choose
    between two tests to rule out PKU in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler.  He submits that there were no practice
    protocols in place at the relevant time which expressed the applicable standard
    of care in the circumstances.  Thus, he says,
    in the absence of a recognized standard of care, the decision as to which test
    should be administered was within the exercise of his clinical judgment, based
    on his clinical experience. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
class=decision>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Whelan goes on to argue that reasonable
    physicians could disagree as to which test was the most appropriate test to
    administer.  Accordingly, there had to be
    good reasons, grounded in recognized clinical practice, for holding that his
    exercise of judgment fell below the standard of care.  <span class=decision><span style='line-height:200%;'>   </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=decision><span style='line-height:200%;'>The essence of Dr. Whelan’s
    argument is that, </span></span>in arriving at her findings of fact, the trial
    judge ignored, disregarded, or misapprehended the evidence of his expert
    witness, Dr. Clarke.  In support of this
    argument, he submits that the trial judge failed to apply <i>ter Neuzen v. Korn</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 674, and the line of cases
    associated with it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%;'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]</span></span></span></span></a>  In <i>ter
    Neuzen</i> at para. 38, the Supreme Court held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is generally accepted that when a doctor acts in
    accordance with a recognized and respectable practice of the profession, he or
    she will not be found to be negligent.… <span lang=FR-CA>As L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated in [<i>Lapointe
    v. Hôpital Le Gardeur</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 351]…(at pp. 363-64):</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Given the number of available methods of
    treatment from which medical professionals must at times choose, and the
    distinction between error and fault, <i>a
    doctor will not be found liable if the diagnosis and treatment given to a
    patient correspond to those recognized by medical science at the time, even in
    the face of competing theories</i>.  [Emphasis in original.]   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has recognized this principle in numerous
    cases.  See for example, <i>Connell v. Tanner</i> (2002), 158 O.A.C.
    268; <i>Rowlands v. Wright</i> (2009), 250
    O.A.C. 394; <i>Brain v. Mador</i> (1985), 9
    O.A.C. 87, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1985), 13 O.A.C. 79 (note)
    (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Whelan’s submissions suggest that if a defendant is
    able to advance proof that one reputable body in the community of medical
    professionals in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    at the time of the incident would support the conduct and decision making of
    the defendant, the trial judge is virtually compelled to accept that evidence
    and find against negligence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument proceeds on the premise that by ignoring
    or misapplying the applicable authorities, the trial judge misdirected herself
    on the law of negligence, leading her to wrongly disregard the defence expert
    evidence.  Dr. Whelan also argues that
    the trial judge’s failure to adequately consider the defence expert evidence resulted
    in palpable and overriding errors of factual determination on both negligence
    and causation issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, on the other hand, submit that in all
    cases of medical malpractice, the question is whether there was a duty of care
    between the doctor and patient and, if so, whether the standard of care that
    applied in all the circumstances was breached, leading to damages.  If Dr. Whelan’s approach were taken to the
    extreme, they argue, it would unfairly insulate physicians from liability in
    all cases where conflicting expert evidence as to the standard of care is led.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents contend that the overarching theme of
    Dr. Whelan’s arguments is simply that the trial judge should have accepted the
    evidence of Dr. Whelan and his expert, Dr. Clarke, over the evidence led by the
    respondents through their experts, Dr. Vallance and Dr. Chakraborty.  The respondents say that Dr. Whelan’s claim
    that he was engaged in the exercise of clinical judgment is not supported by
    the trial judge’s findings of fact or by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  First, I disagree with Dr. Whelan’s
    contention that the principles enunciated in <i>ter Neuzen</i> are engaged in this case.  I conclude that the trial judge’s
    interpretation and application of the law were correct.  Second, in my view, the trial judge did not
    ignore, misapprehend or misapply the evidence.  Indeed, I conclude that her findings were based on a fair and proper
    consideration of all the evidence.</p>

    the first question for the court to decide in a negligence action is whether
    the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.  If a duty is owed, the second question is

    prefer the practice of the majority over that of the respectable minority.  In other words, a doctor who acts in
    accordance with a respectable minority body of medical opinion will normally be
    absolved of negligence: see for example, Ellen I. Picard &amp; Gerald R.

    supported by Dr. Chakraborty’s testimony, constituted evidence of a respectable
    minority body of medical opinion on the established practice for a third PKU
    test in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    circumstances.  As his actions conformed
    with that body of opinion, Dr. Whelan maintains that the trial judge erred in
    finding him negligent.</span></p>

    is not a case where the trial judge erred by simply preferring one body of
    medical opinion over another respectable and competing body of medical opinion
    concerning the appropriate medical practice.  This is a case where the trial judge
    considered and weighed the conflicting testimony of the expert witnesses on the
    operative standard of care.  She
    concluded that Dr. Clarke’s opinion on the standard of care suffered from a
    number of frailties and was not sufficiently reliable to establish the existence
    of a respectable minority opinion.  The
    trial judge therefore accepted the evidence of Dr. Vallance and that of Dr.
    Chakraborty that, in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    case, after two consecutive abnormal phe values on Guthrie tests, the standard

    doing so.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his testimony, Dr. Clarke emphasized that at the time of the original testing
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    blood specimens, it was common practice to conduct repeat Guthrie tests until
    it was determined whether hyperphe was treatable.  He said that two successive Guthrie test
    results of 240 </span><i>&#956;</i><span
lang=EN-US>mol/L were “suspicious” but that
    this was insufficient to require diagnostic investigation since the second test
    result indicated that the patient’s phe level had not risen.  In the absence of a rise in the phe level by
    the time of the second test, Dr. Clarke was of the opinion that it was less
    likely that treatable hyperphe would develop.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge concluded that there were three key difficulties with Dr. Clarke’s
    evidence on this issue.  First, his
    opinion rested on the premise that the relevant question at the time of
    determining the appropriate third test was whether
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Tyler had developed treatable hyperphe.  However, the trial judge held that “the
    important question that Dr. Whelan had to answer was whether it was safe to
    discharge [
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler]
    from further follow-up”, and that this question could not be answered without a
    diagnostic, rather than a repeat screening, test.  In other words, the necessary inquiry was
    whether treatment or early intervention was necessary.  The evidence of both Dr. Vallance and Dr.
    Chakraborty supported this finding. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    example, Dr. Vallance testified that after a second positive phe result, as
    occurred in this case, a baby has about a 50% chance of being diagnosed with
    PKU or a variant.  Although Dr. Clarke
    disagreed, Dr. Chakraborty criticized Dr. Clarke’s analysis and expressed the
    opinion that after a second Guthrie test resulting in a borderline positive phe
    value, a patient is at increased risk of having PKU.  In his view, the available scientific data
    supported up to a 50% chance of some babies being diagnosed with PKU after a
    second positive phe result.  Accordingly,
    in these circumstances, a quantitative test should be conducted to determine if
    treatment or early intervention is required.  The trial judge accepted this evidence,
    stating:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Two
    elevated [phe] results should have raised a level of suspicion that [
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler] may have had PKU or
    a variant and diagnostic testing was required. This is reinforced by the fact
    that the concentration measured using the semi-quantitative Guthrie test can vary
    by &#8805; 100 </span><i>&#956;</i><span
lang=EN-US>mol/L.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the trial judge, in effect, concluded that Dr. Clarke’s evidence on the
    significance of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    first two phe values was internally inconsistent.  Dr. Clarke testified that two elevated phe
    values at the cut-off point of the Guthrie test were “suspicious”.  However, he also suggested that the second phe
    level had not risen over the first and, therefore, there was a reduced
    likelihood of the development of treatable hyperphe. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge rejected this inconsistent hypothesis.  She put it this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    do not understand how a second positive Guthrie at 240 </span><i>&#956;</i><span lang=EN-US>mol/L can be both reassuring and suspicious…. On Dr. Clarke’s analysis,
    a third screen [a third Guthrie test] with no rise in phe would be more rather
    than less reassuring.</span></p>
  <p style='

    contrary to Dr. Clarke’s contention that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    second Guthrie test result indicated no rise in his phe level, there was
    evidence at trial indicating that, properly interpreted and taking account of
    various specimen storage factors and laboratory errors, it was likely that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s true phe value was
    rising between his first and second Guthrie tests.  As I have already indicated, the trial judge

    true phe value on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    second Guthrie test was “closer to 480 </span><i>&#956;</i><span lang=EN-US>mol/L”.  There was ample evidence at trial to support

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    Dr. Whelan’s evidence of his own practice did not accord with Dr. Clarke’s view
    that diagnostic testing was not required until evidence of treatable hyperphe
    had emerged.  Dr. Whelan testified that
    babies with three successive Guthrie test results at <i>untreatable</i> phe levels of 240 </span><i>&#956;</i><span lang=EN-US>mol/L were
    subjected to diagnostic testing.  In
    other words, Dr. Whelan’s practice at the relevant time did not support the
    suggestion that diagnostic testing need not be undertaken until an indication
    of treatable hyperphe, evidenced by a rise in phe levels, existed.</span></p>

    courts have the discretion to assess liability even in the face of
    uncontradicted evidence of common professional practice.  As L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated in <i>Roberge v. Bolduc</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 374,
    at p. 437:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge essentially concluded
    that the expert evidence did not establish that Dr. Whelan’s decision to order
    a third Guthrie test in the face of two successive borderline elevated phe
    levels, instead of ordering a diagnostic test, accorded with a practice adopted
    by a respectable minority of the medical profession. In other words, on the

    such a diagnostic test.  The answer was
    that he had not and thus that he had breached the standard of care.  One could imagine a case where the factual
    determination of whether or not a breach had occurred would be more complicated
    and perhaps require further expert evidence, but that was not the case here. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Attack on Trial Judge’s Factual Findings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I noted above, the overarching theme of Dr. Whelan’s
    arguments is that the trial judge should have accepted the evidence of Dr.
    Whelan and his expert over the evidence of the respondents’ experts.  In this context, he attacks the trial judge’s
    factual findings on several grounds.  I
    view it as unnecessary to address each of these grounds separately.  Rather, I will discuss those submissions that
    I believe have relative merit.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Dr. Whelan’s clinical judgment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first argument relates to the trial judge’s finding
    that Dr.&nbsp;Whelan negligently exercised his clinical judgment in choosing a
    third Guthrie test because he did not inform himself as to whether
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler had any condition
    which would cause benign transient hyperphe.  Dr. Whelan contends that the judge erred in making this finding.  I would reject this submission for several
    reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as I have said, Dr. Whalen asserts that there
    were no practice protocols in place that expressed the standard of care in the
    circumstances of this case.  That is, at
    the time of the 1996 testing, no protocol existed to guide the Ontario Newborn
    Screening Program or any of its five regional centre staff as to the
    appropriate test to be conducted following two borderline elevated phe values
    in a newborn on Guthrie tests.  Therefore, he says, the decision was one for the exercise of his clinical
    judgment, based on his clinical experience.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Whelan’s counsel in oral argument stated that
    clinical judgment, in this case, means “adopting a protocol or standing order
    which is informed by the doctor’s clinical experience and consistent with logic
    and common sense”.  Thus, he argued, the
    decision in question was a matter about which reasonable physicians could
    disagree.  Accordingly, there had to be
    good reasons, grounded in recognized clinical practice, for holding that Dr.
    Whelan’s exercise of judgment fell below the standard of care.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Whelan, as regional consultant, was responsible for
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tyler’s case.  However, he did not actively take part in any
    decision making regarding his case.  
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tyler’s test results were
    received and managed by a genetic counsellor at Dr. Whelan’s offices, Tim
    Heshka, pursuant to routine and standing orders provided by Dr. Whelan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in spite of his position, Dr. Whelan does not
    appear to have made any specific clinical decisions with respect to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler.  As found by the trial judge, Tyler’s third
    repeat Guthrie test arose as a result of Tim Heshka following the routine
    standing orders of Dr. Whelan.  It was
    not the result of a conscious decision that was specifically and particularly
    related to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was very much alive to this issue,
    noting that “the honest and intelligent exercise of judgment”, even if
    mistaken, satisfies a doctor’s professional obligation to take reasonable care
    in the circumstances.  In para. 55 of her
    reasons, she rejected the argument that what occurred in this case was the
    exercise of clinical judgment by Dr. Whelan.  After reviewing the relevant evidence, she
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tyler
    had none of [the factors that might suggest transient benign hyperphe], but Dr.
    Whalen did not know this, nor did he seek out this information. This kind of
    information could have provided some reassurance that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Tyler’s elevations were transient, but
    without it, I find it difficult to accept that the routine third test that Mr.
    Heshka arranged was based on an exercise of Dr. Whalen’s clinical judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%;'>In light of this finding, Dr.&nbsp;Whelan’s
    assertion that he exercised clinical judgment is without any factual
    support.  </span>Dr. Whelan’s evidence as
    to the reasonableness of a decision that was not made by him, as the
    respondents note, is no more than historical reconstruction posed in a way that
    was designed to give it the appearance of immediate direct contemplative
    thought.  No such contemplation occurred
    here.  <span style='line-height:200%;'>I would reject this
    argument.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       The trial judge’s treatment of expert evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, Dr. Whelan submits that the evidence of Dr.
    Chakraborty should have been given less weight than it was.  This is because, in his testimony, Dr.
    Chakraborty acknowledged that providing an opinion in this case required him to
    apply in a retrospective way what he knows now but did not know in 1996.  And, as the trial judge noted at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Hindsight has no role to play in evaluating conduct
    that is said to fall below a reasonable standard of care.  Practices change and standards evolve.  As much as possible, one must try to go back
    and experience the event as it was then. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Whelan’s counsel at trial objected to Dr.
    Chakraborty’s qualifications to give expert evidence on the standard of care as
    it existed in 1996.  Dr. Chakraborty, who
    is the current head of the Ontario Newborn Screening Program, had his
    qualifications carefully reviewed by the trial judge as a result of this
    challenge.  The trial judge held that he
    was qualified to provide the proffered opinion evidence.  That ruling has not been appealed.  The trial judge, therefore, was entitled to
    consider Dr. Chakraborty’s expert opinion evidence and to assign to it the
    weight, if any, that she considered appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, even if the trial judge had given little or no
    weight to Dr. Chakraborty’s evidence, the evidence of Dr. Vallance still
    conflicts with that of Dr. Clarke.  Moreover, for the reasons I have outlined above, the trial judge would
    still have had a firm basis on which to reject the evidence of Dr. Clarke.  There is, therefore, no substance to this
    argument.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     The effect of two positive phe results </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Dr. Whelan argues that because PKU is
    associated with high concentrations of phe long before one month of age,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s results were not
    indicative of PKU.  After the second
    test, Dr. Whelan thought that the likelihood of PKU had diminished. This was
    because, in his opinion, the phe concentration did not rise in the five days
    between
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    first and second Guthrie tests.  Therefore,
    he felt a third screening test was appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have already discussed the trial judge’s
    consideration of this issue.  She found
    as a fact, on all the expert evidence, that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Tyler’s phe level was likely rising between
    his first and second Guthrie tests.  This
    finding was open to her on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in his own evidence, Dr. Whelan said that he
    would have sent
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler for quantitative testing
    had
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    third screen resulted in a phe value at or above 240 <i>µ</i>mol/L.  Thus, in effect, Dr.
    Whelan testified that two borderline screens plus a third borderline elevated
    result suggest transient benign hyperphe.  There was no explanation as to why three borderline positive phe values within
    one month would be significantly more cause for concern than two, given the
    evidence that transient hyperphe may last longer than a few weeks.  Why would three borderline positive screens
    call for quantitative testing, while two borderline positive screens would not?
     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents’ experts, Dr. Vallance and Dr.
    Chakraborty, both testified that in light of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s
    two positive phe test results, the standard of care at the time required that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tyler’s condition should
    be individually and personally investigated clinically.  This direct approach, they said, would

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All the respondents’ experts agreed that the amino acid

    himself.  I would dismiss this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that Dr. Whelan has not provided any grounds
    for this court to interfere with the decision of the trial judge.  First, the trial judge’s determination of
    what constituted the standard of care and her application of that standard of
    care to Dr. Whelan’s conduct were correct.  Second, the findings of the trial judge were
    supported by the evidence presented to her.  She was entitled to accept or reject all or part of the evidence of any
    witness.  And, on my review of her
    reasons and the record as a whole, I conclude that Dr. Whelan has not established
    that the trial judge committed any palpable and overriding errors that would
    support this court’s intervention.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[73]<span

    appeal.  Pursuant to the agreement of the
    parties, I would award the respondents their costs of the appeal, fixed in the
    amount of $25,000, inclusive of disbursements and taxes.</p>

    is true that this principle is sometimes referred to as the <i>ter Neuzen</i> principle, this naming is
    unhelpful because <i>ter Neuzen</i> involved
    two distinct principles.  Although the
    court did mention what is known as the respectable minority principle, the
    focus of the decision was the principle that in some cases the trier of fact
    can reject a standard medical practice as inherently negligent where the
    practice is “fraught with obvious risks”: see <i>ter Neuzen</i> at paras. 41-42.</p>
