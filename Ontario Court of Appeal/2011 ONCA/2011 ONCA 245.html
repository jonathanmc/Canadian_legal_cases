  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. Although the trial judge
    found that the appellant met the <i>Criminal Code</i> criteria for being a
    dangerous offender, he designated him a long term offender as he concluded that
    there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk he posed.
    During the dangerous offender proceedings, the appellant pleaded guilty to
    assault, criminal harassment, violation of a s. 515(12) order and failing to
    comply with probation. These offences related to the same complainant but
    pre-dated his trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment in addition to 31
    months of pre-sentence custody, to be followed by a long term offender
    supervision order in the community for 10 years. He seeks leave to appeal
    sentence on a single issue: whether the trial judge erred in failing to give
    enhanced credit for the appellants pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no basis on which to interfere with the sentencing judges
    exercise of discretion in determining the credit to be given for the
    pre-sentence custody or with the sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge gave reasons for exercising his discretion to
    credit pre-sentence custody time on a 1 for 1 basis, including that he found it
    unlikely, based on the appellants record, that the appellant would be eligible
    for early release. This is a legitimate consideration and one that, on the
    record, the sentencing judge was entitled to make.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another consideration was that the sentencing judge had found that the
    appellant met the dangerous offender criteria. It is in this context that the
    sentencing judge found the appellants dangerousness to be a relevant
    consideration on the issue of credit to be given for pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the total sentence was fit and not rendered manifestly unfit by
    reason of pre-sentence custody being credited on a 1 for 1 basis, rather than
    on a 2 for 1 or 1.5 for 1 basis, as the appellant contends. The instant offences
    included acts of forced fellatio and anal rape on a vulnerable victim with
    intellectual disabilities. It was a significant aggravating factor that the
    offences took place within a domestic relationship. At the time of the
    offences, the appellant was on probation having only recently been released for
    violent offences against another domestic partner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
