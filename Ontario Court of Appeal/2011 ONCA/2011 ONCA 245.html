  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. Although the trial judge
    found that the appellant met the <i>Criminal Code</i> criteria for being a
    dangerous offender, he designated him a long term offender as he concluded that
    there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk he posed.
    During the dangerous offender proceedings, the appellant pleaded guilty to
    assault, criminal harassment, violation of a s. 515(12) order and failing to
    comply with probation. These offences related to the same complainant but
    pre-dated his trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment in addition to 31
    months of pre-sentence custody, to be followed by a long term offender
    supervision order in the community for 10 years. He seeks leave to appeal
    sentence on a single issue: whether the trial judge erred in failing to give
    enhanced credit for the appellant’s pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no basis on which to interfere with the sentencing judge’s
    exercise of discretion in determining the credit to be given for the
    pre-sentence custody or with the sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge gave reasons for exercising his discretion to
    credit pre-sentence custody time on a 1 for 1 basis, including that he found it
    unlikely, based on the appellant’s record, that the appellant would be eligible
    for early release. This is a legitimate consideration and one that, on the
    record, the sentencing judge was entitled to make.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another consideration was that the sentencing judge had found that the
    appellant met the dangerous offender criteria. It is in this context that the
    sentencing judge found the appellant’s dangerousness to be a relevant
    consideration on the issue of credit to be given for pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the total sentence was fit and not rendered manifestly unfit by
    reason of pre-sentence custody being credited on a 1 for 1 basis, rather than
    on a 2 for 1 or 1.5 for 1 basis, as the appellant contends. The instant offences
    included acts of forced fellatio and anal rape on a vulnerable victim with
    intellectual disabilities. It was a significant aggravating factor that the
    offences took place within a domestic relationship. At the time of the
    offences, the appellant was on probation having only recently been released for
    violent offences against another domestic partner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
