  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A Canadian company is insolvent.  Its pension plans are underfunded and in the
    process of being wound up.  The company
    is the administrator of the pension plans.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The company obtains protection under the <i>Companies'
    Creditors Arrangement Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as amended (<i>CCAA</i>).  A court order enables it to borrow funds pursuant to a
    debtor-in-possession (DIP) credit agreement.  The order creates a “super-priority” charge in favour of the DIP
    lenders.  The obligation to repay the DIP
    lenders is guaranteed by the company’s U.S. parent company (the Guarantee).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The company is sold through the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings but the sale proceeds are insufficient to repay
    the DIP lenders.  The U.S. parent company
    covers the shortfall, in accordance with its obligations under the Guarantee.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CCAA </i>monitor
    holds some of the sale proceeds in a reserve fund.  The pension plan beneficiaries claim the money
    based on the deemed trust provisions in the <i>Pension
    Benefits Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8 (<i>PBA</i>).  The U.S. parent company claims the money based
    on its payment under the Guarantee.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Must the money in the reserve fund be used to pay the
    deficiencies in the pension plans in preference to the secured creditor?  What fiduciary obligations, if any, does the
    company have in respect of its underfunded pension plans during the <i>CCAA </i>proceeding?  These appeals wrestle with these difficult questions.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited was the sponsor
    and administrator of two registered pension plans: the Retirement Plan for
    Salaried Employees of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited and Associated
    Companies (the Salaried Plan) and the Retirement Plan for Executive Employees
    of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited and Associated Companies (the
    Executive Plan) (collectively, the Plans).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 20, 2009, <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> parent company and its U.S. based affiliates (collectively, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S.) sought Chapter 11 protection in the United States.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 3, 2009, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Holdings (B.C.) Ltd., 6326765 Canada
    Inc. and Novar Inc. (<span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> or the Applicants)
    obtained protection from their creditors under the <i>CCAA</i>.  At that time, the
    Salaried Plan was in the process of being wound up.  Both Plans were underfunded.  FTI Consulting Canada ULC (the Monitor) was
    appointed as monitor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 8, 2009, the court authorized <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to borrow funds pursuant to a DIP credit agreement.  The court order gave the DIP lenders a
    super-priority charge on <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> property.  <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S.
    guaranteed <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> obligation to repay the DIP
    lenders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 20, 2009, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> moved for approval of the sale of its assets on a going-concern basis.  It also moved for approval to distribute the
    sale proceeds to the DIP lenders, with the result that there would be nothing
    to fund the deficiencies in the Plans.  Without further payments, the underfunded status of the Plans will
    translate into significant cuts to the retirees’ pension benefits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the sale approval hearing, the United Steelworkers appeared
    on behalf of its members who had been employed by <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> and are the beneficiaries of the Salaried Plan (the USW).  In addition, a group of retired executives appeared
    on behalf of the beneficiaries of the Executive Plan (the Former Executives).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the USW and the Former Executives objected to the
    planned distribution of the sale proceeds.  They asked that an amount representing the total underfunding of the
    Plans (the Deficiencies) be retained by the Monitor as undistributed proceeds,
    pending further court order.  Their
    position was based on, among other things, the deemed trust provisions in the <i>PBA </i>that apply to unpaid amounts owing
    to a pension plan by an employer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court approved the sale.  However, as a result of the USW and Former
    Executives’ reservation of rights, the Monitor retained an additional $6.75
    million of the sale proceeds in reserve (the Reserve Fund), an amount
    approximating the Deficiencies.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sale closed on July 31, 2009.  The sale proceeds were insufficient to repay
    the DIP lenders.  <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. paid the shortfall of approximately US$10.75 million, pursuant to its
    obligations under the Guarantee.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with a process designed by the <i>CCAA </i>court, the USW and the Former
    Executives brought motions returnable on August 28, 2009, based on their deemed
    trust claims.  They claimed the Reserve Fund
    was subject to deemed trusts in favour of the Plans’ beneficiaries and should be
    paid into the Plans in priority to <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S.  They also claimed that during the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> breached its fiduciary obligations to the Plans’ beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> then brought a motion
    in which it sought to lift the stay and assign itself into bankruptcy (the <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> bankruptcy motion).  This motion was directed to be heard on August 28, 2009, along with the
    USW and Former Executives’ motions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By orders dated February 18, 2010, (the Orders under
    Appeal), the<i> CCAA</i> judge dismissed the
    USW and Former Executives’ motions on the basis that, at the date of sale, no deemed
    trust under the <i>PBA </i>had arisen in
    respect of either plan.  He found it
    unnecessary to decide the <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> bankruptcy motion.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The USW and the Former Executives (together, the
    appellants) appeal.  They ask this court
    to order the Monitor to pay the Reserve Fund to the Plans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 5, 2009, the Superintendent of Financial
    Services (Superintendent) appointed the actuarial firm of <span class=SpellE>Morneau</span> <span class=SpellE>Sobeco</span> Limited Partnership (<span class=SpellE>Morneau</span>)
    as administrator of the Plans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Morneau</span> was granted <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sun <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span>, as the principal
    secured creditor of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S., asks that the
    appeals be dismissed and the Reserve Fund be paid to it.  As a result of its payment under the
    Guarantee, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. is subrogated to the rights
    of the DIP lenders.  Its claim to the
    Reserve Fund is based on the super-priority charge.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Monitor appeared.  It supports Sun <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> and asks that the

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited is a Canadian
    corporation.  It is the entity through
    which the <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> group of companies operates in
    Canada.  It is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary
    of its U.S. parent, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Holding Corp., which in
    turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Finance.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Together, the group of companies referred to as <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> and <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. were the
    second largest manufacturer of aluminum extrusions in the United States and
    Canada.  Aluminum is a durable, light
    weight metal that can be strengthened through the extrusion process, which
    involves pushing aluminum through a die and forming it into strips, which can
    then be customized for a wide array of end-user markets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited produced a
    portion of the raw material used in the extrusion process, called aluminum
    extrusion billets, through its casting division located in Toronto.  It also processed the raw extrusion billets
    into extruded product at its Canadian extrusion plants, for sale to end
    users.  In 2008, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited accounted for approximately 32% of the <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> group of <span class=GramE>companies</span> total sales to third parties.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited provided
    separate pension plans for its executives and salaried employees.  The Plans were designed to pay pension
    benefits for the lives of the retirees and those of their designated
    beneficiaries.  <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> Limited was the sponsor and administrator of both Plans.  The Plans were registered with the Financial
    Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) and the Canadian Revenue Agency.   </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a term of the sale, SAPA assumed no responsibility

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the Former Executives and the USW objected to the
    planned distribution of the sale proceeds.  They asserted statutory deemed trust claims in respect of the
    underfunded pension liabilities in the Plans, arguing that preference was to be
    given for amounts owing to the Plans pursuant to ss. 57 and 75 of the <i>PBA</i>.  They also relied on s. 30(7) of the Ontario <i>Personal Property
    Security Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 (<i>PPSA)</i>, which expressly gives priority to the deemed trust in the <i>PBA </i>over secured creditors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Former Executives and the USW further argued that <span

    beneficiaries by failing to adequately meet its obligations under the Plans and
    by abdicating its responsibilities as administrator once <i>CCAA </i>proceedings had been undertaken.  </p>

    approximating the Deficiencies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was agreed that an expedited hearing process would

    were insufficient to repay the DIP loan in full.  The Monitor made a payment of

    resulted in a shortfall of US$10,751,247.22 in respect of the DIP borrowings.  The DIP Agent called on the Guarantee for the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CCAA judge dismissed the Former Executives’ motion
    on the basis that since the wind up of the Executive Plan had not yet taken
    place, there were no deficiencies in payments to that plan as of July 20, 2009.  As there were no deficiencies in payments, there
    was no basis for a deemed trust.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the Salaried Plan was in the process of being

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CCAA judge saw the issue raised on the USW motion
    to be whether the <i>PBA</i> required <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to pay the windup deficiency in the Salaried Plan as
    at the date of closing of the sale and transfer of assets, namely, July 20,
    2009.  In resolving the issue, the <i>CCAA </i>judge considered ss. 57 and 75 of
    the <i>PBA</i>.  He called attention to the words “accrued to
    the date of the wind up but not yet due” in s. 57(4).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CCAA </i>judge
    also considered ss. 31(1) and (2) of R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 909 (the Regulations).  He concluded that because s. 31 of the
    Regulations permitted <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to make up the
    deficiency in the Salaried Plan over a period of years, the amount of the
    yearly payments did not become due until it was required to be paid.  Were it not for s. 31 of the Regulations, the <i>CCAA </i>judge stated that <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> would have had an obligation under the <i>PBA </i>to pay in any deficiency as of the
    date of wind up.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CCAA judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[49] … I find that as of the date of closing and
    transfer of assets there were no amounts that were &quot;due&quot; or
    &quot;accruing due&quot; on July 20, 2010.  On that date, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> was not required under
    the <i>PBA</i> or the Regulations <span
class=SpellE>thereunder</span> to pay any amount into the [Salaried] Plan.
    There was an annual payment that would have become payable as at December 31,
    2009 but for the stay provided for in the Initial Order under the CCAA.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[50] Since as of July 20, 2009, there was no amount
    due or payable, no deemed trust arose in respect of the remaining deficiency
    arising as at the date of wind-up.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[51] Since under the initial order priority was
    given to the DIP Lenders, they are entitled to be repaid the amounts currently
    held in escrow.  Those entitled to windup
    deficiency remain as of that date unsecured creditors.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the centrality of the wind up process to these
    appeals, I will briefly outline the salient aspects of the wind up process
    before turning to a consideration of each of these issues.    </p>
  <h4>WINDING UP A PENSION PLAN <i><span style='font-weight:normal'> </span></i><span lang=EN-US>      </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To understand the wind up process, one must first
    understand how the pension plan operates while it is ongoing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A pension plan to which the employees contribute is
    called a contributory plan.  In the case
    of contributory plans, the employer is obliged to remit the employee
    contributions, including payroll deductions, within a specified time
    frame.  This aspect of an employer’s
    obligations does not arise in these appeals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to remitting the employee contributions, if
    any, while a defined benefit pension plan is ongoing, the employer must make
    two types of contributions to ensure that the plan is adequately funded and
    capable of paying the promised pension benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1. <b>Current service or “normal cost” contributions</b> – the employer
    contributions necessary to pay for current service costs in respect of benefits
    that are currently accruing to members as a result of their ongoing
    participation in the plan as active employees.  These must be made in monthly instalments within 30 days after the month
    to which they relate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.  <b>Special payments</b> – a plan
    administrator must file an actuarial report annually in which the pension plan
    is valued on two different bases:  a
    “going-concern” basis, where it is assumed the plan will continue to operate
    indefinitely; and a “solvency” basis, where it is assumed that the employer
    will discontinue its business and wind up its plan.  If the actuarial report discloses a going-concern
    liability, the employer is required to make monthly special payments over a 15
    year period to fund the unfunded liability.  If the actuarial report discloses a solvency deficiency, the employer is
    required to make monthly special payments over a 5 year period to fund the
    deficiency.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to understand that the solvency
    valuation is not the same thing as a wind up report.  To repeat, the solvency valuation is prepared
    while the pension plan is ongoing.  A
    solvency valuation is required while the plan is ongoing because it is crucial
    that there be adequate funds with which to pay pensions if the company becomes
    insolvent and the plan is wound up.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The wind up of a pension plan is defined in the <i>PBA</i> as “the termination of the pension
    plan and the distribution of the assets of the pension fund” (s. 1(1)).  At the effective date of wind up, the plan
    members cease to accrue further entitlements under the plan.  Naturally, no new members may join the plan
    after the wind up date.  The pension fund
    of a plan that is wound up continues to be subject to the <i>PBA </i>and the Regulations until all of the assets of the fund have
    been disbursed (s. 76).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Winding up a pension plan must be distinguished from
    closing the plan, which simply means that no new entrants are permitted to join
    the plan.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the <i>PBA</i>,
    there are two ways that a pension plan can be wound up.  First, s. 68(1) recognizes that an employer<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> can voluntarily wind up the pension plan.  Second, under s. 69(1), in certain circumstances, the Superintendent may
    order the wind up of the plan.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>PBA </i>contains
    a detailed statutory scheme that must be followed when a pension plan is to be
    wound up.  This scheme imposes
    obligations on the employer and plan administrator, including the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The administrator has to give written notice of
    proposal to wind up to various people, including the Superintendent, and the
    notice must contain specified information (s. 68(2) and (4));</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A wind up date must be chosen and the administrator
    must file a wind up report showing, among other things, the plan’s assets and
    liabilities as at that date (s. 70(1));</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No payments can be made out of the pension fund until
    the Superintendent has approved the wind up report (s. 70(4));</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plan members with a certain combination of age and
    years of service or membership in the plan are entitled to additional benefits
    on wind up (grow-ins) (s. 74).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, s. 75 requires an employer to make two
    different categories of payment on plan wind up.  Sections 75(1)(a) and (b) read as follows:    </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Liability of
    employer on wind up</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>75.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<span class=GramE>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where</span> a pension plan is wound up in whole or in part, the employer shall pay into the

    employer to make all payments that are due immediately or that have accrued and
    not been paid into the pension fund.  Any
    unpaid current service costs and unpaid special payments are caught by this subsection.  In other words, by virtue of this subsection,
    any payments that the employer had to make while the plan was ongoing must be
    paid.  It will be recalled that while the
    plan was ongoing, some special payments could be made over time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 75(1)(b) requires the employer to pay additional

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be apparent that on wind up, an employer will
    often be faced with having to make significant additional contributions under
    s. 75(1)(b), in addition to being required to bring all contributions up to
    date because of s. 75(1)(a).  Section
    75(2) stipulates that “the employer shall pay the money due under subsection
    (1) in the prescribed manner and at the prescribed times.”  Section 31 of the Regulations prescribes the
    manner and timing for the s. 75 wind up payments.  It provides that the amounts an employer is
    to contribute under section 75 shall be by annual special payments, commencing
    at the effective date of the wind up, over not more than five years.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE <i>PBA </i>DEEMED
    TRUST </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    central issue in these appeals is whether the <i>CCAA </i>judge erred in his interpretation of s. 57(4) of the </span><i>PBA</i>.  Section 57(4) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>57.</b> (4)<span
class=GramE>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Where</b></span><b> a pension plan is wound up</b> in whole or

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modern approach to statutory construction dictates
    that in interpreting s. 57(4), the words must be read </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>in</span> their entire context
    and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
    Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    57(4) deems an employer to hold in trust an amount equal to the contributions “accrued
    to the date of wind up but not yet due under the plan or regulations”.  </span>The question is: what employer
    contributions are caught by s. 57(4) and, thus, are subject to the deemed trust?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The introductory words of s. 57(4) refer to where a
    pension plan is “wound up”.  Therefore,
    to answer this question, one must refer to the wind up regime created by the <i>PBA </i>and Regulations, a summary of which is
    set out above.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that when a pension plan is wound
    up, an actuarial calculation is made of the assets and liabilities, as of the
    wind up date.  Because the plan liabilities
    relate to service that was provided up to the wind up date and not beyond, it
    is clear that all plan liabilities are accrued as of the wind up date.  Put another way, no additional liability can
    accrue following the wind up because all events crystallize on the windup date
    – all pension benefit accruals by members cease and all amounts that an
    employer is required to pay into a pension plan are calculated as of the wind up
    date.  For the same reason, the amounts that
    s. 75 requires an employer to contribute to the pension fund, on wind up, are
    accrued to the date of wind up.  The
    required contributions are the amounts that an employer must make to the
    pension fund so that the accrued pension benefits of the plan members can be
    paid.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be further recalled that s. 31 of the
    Regulations gives the employer up to five years in which to make all of the required
    s. 75 contributions.  However, the fact
    that an employer is given time in which to pay the requisite contributions into
    the pension fund does not change the fact that the liabilities accrued by the
    wind up date.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This point is reinforced when one distinguishes amounts
    that are “accrued” from amounts that are “not yet due”.  In<i> Hydro-Electric Power Commission </i>(<i>Ontario</i>) <i>v. Albright</i> (1922), 64 S.C.R. 306, at
    para. 23, the Supreme Court of Canada explains that money is “due” when there
    is a legal obligation to pay it, whereas payments are “accrued” when the rights
    or obligations are constituted and the liability to pay exists, even if the
    payment does not need to be made until a later date (<i>i.e. </i>is not “due” until a later date).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, just as s. 57(4) contemplates, while the amounts
    that the employer must contribute to the pension fund pursuant to s. 75
    “accrued to the date of wind up”, because of s. 31 those contributions are “not
    yet due under the … regulations”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the wording of s. 57(4) to suggest
    that its scope is confined to the amounts payable under only s. 75(1)(a), as
    the respondents contend.   On the contrary, the words of s. 57(4), given
    their grammatical and ordinary meaning, contemplate that all amounts owing to
    the pension plan on wind up are subject to the deemed trust, even if those
    amounts are not yet due under the plan or regulations.  Therefore, the deemed trust in s. 57(4)
    applies to all employer contributions that are required to be made pursuant to s.
    75.  In short, the words “employer contributions
    accrued to the date of wind up but not yet due” in s. 57(4) include all amounts
    owed by the employer on the wind up of its pension plan.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This interpretation accords with a contextual analysis
    of s. 57(4).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As these appeals demonstrate, during the five-year
    “grace” period permitted by s. 31 of the Regulations, the rights of plan
    beneficiaries are at risk.  Sections
    57(4) and (5) provide some protection to the plan beneficiaries during that
    period.  The employees’ interest is in
    receiving their full pension entitlements.  For that to happen, all s. 75 employer contributions must be made into
    the pension fund.  The employer, on the
    other hand, has an interest in having a reasonable period of time within which
    to make the requisite s. 75 contributions.  Section 31 of the Regulations gives the employer up to five years to
    make the contributions, during which time the deemed trust in s. 57(4) and the
    lien and charge in s. 57(5) provide a measure of protection for the employees
    over the amount of the unpaid employer contributions, contributions that had <i>accrued </i>to the date of wind up <i>but [were] not yet due under the regulations</i>.                </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, this interpretation is consistent with the
    overall purpose of the <i>PBA</i>, which is
    to establish minimum standards,<a href="#_ftn5"

    at para. 38:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Act is public policy legislation that
    recognizes the vital importance of long-term income security.  As a legislative intervention in the
    administration of voluntary pension plans, its purpose is to establish minimum
    standards and regulatory supervision in order to protect and safeguard the
    pension benefits and rights of members, former members and others entitled to
    receive benefits under private pension plans (citations omitted).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much reference has been made to the two cases in which

    issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Factually, <span class=SpellE><i>Ivaco</i></span> and <span

    as a liquidation, transformed into a bankruptcy proceeding.  The case was focused primarily on whether
    there was a reason to defeat the bankruptcy petition.  In <span class=SpellE><i>Ivaco</i></span><i>, </i>Farley J.
    took a different view of the scope of the s. 57(4) deemed trust, stating that
    in a non-bankruptcy situation, the company’s assets were subject to a deemed
    trust on account of unpaid contributions and wind up liabilities.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span

'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  On appeal, although this court indicated that
    it thought that Farley J.’s statement in <span class=SpellE><i>Usarco</i></span><i> </i>was correct, it found it unnecessary to decide the matter.  Accordingly, these decisions are not determinative
    of the scope of the deemed trust created by s. 57(4) of the <i>PBA</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CCAA </i>judge
    concluded that because <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> had made the going-concern
    and special payments to the Salaried Plan at the date of closing, there were no
    amounts due to the Salaried Plan.  Therefore, there could be no deemed trust.  Respectfully, I disagree.  As I have explained, the deemed trust in s.
    57(4) is not limited to the payment of amounts contemplated by s. 75(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a).  It applies to
    all payments required by s. 75(1), including payments mandated by s. 75(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b).      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the deficiency in the Salaried Plan had
    accrued as of the date of wind up (December 31, 2006) and, pursuant to s. 57(4)
    of the <i>PBA</i>, was subject to a deemed
    trust.  The <i>CCAA </i>judge erred in holding that no deemed trust existed with
    respect to that deficiency as at July 20, 2009.  The consequences that flow from this conclusion are explored in the
    section below on how the Reserve Fund is to be distributed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are the unpaid liability payments owing to the
    Executive Plan also subject to the s. 57(4) deemed trust?  The Former Executives, Superintendent and <span
class=SpellE>Morneau</span> all contend that they are.  On the plain wording of s. 57(4), I find it
    difficult to accept this argument – the introductory words of the provision
    speak to “where a pension plan is wound up”.  In other words, wind up of the pension plan appears to be a requirement
    for s. 57(4) to apply.  If that is so, no
    deemed trust could arise unless and until a plan wind up occurred.      As
    has been noted, the Executive Plan had not been wound up at the relevant time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having said this, I am troubled by the notion that <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> can rely on its own inaction to avoid the
    consequences that flow from wind up.  In
    its letter of July 13, 2009, counsel for the Monitor confirmed that the
    Executive Plan would be wound up.  Indeed, the <i>CCAA </i>judge acknowledged that the material filed with the court
    showed an intention on the part of the Applicants to wind up the plan.  If the deemed trust does not extend to the
    Executive Plan, in the circumstances of this case, it appears that the result would
    be a triumph of form over substance.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, however, the question that drives these
    appeals is whether the Monitor should be directed to distribute the Reserve
    Fund to the Plans.  As I explain below in
    the section on how the Reserve Fund should be distributed, in my view, such an
    order should be made.  Consequently, it
    becomes unnecessary to decide whether the deemed trust applies to the
    deficiency in the Executive Plan and I decline to do so.  It is a question that is best decided in a
    case where the result depends on it and a fuller record would enable the court
    to appreciate the broader implications of such a determination.       </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Its
    role as employer permits it to make the decision to create a pension plan, to

    administrator for all purposes once a plan was established, of what use would a
    power of amendment be?  An employer could
    never use the power to amend the plan in a way that was to its benefit, as

lang=EN-US>The “two hats” analogy in <i>Imperial Oil </i>assists in understanding

    managing its business, wears its corporate hat.  Although the employer <i>qua </i>corporation
    must treat all stakeholders fairly when their interests conflict, the directors’
    ultimate duty is to act in the best interests of the corporation: see <i>BCE Inc. v. 1976 <span class=SpellE>Debentureholders</span></i>,

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[131]<span

lang=EN-US>I begin from the position that <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> had the right to make the decision to commence <i>CCAA </i>proceedings wearing solely its
    corporate hat.  That decision is not part
    of the administration of the pension plan or fund nor does it necessarily engage
    the rights of the beneficiaries of the pension plan.  For example, an employer might sell its
    business under <i>CCAA </i>protection, with
    the purchaser agreeing to continue the pension plan.  In that situation, there should be no effect
    on the payment of pension benefits.  Similarly, if the pension plan were fully funded, <i>CCAA </i>proceedings should have no effect on pension entitlements.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>However, just because the initial
    decision to commence <i>CCAA </i>proceedings
    is solely a corporate one that does not mean that all subsequent decisions made
    during the proceedings are also solely corporate ones.  In the circumstances of this case, <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> could not simply ignore its obligations as the
    Plans’ administrator once it decided to seek <i>CCAA </i>protection.  Shortly
    after initiating <i>CCAA </i>proceedings, <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> moved to obtain DIP financing, in which it agreed
    to give the DIP lenders a super-priority charge.  At the same time, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> knew that the Plans were underfunded and that unless more funds were put into
    the Plans, pensions would have to be reduced.  The decisions that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> was unilaterally
    making had the potential to affect the Plans beneficiaries’ rights, at a time
    when they were particularly vulnerable.  The
    peculiar vulnerability of pension plan beneficiaries was even greater than in
    the ordinary course because they were given no notice of the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings, had no real knowledge
    of what was transpiring and had no power to ensure that their interests were
    even considered – much less protected – during the DIP negotiations.     </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, it is significant that <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> is unclear as to what it thinks happened to its
    role as administrator during the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  When cross-examined on this matter, Mr.
    Cooper gave various responses as to whom he believed filled that role: <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span>, a combination of him and the Monitor, and a
    combination of him and his staff.  This
    confusion is understandable, given the number of roles that Mr. Cooper played in
    these proceedings.  It will be recalled that
    prior to the commencement of the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings,
    he became the Chief Restructuring Officer for <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S., a position which included responsibility for the Canadian group of <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> companies.  In
    this position, he served as <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> primary negotiator
    of the DIP credit agreement.  But, at the
    same time, he worked for FTI Consulting Inc.  The Monitor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FTI Consulting Inc.  This blending of roles no doubt contributed
    to the apparent disregard for the obligations owed by the Plans’
    administrator.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In any event, it is not apparent to
    me that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> could ignore its role as
    administrator or divest itself of those obligations without taking formal steps
    through the Superintendent, plan amendment, the courts, or some combination
    thereof, to transfer that role to a suitable person.  However, I will not consider this particular
    question further because it was not squarely raised and argued by the parties
    and, in any event, even if Mr. Cooper became the administrator, through his
    various roles, including as Chief Restructuring Officer for <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S., he is so clearly allied in interest with <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> that the following analysis remains applicable.     </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Second, the respondents’ submission
    that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> wore only its corporate hat during the
    proceedings is implicitly premised on the notion that an employer will wear its
    corporate hat or its administrator’s hat, but never both.  I do not accept this premise.  Nor do I accept that the reasoning in <i>Imperial Oil</i>, which the respondents rely
    on, supports this submission.       </span></p>

lang=EN-US>In <i>Imperial Oil</i>, the PCO had to decide whether certain acts taken in
    respect of a pension plan were those of the employer or the administrator.  Because the provision of pension plans is
    voluntary in Canada, the employer has the right to decide questions of plan design,
    including whether to offer a pension plan and, if it does, whether to end
    it.  In part because of the wording of s.
    14 of the <i>PBA </i>and in part because the
    amendments at issue in <i>Imperial Oil </i>were
    a matter of plan design, the PCO concluded that the employer was found to be
    acting solely in its corporate role when it passed the amendments.  There is nothing in <i>Imperial Oil </i>to suggest that an employer cannot find itself in a

    fund the deficit in the underfunded Plans.  It took no steps to protect the vested rights of the Plans’
    beneficiaries to continue to receive their full pension entitlements.  In fact, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> took
    active steps which undermined the possibility of additional funding to the
    Plans.  It applied for <i>CCAA</i> protection without notice to the
    Plans’ beneficiaries.  It obtained a <i>CCAA </i>order that gave priority to the DIP
    lenders over “statutory trusts” without notice to the Plans’ beneficiaries.  It sold its assets without making any
    provision for the Plans.  It knew the
    purchaser was not taking over the Plans.<a

    and distributing the sale proceeds to the DIP lenders, knowing that no payment would
    be made to the underfunded Plans.  And, <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. directed <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to
    bring its bankruptcy motion with the intention of defeating the deemed trust
    claims and </span>ensuring that the Reserve Fund was transferred to it.  In short, <span class=SpellE><span
style='color:black'>Indalex</span></span><span style='color:black'> did nothing
    to protect the best interests of the Plans’ beneficiaries and, accordingly, was
    in breach of its fiduciary obligations as administrator.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

class=SpellE><span lang=EN-US>Indalex</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> was in a conflict of interest position.  As has been mentioned, <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> corporate duty was to treat all stakeholders fairly when their interests
    conflicted, but its ultimate duty was to act in the best interests of the
    corporation.  <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> duty as administrator was to act in the Plans’ beneficiaries best interests.  It is apparent that in the circumstances of
    this case, these duties were in conflict.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    common law prohibition against conflict of interest is not confined to
    situations where the fiduciary’s personal interest conflicts with those of the
    beneficiaries.  It also precludes the
    fiduciary from placing itself in a position where it acts for two parties who
    are adverse in interest: <i>Davey v.
    Woolley, <span class=SpellE>Hames</span>, Dale &amp; <span class=SpellE>Dingwall</span> </i>(1982), 35 O.R. (2nd) 599 (C.A.), at para. 8.  In <i>Davey</i>,
    a solicitor who acted for both sides of a business transaction was found to be
    in breach of his fiduciary obligations.  Wilson J.A., writing for this court, explained that the conflict arose
    because the solicitor could not fulfill his duties in respect of both clients
    at the same time.  At para. 18, she
    concluded that the solicitor was bound to refuse to act for the plaintiff in
    the circumstances.        </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    prohibition against a fiduciary being in a position of conflicting duties
    governs the situation in which <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> found itself
    in during the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    its duties by simply ignoring its role as administrator.  A fiduciary relationship does not end simply
    because it becomes impossible of performance.  At the point where its duty to the corporation conflicted with its
    duties as administrator, it was incumbent on <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to take steps to address the conflict.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even
    if I am in error in concluding that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> was in
    breach of its common law fiduciary obligations, I would find that its actions amounted
    to a breach of s. 22(4) of the <i>PBA</i>.  Section 22(4) prohibits an administrator from
    knowingly permitting its interest to conflict with its duties and powers in
    respect of the pension fund.  Under s.
    57(5) of the <i>PBA</i>, as administrator, <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> had a lien and charge on its assets for the amount
    of the deemed trust.  Any steps that it
    might have taken pursuant to s. 57(5), as administrator, would have been in
    respect of the pension fund.  Thus, if nothing
    else, <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> actions during the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings demonstrate that it
    permitted its corporate interests to conflict with the administrator’s duties
    and powers that flow from the lien and charge.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    found that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> breached its fiduciary obligations
    to the Plans’ beneficiaries, the question becomes: what flows from such a
    finding?  I address that question below
    when considering the issue of how to distribute the Reserve Fund.  At that time I will return to the arguments
    of the Monitor and Sun <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to the effect that
    such a finding is largely irrelevant in these proceedings.     <span> </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DOES THE COLLATERAL ATTACK RULE BAR THE DEEMED TRUST
    MOTIONS?</span><i></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    U.S. Trustee submits that even if the <i>PBA </i>creates a deemed trust for any wind up deficiencies in the Plans, the
    appeals should be dismissed because the underlying motions are an impermissible
    collateral attack on previous orders made in the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  His
    argument runs as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The Initial Order, the June 12, 2009
    order and the Sale Approval order (the “Court Orders”) are all valid, enforceable
    court orders.  The Court Orders gave
    super-priority <span class=GramE>rights to the DIP lenders and <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. is</span> subrogated to those rights.  None of the Court Orders were appealed and no
    party sought to have them set aside or varied.  As the appellants’ motions seek to alter the priorities established by
    the Court Orders, they should be barred because they are an impermissible
    collateral attack on those orders.         </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission for three reasons, the
    first two of which can be shortly stated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, this submission is an attack on the underlying motions.  As such, it ought to have been raised below.  The Former Executives say that the collateral
    attack doctrine was raised for the first time on appeal.  Certainly, if it was raised below, the <i>CCAA </i>judge makes no reference to
    it.  As a general rule, it is not
    appropriate to raise an issue for the first time on appeal.  The exceptions to this general rule are very
    limited and do not apply in this case: see <i>Cusson </i>v. <span class=SpellE><i>Quan</i></span>,
    [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712, at paras. 36-37.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the USW and the Former Executives raised the
    matter of the deemed trusts in the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  The <i>CCAA </i>judge designed a process by which their claims would be resolved.  They followed that process.  The USW and Former Executives can scarcely be
    faulted for complying with a court-designed process.  Further, the Sale Approval order acknowledged
    the deemed trust issue in that it required the Monitor to hold funds in reserve
    that were sufficient to satisfy the deemed trust claims. That acknowledgment is
    inconsistent with a subsequent claim of impermissible collateral attack.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, as I will now explain, an appreciation of the <i>CCAA </i>regime makes it apparent that the
    collateral attack rule does not apply in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The collateral attack rule rests on the need for court
    orders to be treated as binding and conclusive unless they are set aside on
    appeal or lawfully quashed.  Court orders
    may not be attacked collaterally.  That
    is, a court order may not be attacked in proceedings other than those whose
    specific object is the reversal, variation, or nullification of the order.  See <i>Wilson
    v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, at para. 8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The fundamental policy behind the
    rule against collateral attacks is “to maintain the rule of law and to preserve
    the repute of the administration of justice”: see <i>R. v. Litchfield</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333, at para. 22.  If a party could avoid the consequences of an
    order issued against it by going to another forum, this would undermine the
    integrity of the justice system.  Consequently, the doctrine is intended to prevent a party from
    circumventing the effect of a decision rendered against it: see <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co</i>., [2004] 1
    S.C.R. 629, at para. 72. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CCAA</i> regime is designed to deal with all matters during an insolvent company’s
    attempt to reorganize.  The court-ordered
    stay of proceedings ensures that there is only one forum where parties can put
    forth their arguments and claims.  By pre-empting
    other legal proceedings, the stay gives a corporation breathing space, which promotes
    the opportunity for reorganization.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CCAA</i> regime
    is a flexible, judicially supervised reorganization process that allows for
    creative and effective decisions: see <i>Century
    Services Ltd. </i>v. <i>Canada </i>(<i>Attorney General</i>), [2010] 3 S.C.R. 379,
    at para. 21.  The <i>CCAA </i>judge is accorded broad discretion because the proceedings are
    a fact-based exercise that requires ongoing monitoring and because there is
    often a need for the court to act quickly.  There is an underlying assumption, however, that the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings will provide an
    opportunity for affected persons to participate in the proceedings.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This assumption finds voice in para. 56 of the Initial
    Order, as amended, which permits any interested party to apply to the <i>CCAA </i>court to vary or amend the Initial
    Order (the come-back clause).  That is
    precisely what the appellants did.  As interested
    parties, they went to the <i>CCAA </i>court
    to ask that the super-priority charge be varied or amended so that their claims
    could be properly recognised.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I do not accept that the appellants failed to
    act promptly in asserting their claims.  It
    was only when <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> brought a motion for approval
    of the sale of its assets to SAPA and for a distribution of the sale proceeds
    to the DIP lenders that it became clear that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> intended to abandon the Plans in their underfunded states.  The appellants immediately took steps to
    assert their claims in the very forum in which all of the Court Orders had been
    made, namely, the <i>CCAA </i>court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The U.S. Trustee’s argument that the Court Orders were
    never appealed is not persuasive.  In <i>Algoma Steel Inc. Re </i>(2001), 147 O.A.C.
    291, at paras. 7-9, this court stated that it is premature to grant leave to
    appeal from an initial order – brought on an urgent basis to deal with
    seemingly desperate circumstances – when the order specifically opens the
    proceeding to all interested parties and invites dissatisfied parties to bring
    their concerns to the court on a timely basis using a come-back provision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Former Executives point out, had the appellants sought
    to advance their deemed trust claims by bringing a motion challenging the paragraph
    of the Initial Order that established the DIP super-priority charge, it is
    likely that they would have been met by a response that their motions were
    premature.  Depending on the amount paid
    for the company and/or the arrangements made in respect of the Plans, the
    interests of the Plans’ beneficiaries might not have been affected by a sale.  Indeed, on July 2, 2009, when <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> brought a motion to have the bidding procedures
    approved for the asset sale and the Former Executives objected because of concerns
    that the Plans were underfunded, the <i>CCAA</i> judge endorsed the record as follows: “The issues can be raised by the retirees
    on any application to approve a transaction – but that is for another
    day.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants followed that direction.  When <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> moved
    to have the sale transaction approved and the jeopardy to the appellants’
    interests became apparent, they went to the <i>CCAA </i>court and raised the deemed trust issue.<a
href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[15]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, as I have said, I do not view the deemed trust
    motions as collateral attacks on the Court Orders.  The motions were raised in a timely manner in
    the same court in which the orders were made.  They can scarcely be termed attempts to circumvent decisions rendered
    against the USW and the Former Executives when no decision had ever been
    rendered in which their claims had been squarely raised and addressed.  The process the USW and the Former Executives
    followed is exactly that which is contemplated in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings and, specifically, the come-back clause.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the collateral attack rule were applicable, however,
    this is not a case for its strict application.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Litchfield</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that there will be situations in which
    the collateral attack rule should not be strictly applied.  In that case, a physician had been charged
    with a number of counts of sexual assault on his patients.  On motion, a judge (not the trial judge)
    ordered that the counts be severed and divided and three different trials be
    held.  After one trial, the physician was
    acquitted.  The Crown appealed.  One of the grounds of appeal related to the
    pre-trial severance order.  The question
    arose as to whether the Crown’s challenge to the validity of the severance order
    violated the collateral attack rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At paras. 16-19 of <i>Litchfield</i>,
    Iacobucci J., writing for the majority, explains that “some flexibility” is
    needed in the application of the rule against collateral attacks.  Strictly applied, the rule would prevent the
    trial judge from reviewing the severance order because the trial was not a
    proceeding whose specific object was the reversal, variation or nullification
    of the severance order.  However, Iacobucci
    J. noted, the rule is not intended to immunize court orders from review.  He reiterated the powerful rationale behind
    the rule: to maintain the rule of law and preserve the repute of the
    administration of justice.  This promotes
    certainty and finality, key aspects of the orderly and functional
    administration of justice.  However, he
    concluded that flexibility was warranted because permitting a collateral attack
    on the severance order did not offend the underlying rationale for the rule.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in<i> R.
    v. <span class=SpellE>Domm</span></i> (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 540, at para. 31, Doherty
    J.A., writing for this court, states that if a collateral attack can be taken
    without harm to the interests of the rule of law and the repute of the
    administration of justice, the rule should be relaxed.  At para. 36 of <span class=SpellE><i>Domm</i></span>, he says that the rule must
    yield where a person has “no other effective means” of challenging the order in
    question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that certainty and finality are necessary
    to the proper functioning of the legal system.  And, I recognize that permitting the appellants’ motions to proceed has generated
    some degree of uncertainty as to the priorities established by the Court
    Orders.  However, in the circumstances of
    this case, there was no other effective means by which the appellants could assert
    their claims to a deemed trust.  As has
    been mentioned, it was only when <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> brought a
    motion for approval of the sale of its assets to SAPA and for a distribution of
    the sale proceeds to the DIP lenders that it became clear that <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> intended to abandon the Plans in their underfunded
    states.  The appellants immediately took
    steps to assert their claims in the very forum in which all of the Court Orders
    had been made, namely, the <i>CCAA </i>court.  By permitting their motions to be heard, the <i>CCAA </i>judge did not damage the repute of
    the administration of justice.  On the
    contrary, he strengthened it.  He enabled
    the sale to proceed while ensuring that the competing claims to the Reserve Fund
    would be decided on the merits and expeditiously. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor can it be said, for the reasons already given about
    the nature of <i>CCAA </i>proceedings, that
    the deemed trust motions jeopardize the rule of law.  Given the nature of a <i>CCAA</i> proceeding, the court must often make orders on an urgent and
    expedited basis, with little or no notice to creditors and other interested
    parties.  Its processes are sufficiently
    flexible that it can accommodate situations such as the one that arose here.  A strict application of the rule would preclude
    the appellants from having the opportunity to meaningfully challenge the
    super-priority charge in the Initial Order, as amended.  In my view, that result would be a
    fundamental flaw in the <i>CCAA </i>process,
    one in which procedure triumphed over substance.  As Iacobucci J. said in <i>Litchfield</i>, at para. 18, such a result cannot be accepted.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in my view, while the collateral attack
    rule does not apply, even if it did, there are compelling reasons in this case to
    relax its strict application.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DO THE PRINCIPLES OF CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCIES APPLY? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    U.S. Trustee also submits that the principles of cross-border insolvencies
    should be applied when deciding these appeals.  He contends that n<span class=SpellE><span lang=EN-US>otwithstanding</span></span><span lang=EN-US> that separate proceedings were commenced in Canada and the U.S., those
    principles apply because the Applicants were direct and indirect subsidiaries
    of certain of the U.S. debtors, who commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of
    Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in March 2009.  Further, the U.S. Trustee contends that </span>if
    the appellants’ claims were to succeed, it would seriously undermine <span
lang=EN-US>the basic principles underlying
    cross-border insolvencies and the confidence of foreign creditors and courts in
    the Canadian insolvency system.     </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While this argument provides context
    for the U.S. Trustee’s collateral attack submission, I do not see it as
    disclosing any legal grounds relevant to these appeals.  By order dated May 12, 2009, Morawetz J.
    approved a cross-border protocol in these proceedings that stipulates that the
    U.S. and Canadian courts retain exclusive jurisdiction over the proceedings in
    their respective jurisdictions.  Furthermore,
    there is no evidence to support the U.S. Trustee’s claim that allowing these
    appeals would impair future lending practices by U.S. companies.  Finally, nothing has been raised which
    supports the notion that upholding valid provincial law in the circumstances of
    these appeals will undermine the principles of cross-border insolvencies.    </span></p>

    effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents argue that the super-priority charge
    has priority over any deemed trusts and, therefore, the Reserve Fund should be
    paid to Sun <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span>, as the principal secured
    creditor of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S.  They point to well-established law that
    authorizes the court to grant super-priority to DIP lenders in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings and argue that without such
    a charge, DIP lenders will no longer provide financing to companies under <i>CCAA </i>protection.  Without DIP funding they say, many companies
    under <i>CCAA </i>protection will be unable
    to continue in business until a compromise or arrangement has been worked out.  Consequently, companies will file for
    bankruptcy where deemed trusts have no priority.  This, they say, will frustrate the very
    purpose of the <i>CCAA</i>, which is to
    facilitate the making of compromises or arrangements between insolvent debtor

'>[16]</span></span></span></a>  I fully accept that the <i>CCAA </i>judge can make an order granting a super-priority charge that
    has the effect of overriding provincial legislation, including the <i>PBA</i>.  I also accept that without such a charge, DIP lenders may be unwilling
    to provide financing to companies under <i>CCAA </i>protection.  However, this does not
    mean that the super-priority charge in question has the effect of overriding
    the deemed trust.  To decide whether it
    does, one must turn to the doctrine of <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Valid provincial laws continue to apply in federally
    regulated bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings absent an express finding of federal <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span>.  The
    onus is on the party relying on the doctrine of <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> to demonstrate that the federal and provincial laws are incompatible by
    establishing either that it is impossible to comply with both laws or that to
    apply the provincial law would frustrate the purpose of the federal law: see <i>Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta</i>, [2007]
    2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 75 and <i>Nortel
    Networks Corp. (Re)</i> (2009), 99 O.R. (3d) 708 (C.A.), at para. <span
class=GramE>38,</span> leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2009] S.C.C.A. No.
    531.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there is nothing in the record to suggest
    that the issue of <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> was invoked on April 8,
    2009, when Morawetz J. amended the Initial Order to include the super-priority
    charge.  The documents before the court at
    that time did not alert the court to the issue or suggest that the <i>PBA </i>deemed trust would have to be
    overridden in order for <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to proceed with its
    DIP financing efforts while under <i>CCAA </i>protection.  To the contrary, the affidavit of Timothy
    Stubbs, the then CEO of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span>, sworn April 3, 2009,
    was the primary source of information before the court.  In para. 74 of his affidavit, Mr. Stubbs
    deposes that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> intended to comply with all
    applicable laws including “regulatory deemed trust requirements”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the super-priority charge provides that it ranks
    in priority over trusts, “statutory or otherwise”, I do not read it as taking
    priority over the deemed trust in this case because the deemed trust was not
    identified by the court at the time the charge was granted and the affidavit
    evidence suggested such a priority was unnecessary.  As no finding of <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> was made, valid provincial laws continue to operate: the super-priority charge
    does not override the <i>PBA</i> deemed
    trust.  The two operate sequentially,
    with the deemed trust being satisfied first from the Reserve Fund.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does this conclusion thwart the purpose of the <i>CCAA</i> regime, which is to facilitate the
    restructuring of failing businesses to avoid bankruptcy and liquidation?  It does not appear that would have happened
    in the present case.  The granting of a
    stay in a <i>CCAA </i>proceeding provides a
    company with breathing space so that it can restructure.  In this case, the stay of proceedings gave <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> the breathing space it needed to <span class=GramE>effect</span> a sale of its business.  Recall that t<span
lang=EN-US>his was a “liquidating CCAA” from
    the outset. There was no restructuring of the company.  There was no plan of compromise or
    arrangement prepared and presented to creditors.  Within days of obtaining <i>CCAA</i> protection, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> began a
    marketing process to sell itself.  Very
    shortly thereafter, it </span>sold its business as a going-concern.  There is nothing in the record to suggest
    that giving the deemed trust priority would have frustrated <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> efforts to sell itself as a going-concern business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> What of the
    contention that recognition of the deemed trust will cause DIP lenders to be
    unwilling to advance funds in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings?  It is important to recognize that the conclusion
    I have reached does not mean that a finding of <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> will never be made.  That determination must
    be made on a case by case basis.  There
    may well be situations in which <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> is invoked
    and the record satisfies the <i>CCAA </i>judge
    that application of the provincial legislation would frustrate the company’s
    ability to restructure and avoid bankruptcy.  But, this depends on the applicant clearly raising the issue of <span
class=SpellE>paramountcy</span>, which will alert affected parties to the risks
    to their interests and put them in a position where they can take steps to
    protect their rights.  That, however, is
    not this case.              </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor am I persuaded by the argument that if the deemed
    trust is given effect in the unique circumstances of this <span class=GramE>case,</span> companies will file for bankruptcy instead of moving for <i>CCAA </i>protection.  This
    argument suggests that companies will act based on the desire to avoid their
    pension obligations.  That motivation
    does not conform with the obligations that directors owe to the corporation.  The obligation to act in the best interests
    of the corporation suggests that companies will choose the route that maximizes
    recovery for creditors.  As the
    respondents point out, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> sought a going-concern
    sale for exactly that reason.  In
    addition, by selling its business as a going concern, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> preserved value for suppliers and customers who can continue to do business
    with the purchaser and preserved approximately 950 jobs for its former
    employees.  Surely the desire to maximize
    recovery for their creditors – along with those other considerations – would have
    prevailed had <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> known it would have to satisfy the
    deemed trust when considering whether to pursue bankruptcy or <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  In this regard, it is worth recalling that
    consideration for the sale exceeded $151 million, all DIP lenders were repaid
    in full, the Reserve Fund consists of undistributed proceeds, and the total
    deficiencies in the Plans appear to be approximately $6.75 million.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the suggestion that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> will pursue its bankruptcy motion in order to defeat the deemed trust, I would
    simply echo the comments of the <i>CCAA </i>judge
    that a voluntary assignment into bankruptcy should not be used to defeat a
    secured claim under valid provincial legislation.  I would add this additional
    consideration:  it is inappropriate for a <i>CCAA </i>applicant with a fiduciary duty
    to pension plan beneficiaries to seek to avoid those obligations to the benefit
    of a related party by invoking bankruptcy proceedings when no other creditor
    seeks to do so.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is also the matter of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S.’s apparent reliance on the super-priority charge when it gave the
    Guarantee.  As explained more fully
    above, <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. was fully aware of <span
class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> obligations to the Plans when it entered into the
    Guarantee.  Again as explained more fully
    above, there were a number of different steps that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> could have taken to deal with these obligations.  It chose not to.  This is not a case in which the secured
    creditor is an arm’s length third party taken by surprise by the claims of the
    Plans’ beneficiaries.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A final consideration that must be addressed at this
    stage arises from the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Century Services</i>, which was released after
    the oral hearing of the appeals.  The
    parties were invited to make written submissions on the impact of <i>Century Services</i>, if any, on these
    appeals.  I am grateful for the
    excellence of those submissions, which mirrors the quality of the original
    submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Century Services </i>deals
    with conflicting provisions in two pieces of federal legislation:  s. 222(3) of the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, which gives the federal Crown
    a deemed trust for unpaid GST, and s. 18.3(1) (now s. 37) of the <i>CCAA</i>, which expressly excludes deemed
    trusts in favour of the Crown from applying in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  Deschamps
    J., for the majority, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the two conflicting
    sections and held that s. 18.3(1) of the <i>CCAA </i>prevails.  In sum, <i>Century Services </i>stands for the
    proposition that s. 18.3(1) of the <i>CCAA </i>excludes
    the deemed trust for unpaid GST created by s. 222 of the <i>Excise Tax Act </i>from applying in a <i>CCAA </i>proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be readily apparent that <i>Century Services </i>is distinguishable from the present case in a
    number of ways.  Three significant
    differences between it and the present appeals are worthy of note.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in <i>Century
    Services</i>, reorganization efforts had failed and the company sought leave to
    make an assignment into bankruptcy.  Liquidation on a piecemeal basis through bankruptcy was inevitable.  The <i>CCAA </i>proceedings in the present case, on the other hand, were successful – they resulted
    in the sale of <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> assets and the continuation
    of the business, albeit through another entity.  It is not a situation in which transition to the bankruptcy regime was
    inevitable because efforts under the <i>CCAA </i>had failed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, <i>Century
    Services</i> deals with competing provisions in two federal statutes.  The conflict between the two provisions was
    patent:  one or the other had to prevail.  They could not be read together.  Section 18.3(1) was found to prevail, in part
    because of its wording, which expressly excludes a deemed trust in favour of
    the Crown.  The present appeals involve a
    consideration of the doctrine of federal <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> and whether a deemed trust under provincial legislation applies to a charge
    granted in a <i>CCAA </i>proceeding.  Significantly, unlike the situation in <i>Century Services, </i>there is nothing in
    the <i>CCAA </i>that expressly excludes the
    provincial deemed trust for unpaid pension contributions from applying in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  In these appeals, exclusion of the provincial
    deemed trust is dependent on the <i>CCAA </i>judge
    engaging in a factual examination and a determination that preservation of
    pension rights through the deemed trust would frustrate the purpose of the <i>CCAA </i>proceeding.  Moreover, it is difficult to see how a
    finding of <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> would have been made on the
    record at the time the super-priority charge was made, given the evidence that <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> intended to comply with all regulatory deemed trust
    requirements.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"

'>[17]</span></span></span></a>      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, no issue of fiduciary duty arose in <i>Century Services</i>.  In the present case, as discussed previously
    and again below, the impact of fiduciary duties during the <i>CCAA </i>proceeding plays a significant role.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents contend that <i>Century Services </i>is crucial in the disposition of these appeals because
    it stands for the proposition that federal priorities under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. B-3 (<i>BIA</i>) apply in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.  If <i>Century
    Services </i>stood for that proposition, I would agree.  In a series of cases, the Supreme Court of
    Canada has repeatedly said that a province cannot, by legislating a deemed
    trust, alter the scheme of priorities under the <i>BIA</i>: see, for example, <i>British
    Columbia v. <span class=SpellE>Henfrey</span> Samson <span class=SpellE>Belair</span> Ltd</i>., [1989] 2 S.C.R. 24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  However, in my
    view, <i>Century Services </i>does not stand
    for that unqualified proposition.  In <i>Century Services</i>, Deschamps J. explains that
    the <i>CCAA </i>and <i>BIA</i> are to be read in an integrated fashion but she is at pains to
    say that the <i>BIA </i>scheme of
    liquidation and distribution is the backdrop for what happens <i>if <span class=GramE>a CCAA</span> reorganization is unsuccessful</i>.<a
href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[18]</span></span></span></a>  Here, as I have noted, the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings were successful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Deschamps J. repeatedly distinguishes the two
    regimes on the basis that the <i>BIA </i>is
    “characterized by a rules-based approach”<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[19]</span></span></span></a> whereas the <i>CCAA “</i>offers a more
    flexible mechanism with greater judicial discretion”.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[20]</span></span></span></a>  Permitting the <i>PBA </i>deemed trust to survive, absent an express finding of <span
class=SpellE>paramountcy</span>, is consistent with both those key features of
    the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings – greater
    flexibility and greater judicial discretion on the part of the <i>CCAA </i>court.  This flexibility and discretion on the part
    of the <i>CCAA </i>court enables it to
    meaningfully assess the baseline considerations of appropriateness, good faith
    and due diligence, referred to by Deschamps J. at para. 70 of <i>Century Services</i>.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[194]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The respondents point to paras. 47,
    48 and 76 of <i>Century Services</i>, in
    which Deschamps J. notes the “strange asymmetry” that would occur if the <i>ETA </i>Crown priority were interpreted
    differently in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings than
    in <i>BIA </i>proceedings.  She says this would encourage forum shopping
    in cases where the debtor’s assets cannot satisfy both the secured creditors’
    and the Crown’s claims.  No “strange
    asymmetry” would occur in cases such as the present appeals.  If the <i>CCAA </i>judge found that recognition of the <i>PBA </i>deemed trust would frustrate the purpose of the <i>CCAA </i>proceeding and <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span> had been
    invoked, the <i>CCAA </i>judge would be free
    to make a super-priority charge that overrode the deemed trust.  This approach leaves the <i>CCAA </i>court with greater flexibility and the ability to be
    “cognizant of the various interests at stake in the reorganization, which can
    extend beyond those of the debtor and creditors to include employees”.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span

lang=EN-US>In para. 70 of her reasons,
    Deschamps J. <span class=GramE>exhorts</span> the <i>CCAA </i>courts to be “mindful that chances for successful
    reorganizations are enhanced where participants achieve common ground and <i>all stakeholders are treated as
    advantageously and fairly as the circumstances permit</i>” [emphasis added].  The Plans’ beneficiaries are
    stakeholders.  And, once the deemed trust
    claims are recognized, they are not to be treated as mere unsecured
    creditors.  If, as the respondents
    contend based on <i>Century Services</i>,
    the deemed trusts are automatically overridden, there will be no incentive for
    companies that are similarly situated to <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to
    attempt to deal with their underfunded pension plans.  There will be no incentive to treat pension
    plan beneficiaries “as advantageously and fairly as the circumstances permit”.  The incentive will be to do as <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> did – go to court without notice to the affected
    pension plan beneficiaries and negotiate as if the pension obligations did not
    exist.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[196]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Justice Deschamps also says that no
    “gap” should exist between the <i>BIA </i>and
    the <i>  CCAA</i> and approves of Laskin J.A.’s
    reasoning to that effect at paras. 62-63 of <span class=SpellE><i>Ivaco</i></span>.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span

'>[22]</span></span></span></a>  She explains that the gap is a situation
    “which would allow the enforcement of property interests at the conclusion of <i>CCAA </i>proceedings that would be lost in
    bankruptcy”.  When the facts of the
    present case are considered carefully, it can be seen that a gap of this sort
    will not occur should the appeals be allowed.  As I see it, the deemed trusts continued to exist during the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings although no steps could
    be taken to enforce them during the proceedings because of the stay.  By the time of the Sale Approval Order, the <i>CCAA </i>court had become aware of the
    deemed trust claims.  It dealt with the
    deemed trust claims as part of the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings,
    by deciding whether the undistributed sales proceeds held by the Monitor should
    go to <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. or to the Plans’ beneficiaries.  Thus, rather than being a situation in which
    property interests that would be lost in bankruptcy were enforced at the conclusion
    of the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings, the property
    interests were dealt with as part of the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings.        </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[197]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    even if I am wrong in concluding that the deemed trust has priority over the
    secured creditor in this case, I would make the order on the basis that it is
    the appropriate remedy for the breaches of fiduciary obligation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[198]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to keep in mind that the contest over the Reserve Fund is not a
    fight between the DIP lenders and the pensioners.  The DIP lenders have been paid in full.  The dispute is between the pensioners and Sun <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span>, the principal secured creditor of <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S.  It is
    in that context that the court must consider the competing equities.   </p>

lang=EN-US>The <i>CCAA </i>was not designed to allow a company to avoid its pension
    obligations.  To give effect to <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S.’s claim would be to sanction <span
class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> breaches of fiduciary obligation.  In the circumstances of this case, such a
    result would work an injustice.  The
    equities are not equal.  The Plans’
    beneficiaries were vulnerable to the exercise of power by <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span>.  They were not part of the negotiations for
    the DIP financing nor were they involved in the sale negotiations.  They had no opportunity to protect their
    interests and, as a result of <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> actions,
    there was no one who fulfilled the administrator’s role.  <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span>, on the
    other hand, was fully aware of the Plans’ underfunding and the result to the
    pensioners of a failure to inject additional funds.  It was <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> who
    advised the <i>CCAA </i>court that it
    intended to comply with “regulatory deemed trust requirements”.  To permit Sun <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> to recover on behalf of <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. would be to
    effectively permit the party who breached its fiduciary obligations to take the

    do not accept the respondents’ argument that a finding that <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> breached its fiduciary obligation is irrelevant because it would merely give
    rise to an unsecured claim and there is no basis for conferring a priority for
    such a claim.  This view fundamentally
    misunderstands the rights of the pension plan beneficiaries.  Even if there is no deemed trust, the Plans’
    beneficiaries are not mere unsecured creditors.  They are unsecured creditors to whom <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> owed a fiduciary duty by virtue of its role as the Plans’ administrator.  There is a significant difference, in my

lang=EN-US>As I have already explained, in the
    circumstances of this case, <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> fiduciary
    obligations as administrator were engaged in relation to the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings and it is those proceedings
    that gave rise to the asset (<i>i.e. </i>the
    Reserve Fund) (condition 1).  The assets
    that would flow to <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S., absent the
    constructive trust, are directly connected to the process in which <span
class=SpellE>Indalex</span> committed its breaches of fiduciary obligation
    (condition 2).  Without the proprietary
    remedy, the Plans’ beneficiaries have no meaningful remedy.  Moreover, there must be some incentive to
    require employers who are also the administrators of their pension plans to
    remain faithful to their duties (condition 3).  And, because <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S. is not an arm’s
    length innocent third party, imposing a constructive trust in favour of the
    Plans’ beneficiaries is not unjust (condition 4).    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>            <b><i>The Executive Plan</i></b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[205]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As I explained above, it is not
    clear to me that a deemed trust arose in respect of the underfunded amounts in the
    Executive Plan because it had not been wound up at the time of sale.  However, based on the breaches of fiduciary
    duty, the court is entitled to consider the equities of the parties competing
    for the Reserve Fund.  For the reasons
    given in respect of the Salaried Plan in respect of those equities, I would
    make the same order in respect of the Executive Plan, namely, that the Monitor
    pay the deficiency from the Reserve Fund to the Executive Plan in priority to
    those entitled under the super-priority charge.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[206]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In light of this conclusion, I find
    it unnecessary to deal with the Former Executives’ submission that the doctrine
    of equitable subordination applies to remedy <span class=SpellE>Indalex’s</span> breaches of fiduciary duty.  In any
    event, I would decline to decide that issue as it was not argued below. It
    offends the general rule that appellate courts are not to entertain new issues
    on appeal.</span>  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[207]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I would allow the

    priority over the claim asserted by <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span> U.S<span
class=GramE>./</span>Sun <span class=SpellE>Indalex</span>.  I would order the Monitor to pay from the
    Reserve Fund into each of the Salaried Plan and the Executive Plan an amount
    sufficient to satisfy the deficiencies in each plan.  I understand that the Reserve Fund is
    sufficient to satisfy the Deficiencies but if this proves problematic, the
    parties may return to the court for direction on that matter.  </span></p>
