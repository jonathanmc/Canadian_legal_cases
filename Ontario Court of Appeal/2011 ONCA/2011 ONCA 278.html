  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant stood trial on an information that
    charged him with sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching and sexual
    assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial took place on a single day, December 2, 2008.
    There were two witnesses, the complainant, aged 15, and the appellant, aged 19.
    Their testimony centered on sexual activities the complainant alleged took
    place between the two boys, next-door neighbours, for several years when the
    complainant was about 10 to 13 years old and the appellant was about 14 to 17
    years old.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rendered her decision at the conclusion
    of the trial. She convicted the appellant on all three charges. He appeals his
    conviction. He abandoned his sentence appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge did not
    properly apply the criminal standard of proof in this case. Crucial components
    of this failure, asserts the appellant, were the trial judge’s treatment and
    non-treatment of serious inconsistencies between the complainant’s statement to
    the police and his testimony at the trial, her reasoning and lack thereof with
    respect to her rejection of the appellant’s testimony, and her formulation of
    her ultimate conclusion that the Crown had proved the case against the
    appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We admire the trial judge’s attempt to provide the
    parties with a comprehensive oral judgment at the end of a long trial day. We
    also recognize that an appellate court must be careful not to scrutinize too
    critically the oral reasons of a judge working in a busy trial court,
    especially when those reasons are anchored, at bottom, in her assessment of the
    credibility of only two witnesses, a youthful complainant and a youthful
    accused <span class=GramE>who</span> chose to testify in his defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in the end we accept the appellant’s
    submissions on this appeal. The trial judge’s reasons, read as a whole, do not
    satisfy us that she properly applied the criminal standard of proof in this
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acknowledged that there were
    inconsistencies between the complainant’s police statement and his trial
    testimony. The complainant told the police that the sexual activities occurred 7
    or 8 or 25 or 30 times. He testified that they took place every time the boys
    met, hundreds of times. In his testimony, he acknowledged that these
    descriptions were “vastly different”. The complainant conceded in his testimony
    that “yeah, that’s another guess”. He said that the sexual activity both <i>always</i> and <i>never</i> occurred when the appellant was babysitting him.
    Unfortunately, the trial judge ignored many significant inconsistencies or
    stated them baldly without addressing their impact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also appeared to treat the appellant’s
    testimony (we emphasize that both the complainant and the appellant were young
    people) quite critically. She said that he made cross-examination difficult
    because he asserted a blanket denial of all the alleged incidents. She stated,
    improperly, that the appellant “could not give any reason why the complainant
    would have wanted to tell stories about him.” She tended to inflate the
    appellant’s age and reduce the complainant’s age throughout her reasons,
    thereby creating an inaccurate age differential between the two boys.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, and most importantly, the trial judge’s
    statement of her ultimate conclusion is, with respect, problematic. The trial
    judge was unable to find that any specific incident of abuse – relating to
    date, location or activity – actually took place. Moreover,  near the end of her reasons, she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find myself in the position of not believing that
    the events – that is to say that the events vis-à-vis their frequency,
    vis-à-vis the exact details of the events, vis-à-vis always the exact location
    and the timing of the events – I find myself unable to make a finding that Mr.
    M. was accurate with respect to that. Having said that, however, I am not in a
    position of rejecting the evidence of Mr. M. when he says to me that there were
    sexual occurrences between him and Mr. <span class=GramE>J..</span> And, I am
    not in a position of rejecting that those occurrences were on an ongoing basis.
    And, I am not in a position of rejecting that those occurrences included being
    touched by Mr. J., being invited by Mr. J. to touch Mr. J. and being
    sexually assaulted by Mr. J., i.e. <span class=SpellE>sodomization</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This combination of a fairly sweeping rejection of the
    complainant’s evidence relating to important components of the alleged sexual
    activities and an almost half-hearted reliance on the residue of his testimony
    are not, in our view, sufficient to ground a conviction on the criminal
    standard of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed, the convictions are set aside,
    and a new trial is ordered.</p>
