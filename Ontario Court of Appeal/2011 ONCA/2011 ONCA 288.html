    is an identification case.  It involves two
    assaults that <span class=GramE>occurred</span> late one evening in, and just
    outside of, a crowded bar.  Crown
    witnesses pointed out the appellant as the perpetrator.  The appellant denied this, identified another
    person, named Mary San, as the one who committed the assaults, and called
    evidence to support her position.  The
    trial judge rejected the defence evidence and concluded that the Crown had
    proved that the appellant had committed both assaults.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    appellant was convicted of assault and assault with a weapon and sentenced to six
    months in custody.   </span></p>

    the trial judge did not see a videotape of the appellant’s booking at the
    police station on the night of the altercations.  The appellant appeared in the videotape
    dressed as she had been at the time of the fight in the bar.  Her appearance in the videotape was
    consistent with her trial testimony describing what she was wearing that night and
    was, in at least one material aspect, inconsistent with the testimony of a key
    Crown identification witness.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>On
    appeal to the summary conviction appeal court, the appellant sought to
    introduce the videotape as fresh evidence.  The Crown conceded that defence counsel at trial had not requested
    production of the videotape prior to trial and that he had therefore failed to
    provide the appellant with competent representation.  The Crown argued, however, that counsel’s
    ineffective assistance at trial did not result in a miscarriage of justice as
    there was no reasonable possibility that the videotape could have affected the
    verdicts.  The summary conviction appeal
    judge accepted this submission and dismissed the conviction appeal.  He allowed the sentence appeal and imposed a
    conditional sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[5]<span

    are asked to grant leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction
    appeal judge refusing to admit the fresh evidence.  The appellant contends that on a proper
    application of the law in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>,
    [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, the videotape should have been admitted as fresh evidence,
    and a new trial should have been ordered. </span></p>

    would grant leave to appeal.  First,
    given it is conceded that the appellant did not receive effective assistance of
    counsel at <span class=GramE>trial,</span> the issue involving the fresh
    evidence goes directly and fundamentally to the proper administration of
    justice.  Second, in accepting the
    Crown’s argument that the fresh evidence could not reasonably have affected the
    result at trial, the summary conviction appeal court judge was not reviewing a
    decision made at trial, but was making a first-instance determination based on
    his assessment of the potential impact of the videotape on the trial
    evidence.  Consequently, unlike most
    summary conviction appeals, this court is not asked to enter upon a second
    review of a trial decision. Furthermore, as my reasons will demonstrate, there
    is substantial merit to this ground of appeal.  </span></p>

    April 17, 2005 at approximately 1:00 a.m., the first complainant, Christina
    Cravero, was seriously injured upon being struck on the face with a beer bottle
    while on the dance floor of a crowded Burlington bar. Immediately, someone in
    the bar spoke to Chad Stephenson, who was working as a bouncer that night, and pointed
    out a young Asian woman as the assailant.  Mr. Stephenson escorted the woman who was identified to him, outside of
    the bar.  There, Mr. Stephenson was
    confronted by several men.  During the
    confrontation, the woman Mr. Stephenson believed to be responsible for the
    assault on Ms. <span class=GramE>Cravero,</span> fled. Mr. Stephenson pursued
    her and was able to catch up with her because, according to his testimony, she
    was wearing high-heeled shoes and therefore could not run quickly. Stephenson struggled
    with the woman and she again managed to escape his grasp – this time by biting
    his arm for approximately ten seconds. </span></p>

    Stephenson testified that his assailant was then picked up by two men and
    carried toward the bar’s parking lot. Sameth Sey, a witness who met the
    appellant for the first time on the night of the offences, followed Mr. Stephenson
    as he struggled with the assailant. Mr. Sey gave evidence that the attacker was
    carried towards the parking lot and added that she and those assisting her in
    her escape drove away in a black car. </span></p>

    Goodwin, another bouncer at the bar, saw Mr. Stephenson’s second struggle with
    the assailant. He testified that the assailant ran from Mr. Stephenson to a red
    Honda in which she then left the premises, contradicting Mr. Stephenson’s
    evidence that she was carried away and Mr. Sey’s evidence that the car she got
    into was black.  Mr. Goodwin noted the

    her arrest, the police brought the appellant back to the bar.  Meghan Gibbons, a friend of Ms. Cravero,
    confirmed that the appellant was the individual who had attacked Ms. Cravero on
    the dance floor.  In his evidence, Mr.
    Goodwin also claimed that he identified the appellant to the police as the

    described her as an Asian female between 100 and 120 pounds with long dark
    hair. He was unable to describe the clothes she was wearing on the night of the

    memory by referring to the statement he had given to the police on the night of

    her evidence, Ms. Gibbons confirmed her earlier description of the assailant as

    Cravero twice described the assailant to police prior to trial as a 20-25 year

    trial judge rejected Mr. Sey’s evidence for several reasons. First, Mr. Sey
    testified that the appellant’s hair was blonde on the night of the incident,
    which the trial judge concluded was inconsistent with a photograph of the
    appellant that was taken three weeks later. Second, his explanation that he saw
    the complainant and the assailant apprehended by bouncers on the stage of the
    bar immediately following the attack contradicted the evidence of other
    witnesses that the assailant was apprehended near the door. Third, after
    claiming during his examination in chief that he could identify only the
    appellant in a photograph of four women, he admitted during cross-examination
    that he also recognized Ms. San, but offered no explanation for this change in
    evidence. Finally, despite knowing Ms. San for eight months prior to the trial,
    he testified that he could not recall if she was at the bar on the night of the
    incident or if she was the woman he saw struggling with Mr. Goodwin. The trial
    judge concluded that Mr. Sey was tailoring his evidence to assist the

    contradicted that of her boyfriend, Thoeun Thack, who testified that the
    appellant had seen Ms. San on several occasions since that night. He identified
    the appellant’s failure to advise the prosecution until the beginning of the
    trial that Ms. San was the assailant as an additional factor negatively
    affecting her credibility. The trial judge further found that the appellant’s
    testimony that she had blonde hair on the night of the incident was contrary to
    the evidence.  This evidence included a
    photograph taken several weeks later, the appellant’s denial that she had
    coloured her hair between the incident and the day the photograph was taken, a
    second photograph taken several weeks before the incident, the appellant’s hair
    colour at the time of trial, and the description of her hair in the police
    arrest report. </span></p>

    third defence witness was Mr. Thack. He was also at the bar on the night of the
    incident and testified that the appellant told him that someone had been hit
    with a beer bottle. He explained that he accompanied the appellant outside

    evidence was also rejected for several reasons. First, the trial judge noted
    his several charges for drug offences and failure to appear for court as well
    as his “obvious bias” given his relationship with the appellant. Second, his
    evidence that Ms. San was struggling with the larger of the two bouncers who
    testified for the Crown (Mr. Goodwin) contradicts the evidence of the other
    witnesses, which clearly established that it was Mr. Stephenson. Finally, his
    evidence that the appellant was in the back seat of the red Honda and that Ms.
    San had already escaped the bouncer’s grasp before he approached the bouncer,
    contradicted the testimony of the appellant that she was in the front seat of
    the car and that Mr. Thack approached the bouncer in an attempt to free Ms.
    San.</span></p>

    defence also called Jamie Reid, the D.J. at the bar on the night of the
    incident. He testified that, following the assault, which he admitted he did
    not witness, he saw a man who was not a bouncer bear hugging a young woman near
    the front door. He could not describe the woman or confirm that she was in any
    way involved in the assault. The trial judge found this witness credible but of

    the basis of the Crown’s evidence, the trial judge found that the same person

    the Crown has established that the appellant was the perpetrator of both
    offences.</span></p>

    decided not to admit the fresh evidence, the summary conviction appeal judge,
    in lengthy reasons, dismissed the appeal against conviction.  He rejected the argument that the verdict was
    unreasonable.  He also rejected the
    argument that the trial judge erred by placing an evidentiary burden on the
    appellant to prove that Ms. San was the perpetrator.  While he found that the trial judge erred in
    drawing a negative inference from the fact that the appellant failed to
    identify Ms. San as the perpetrator prior to trial, the summary conviction
    appeal judge concluded that this did not affect the result, given the other
    factors that supported the trial judge’s conclusion that the Crown had made out

    the fresh evidence must be viewed in the light of the fact that the Crown had
    not presented a strong case.  The evidence
    relevant to the only issue for the trial judge’s determination, namely,
    identification, had many of the well-known frailties that such evidence carries
    with it.   Some of the evidence involved
    cross-racial identification.  Some
    involved in-dock identification. There were significant inconsistencies among
    the evidence of the Crown witnesses, particularly the two bouncers. The
    eyewitness evidence was provided by witnesses asked to recall events that took
    place suddenly in a dark crowded bar over a short period of time.  The identification evidence was also tainted
    by the production of the suspect, sitting alone in the back of a police car, to
    two identification witnesses at the scene of the offences.   </span></p>

    the fresh evidence potentially undermines the evidence of Mr. Stephenson, the
    only Crown witness who gave evidence linking his assailant to the person who
    attacked Ms. Cravero.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[37]<span

    Stephenson’s testimony that the perpetrator wore high-heeled shoes was a
    central part of his evidence as the footwear explained why he was able to catch
    up with her after she broke free of his grasp the first time and why she was
    picked up and carried towards the back parking lot after escaping from him the
    second time. The videotape the appellant sought to admit as fresh evidence,
    which proves that the appellant wore flat-soled boots on the night of the
    assaults, is clearly inconsistent with Mr. Stephenson’s description, particularly
    his assertion that the appellant was wearing high-heeled shoes, an aspect of
    his description that was an integral part of the narrative.  As such, the fresh evidence is highly
    relevant to the reliability of Mr. Stephenson’s identification evidence. </span></p>

    I go on to note the potential impact the fresh evidence could have on the
    appellant’s credibility.  At trial, the
    appellant gave a description of what she was wearing at the bar.  This description was entirely consistent with
    the videotape, evidence that she did not know existed at the time of her
    testimony.  The independent corroboration
    of the appellant’s evidence in this respect could only help bolster her
    credibility.   </span></p>
