  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from his Notice of Application that among
    the relief sought by the appellant was a declaration that he “continues to be
    the absolute owner of the lands described in PIN 31451-0072”.  His argument that the application judge did
    not have jurisdiction to decide the issue of ownership because there was “no
    request to the judge to make a determination of ownership” is without
    merit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Deputy Director of Titles noted in his reasons,
    he was </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… not entitled to decide whether or not Mr. Lumme
    has acquired any interest in lands that are part of Lot 1, Concession 2,
    Registered Plan 8 Cuthberston Location as a result of any acts of possession he
    made in reliance on the Miller survey … </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And the Divisional Court <span class=GramE>affirmed,</span> that in confirming the true location of the boundary on the ground, the Deputy
    Director’s finding was not a grant of ownership or possession.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said<span class=GramE>,</span> there was ample
    evidence before the application judge for him to make the determination he did.
    The transfers by <span class=GramE>which</span> the appellant acquired title
    only ever purported to convey part of Lot 4, Concession 2. No part of Lot 1 was
    ever part of any conveyance to the appellant and his title is limited
    accordingly. The Reference Plan relied on by the appellant does not convey any
    interest in property. It is a reference plan and only that.  Section 53(42) of the <i>Planning Act</i> does not alter this result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the appellant was purporting to make a claim of
    ownership to the disputed parcel of land based on possession, the time to do it
    was before the application judge.  On the
    evidence it is clear that the Miller survey was in error and the evidence of
    Surveyor Bolan to that effect was uncontradicted. The <i>Land Titles Act</i> only guarantees the quality of one’s title, not the
    extent of it.  On the documentary
    evidence, including the deeds, transfers, abstracts and boundary decision, it
    is clear that the appellant had no interest in any part of Lot 1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the decision made by the Deputy Director
    of Titles is to correct the location of the boundary which divides Lots 1 and 4
    from what is depicted on the Miller survey, which was an error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conveyance to the appellant only ever purported to
    convey part of Lot 4.  However, because the
    description contained in the deed was based on the erroneous Miller survey it described,
    in part, lands located on Lot 1. Such lands were never owned by the appellant’s
    predecessor in title and could not be transferred to him by deed.  Absent any claim to title by possession or
    use, the application judge’s determination of ownership was inevitable. It does
    not appear that any claim to some entitlement to title based on possession was
    ever part of the appellant’s case and, in any event, the affidavit of Ken
    Richmond sworn September 2, 2010 disproves any such entitlement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the decision of the application judge
    and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal,
    fixed in the sum of $5000.00, inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
