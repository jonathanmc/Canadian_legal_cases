  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.         INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge
    erred in awarding lump sum spousal support to the respondent in the amount of
    $135,000. To decide this issue, it is necessary that we consider the principles
    that govern such awards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        BACKGROUND </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the respondent were common law
    spouses. They began living together in London, Ontario in December 1982, when
    they were 41 and 42 years of age respectively. Both parties had been married previously
    and both had children from their former marriages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After 23 years together, the parties separated in June
    2005. At the time of trial in February 2009, the appellant was 64 years of age
    and the respondent was 66. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1)       The Parties’ Work Histories</span></h4>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(a)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       The Appellant</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the parties began living together in 1982, the
    appellant had just started a collection business, Imperial Collection Agencies,
    with a business partner. The appellant owned 50% of Imperial through a numbered
    company, 1145441 Ontario Limited (“114”), and his business partner, David
    Gordon, owned the other 50%. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In about 1996, Mr. Gordon indicated he planned to
    retire. The appellant bought him out in 1997 and incorporated a new business, <span
class=SpellE>Torlon</span> Credit Recovery Inc. <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> purchased Imperial’s client list and subsequently paid a percentage of its
    revenue to Imperial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Gordon died in late 2003. As a result of insurance
    payouts, the appellant’s company, 114, received a capital dividend of $220,000
    and a regular dividend of $112,707. The company, in turn, declared dividends to
    the appellant, which were paid out to him and his daughter Kathy between
    October 2004 and July 2006. According to the appellant’s evidence at trial, he
    gave his daughter Kathy $125,476 and loaned her another $50,000, which he
    subsequently forgave.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also testified that he sold the <span
class=SpellE>Torlon</span> business to a Stephen Shaw in August 2003. He said
    that he retired from <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> in 2003 and that he subsequently
    received only small payments to reimburse him for expenses incurred assisting Mr.
    Shaw and entertaining clients. He claimed that he retained half the
    shareholdings only to ensure that a corporate loan was repaid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, as of January 2009 (the
    month before the trial began), the retained earnings in 114, from which he had
    previously been drawing dividend income, were exhausted. From this point on, he
    testified, his only sources of income would be his R.R.S.P. and C.P.P., plus
    Old Age Security when he turned 65. The appellant valued his R.R.S.P. at
    $435,871 as of March 2008. He testified that he had been told by his financial
    advisor to withdraw $1,700 monthly from his R.R.S.P. to make it last as long as
    possible.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       The Respondent</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between 1982 and 1996, the respondent worked full-time
    at
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London in
    the human resources department. She was promoted during this period and by 1996
    was earning an annual salary of $53,000. She retired in 1996 and received a
    $30,000 severance package.  The
    respondent worked intermittently between 1996 and 1999 and did some work for <span
class=SpellE>Torlon</span> during this period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1999, the respondent was diagnosed with a
    non-malignant brain tumour. She had successful surgery in January 2000, but
    suffered a stroke and was hospitalized for three months. Following her surgery,
    the respondent retired from the workforce.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of trial, the respondent’s income was $2,250
    per month, consisting of about $1,210 per month from a workplace pension and
    about $1,040 per month in Old Age Security and C.P.P. payments. Her financial
    statement, sworn January 12, 2009, shows a monthly deficit of income versus
    expenses of $1,470.76.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2)       The Parties’ Living Arrangements during
    Cohabitation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until 1997, the parties lived in houses owned by the
    appellant in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London.
    They moved to Toronto in 1997, but soon after moved to an apartment in London
    and then to a cottage they had purchased on <span class=SpellE>Kosh</span> Lake
    in 1990. In 2002, they purchased a property on White Lake; in 2003, they sold
    the <span class=SpellE>Kosh</span> Lake property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the course of their relationship, the parties
    both contributed to their household expenses from their respective incomes. On
    the trial judge’s undisputed findings, they “enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle
    throughout their relationship” and lived in “upscale housing”, at least while
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London. They
    “enjoyed <span class=SpellE>cottaging</span> from early on … and enjoyed
    searching for properties with older ‘tear down’ cottages.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent raised issues at trial concerning
    whether the appellant improperly diverted to himself portions of the proceeds
    of sale of the
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <span class=SpellE>Kosh</span>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake property or portions of the
    proceeds of various mortgages on both the
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <span
 class=SpellE>Kosh</span>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake
    and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Lake properties.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (3)       Post-Separation Arrangements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the parties’ separation, the respondent
    continued to live in the White Lake property until it was sold in 2006 for
    $625,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant maintained the mortgage on the White Lake
    property while the respondent occupied it. He also continued to pay the loan
    payments on a car in his name that the respondent drove. Although, at some
    point, the appellant cancelled the respondent’s medical coverage, he reinstated
    it after she confronted him and thereafter maintained it, at least until the
    White Lake property was sold. Based on our review of the record, it appears
    that, prior to the sale of the White Lake property, the appellant was making
    payments benefitting the respondent amounting to more than $1,500 per month. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subject to a consent payout of $25,000 to each party,
    the net proceeds of sale of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake property were held
    in trust pending trial. As of December 4, 2008, the appellant’s share of the
    net proceeds was $172,041.50. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (4)       The Respondent’s Application and the
    Positions of the Parties at Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent issued her application against the
    appellant on December 6, 2007.  She made
    no direct claim regarding property. In addition to lump sum spousal support,
    the respondent claimed periodic spousal support commencing June 8, 2005. She
    did not bring a motion for interim support prior to trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the respondent’s sole request was for lump
    sum spousal support in an amount equal to the appellant’s share of the net
    proceeds of sale of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake property. The appellant
    countered that, on the facts of this case, the respondent was not entitled to any
    spousal support.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.      THE TRIAL
    JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of reviewing the background facts of this
    matter, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that he did not
    divert to his own use monies from the sale of the
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <span
 class=SpellE>Kosh</span>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake
    property or from the mortgaging of the
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <span
 class=SpellE>Kosh</span>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake
    and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Lake properties. She also noted, “[t]he
    [respondent] had every reason to believe that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge began her analysis by considering the
    financial positions of the parties. She found that, “[w]<span class=SpellE>ith</span> some minor exceptions, the [respondent’s] assets consist of her interest in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType

    Lake property and her [workplace]
    pension which generates approximately $1,200 per month.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the appellant, the trial judge observed,
    “[t]he [appellant’s] assets are more difficult to quantify.” She noted the
    details of his R.R.S.P. and then stated, “[h]<span class=SpellE>owever</span>,
    I find that the [appellant] also has other assets, some of which are not
    capable of quantification.” The trial judge itemized three other financial
    resources to which she concluded the appellant was entitled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she found that the appellant was the beneficial
    owner of $175,476 paid by 114 to his daughter Kathy in late 2005 and 2006.
    Second, she concluded that <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> continued to do
    business and that the appellant continued to be a one-half owner of that business.
    She said, “[t]his is an asset which I cannot ignore but cannot quantify.”
    Third, she concluded that it was “highly likely” that the appellant and his new
    significant other were “engaging in the same venture which the parties did
    during their cohabitation, i.e., purchasing a tear-down cottage and building a
    new one.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the respondent’s existing
    assets and means were   “considerably
    less” than the appellant’s. She noted as well that the appellant was likely to
    receive a significant inheritance from an uncle in the near future. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, the trial judge recognized the
    significance of the parties’ cohabitation, observing, “[w]<span class=SpellE>hile</span> they may not have commingled their financial resources as many partners do,
    they lived together and relied on each other for financial and non-financial
    support over a lengthy period.” She also concluded, “[t]he [respondent] will
    never be able to maintain a reasonable lifestyle in any way comparable to that
    enjoyed by the parties during cohabitation without support from the [appellant].”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s argument that,
    as an unmarried spouse, he could not be required to pay lump sum spousal
    support from assets not subject to the provincial property regime. She
    concluded that this was an appropriate case for lump sum spousal support, and
    that the respondent was entitled to an award of $135,000:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The [appellant] argues that any order I make for
    lump sum support is in effect a redistribution of assets which is not permitted
    by the Act because the parties were not married … I disagree. <i>Section 34(1)(b) of the </i>Family Law Act<i> specifically permits the payment of a lump
    sum</i> for support. <i>I can think of no
    more appropriate case for lump sum support than the present one. The [respondent]
    is deprived of any claim for property because the parties were not married.
    That does not mean that the [appellant’s] assets should not be available for a
    support order, if the [respondent] is otherwise entitled to support, and I find
    that she is</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that in the circumstances of this case the
    [respondent] is entitled to lump sum support. However, I do not agree with her
    contention that I should simply order a lump sum equal to the [appellant’s]
    share of the net proceeds of sale of the White Lake property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have come to the conclusion that <i>an appropriate lump sum payment for spousal
    support is $135,000. That puts the [respondent] in a slightly better position than
    she would have been had the White Lake property been mortgage-free. At a 4 per
    cent rate of interest, it will generate approximately $1,000 monthly income for
    15 years.</i> <i>The quantification of lump
    sum support is not an exact science</i> but I find the sum of $135,000 is fair.

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.      THE
    APPELLANT’S POSITION ON APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    awarding spousal support on the facts of this case, as the parties’ assets and
    means are approximately equivalent. He contends that the trial judge made
    palpable and overriding errors and engaged in speculation in holding that he
    (the appellant) has assets in addition to his R.R.S.P. and his share of the
    proceeds of sale of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake property. In support
    of this submission, the appellant delivered a motion to admit fresh evidence in
    an effort to demonstrate that the trial judge’s findings concerning the monies he
    gave his daughter and his ongoing interest in <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> are wrong. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge’s decision to award lump sum spousal support is contrary to the principles
    enunciated in <span class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Mannarino</span></i> (1992), 43 R.F.L. (3d) 309 (Ont. C.A.). In <span class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span>, this court said that
    lump sum spousal support is only to be awarded in very unusual circumstances,
    where there is a real risk that periodic support will not be paid, and that lump
    sum spousal support should not be awarded to effect a redistribution of
    property in the guise of support or where it would be unfair to deprive the <span
class=SpellE>payor</span> of the ability to apply for a variation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The law is clear that lump sum maintenance should
    be awarded only in very unusual circumstances, where there is a real risk that
    periodic payments would not be made. Such awards should not constitute a
    redistribution of family assets in the guise of support. See <span
class=SpellE><i>Jazenko</i></span><i> v. <span class=SpellE>Jazenko</span></i> (1985), 46 R.F.L. (2d) 351 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Execution of the judgment at trial would result not
    only in a substantial redistribution of family property but would make it
    impossible for the husband to apply to the court for a reduction of support
    should there be a substantial change in his personal circumstances in the
    future. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, the judgment for lump sum support in
    this case was contrary to the law and was unfair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that his interpretation of <span
class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span> has
    been applied in a number of decisions of this court (for example, see <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Elliot v. Elliot </span></i><span class=resultsublistitem1><span

    O.A.C. 335; <i>Eccles v. Eccles </i>(2003),
    43 R.F.L. (5th) 321</span>) – and that recent decisions departing from the <span
class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span> principles were incorrectly decided (for example, see <i><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>Greenberg
    v. Daniels </span></i><span class=resultsublistitem1><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

     </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant acknowledges that lump sum spousal
    support may properly be awarded in other limited circumstances: situations involving
    very short-term marriages; in some circumstances, to effect “a clean break”
    between the parties, particularly in situations involving domestic violence;
    and perhaps even in very exceptional cases as an award of compensatory support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant submits that these situations
    fit generally within the <span class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span> principles. They are made only in very unusual circumstances involving at least
    some of the <span class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span> factors together with other limited special circumstances, such as those described
    above. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that an award of lump sum
    spousal support is always inappropriate where it is used to effect a
    redistribution of capital or where there is a possibility that one party may
    need to vary the order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, none of the factors that
    would justify an award of lump sum spousal support is present in this case and
    the factors that are present militate against such an award. In particular, the
    appellant points out that he voluntarily paid the respondent’s living expenses
    until the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    White
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Lake property was sold. Thereafter, he
    continued to pay her car loan and provide medical benefits. Further, on the
    facts of this case, the appellant takes the position that the lump sum award amounts
    to a redistribution of capital. Finally, the appellant argues that, depending
    on his health, he may well require his share of the proceeds of sale of the
    matrimonial home as he ages to provide for himself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, the appellant submits that the
    amount of the lump sum award is excessive.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>V.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (1)       The Trial Judge’s Findings Concerning
    the Appellant’s Assets</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not satisfied that the appellant has
    demonstrated that the trial judge made palpable and overriding errors or that
    she engaged in speculation in holding that the appellant has assets in addition
    to his R.R.S.P. and his share of the proceeds of sale of the White Lake
    property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s findings concerning the appellant’s
    assets are findings of credibility, which are entitled to considerable
    deference. She found it “impossible to believe” that the appellant, an
    experienced businessman, favoured one of his daughters over his other children
    by providing her with a gift of $175,476 on the eve of his retirement,
    particularly where his evidence was not supported by any testimony from the
    daughter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the trial judge found it “simply not
    believable” that the appellant had no ongoing interest in <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> where the appellant retained a 50% interest in the company, where no post-2005
    financial statements were produced and where his evidence was not supported by
    any testimony from Mr. Shaw. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge found the appellant’s
    testimony that he had no knowledge about a mortgage his significant other
    placed on her property “simply incredible” having regard to the appellant and
    respondent’s history of purchasing tear-down cottages and the fact that his
    evidence was not supported by any testimony from his new partner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s findings of credibility were rooted
    in her assessment of the evidence. Having rejected the appellant’s evidence, it
    was open to the trial judge to draw the inferences that she did based on the
    record that was before her.  There is no basis
    upon which to interfere with her findings regarding the appellant’s assets. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2)       The Appellant’s Fresh Evidence Application</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s fresh evidence application is
    dismissed. The application consists largely of affidavits and exhibits that
    could have been produced at trial. The material contains no explanation as to why
    the affiants of the affidavits were not called at trial and no explanation
    concerning why the exhibits that existed at the time of trial were not produced
    prior to trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also note that the 2006 and 2007 financial
    statements for <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> that Mr. Shaw claims were
    prepared following the trial are undated. Moreover, Mr. Shaw’s explanation that <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> has “only recently been able to afford to have
    these Statements prepared” is bald and unpersuasive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a whole, the fresh evidence application fails
    entirely to meet the requirement of demonstrating that such evidence could not
    have been obtained, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, prior to trial: <i><span style='line-height:200%'>R. v. Palmer</span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed fresh evidence that is central to the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s daughter’s affidavit supports the

    not the issue at trial. The issue was whether the money was being sheltered for
    the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The daughter explains that the appellant gave her the
    money so she and her husband could purchase a house where the appellant could
    live with them. However, the fact remains that the appellant’s name does not
    appear on a deed to property to which he apparently contributed about $150,000.
    Although this omission is not addressed directly by the appellant’s daughter,
    the explanation appears to be that it was intended that the appellant could
    live in the home rent and utility free in the future. The same plan apparently remains
    in effect as a contingency plan for the future, even though the appellant is
    not living with his daughter now. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the affidavit of the appellant’s
    daughter does not provide any disclosure of her family’s income and assets that
    would reveal whether she and her husband have funds equivalent to the monies
    advanced by the appellant available in relatively liquid form elsewhere. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the appellant’s failure to call his
    daughter as a witness at trial, the relationship between the parties, the
    timing of the alleged gift (post-separation and allegedly on the eve of, or
    post, retirement) and the daughter’s failure to provide financial disclosure,
    her affidavit, filed on the fresh evidence application, lacks sufficient weight
    to meet the fourth branch of the <i>Palmer</i> test for the admission of fresh evidence (credible </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Shaw’s affidavit confirms, by relatively bald
    statements, the appellant’s evidence that <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> pays
    the appellant only for expenses. Appended to the affidavit are unaudited and
    undated financial statements for <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span> for 2006 and
    2007. Mr. Shaw gives no explanation concerning why the appellant continues to
    retain an interest in <span class=SpellE>Torlon</span>. This material, too,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the spousal support provisions in both Acts
    and the jurisprudence interpreting those provisions (including <span
class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span> and its
    progeny) do provide considerable guidance concerning the factors that should be
    considered in determining whether an award of lump sum spousal support is
    appropriate in any particular case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well accepted – and undisputed – that a lump sum
    award should not be made in the guise of support for the purpose of
    redistributing assets: <span class=SpellE><i>Mannarino</i></span>; <span class=SpellE><i>Willemze</i></span><i>-Davidson v. Davidson </i><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>(1997), 98
    O.A.C. 335 (C.A.),</span> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 32. Moreover, the
    governing legislation does not recognize redistribution of assets as one of the
    purposes of a spousal support award. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That said, a lump sum order can be made to <span
style='line-height:200%'>“</span><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%;color:black;'>relieve [against] financial hardship, if this has not been done by

class=GramE>)(</span>d).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the purpose of an award must always be
    distinguished from its effect. Any lump sum award that is made will have the
    effect of transferring assets from one spouse to the other. The real question
    in any particular case is the underlying purpose of the order: <span
class=SpellE><i>Willemze</i></span><i>-Davidson</i> at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, it is well accepted that an important
    consideration in determining whether to make a lump sum spousal support award
    is whether the <span class=SpellE>payor</span> has the ability to make a lump
    sum payment without undermining the <span class=SpellE>payor’s</span> future
    self-sufficiency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 33(9) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, <span style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These statutory provisions make it clear that ability
    to pay is an important consideration in making an award of spousal support, including
    lump sum spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most importantly, a court considering an award of lump
    sum spousal support must weigh the perceived advantages of making a lump sum
    award in the particular case against any presenting disadvantages of making
    such an order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The advantages of making such an award will be highly
    variable and case-specific. They can include but are not limited to:
    terminating ongoing contact or ties between the spouses for any number of
    reasons (for example: short-term marriage; domestic violence; second marriage
    with no children, etc.); providing capital to meet an immediate need on the
    part of a dependant spouse; ensuring adequate support will be paid in
    circumstances where there is a real risk of non-payment of periodic support, a lack
    of proper financial disclosure or where the <span class=SpellE>payor</span> has
    the ability to pay lump sum but not periodic support; and satisfying immediately
    an award of retroactive spousal support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the disadvantages of such an award can
    include: the real possibility that the means and needs of the parties will
    change over time, leading to the need for a variation; the fact that the parties
    will be effectively deprived of the right to apply for a variation of the lump
    sum award; and the difficulties inherent in calculating an appropriate award of
    lump sum spousal support where lump sum support is awarded in place of ongoing indefinite
    periodic support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, it is for the presiding judge to consider
    the factors relevant to making a spousal support award on the facts of the
    particular case and to exercise his or her discretion in determining whether a
    lump sum award is appropriate and the appropriate quantum of such an award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, we do not endorse the submission that
    lump sum spousal support awards must be limited to “very unusual circumstances”
    as a matter of principle. Nonetheless, we agree that most spousal support
    orders will be in the form of periodic payments. To a large extent, this is for
    four very practical reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in many instances, monies will simply not be
    available to fund a lump sum support award either to take the place of, or to supplement,
    an award of periodic support.  Instead,
    support will be paid from one spouse’s income, the only available source for
    support payments, and it will be paid to finance the ongoing needs of the other
    spouse, which will generally be of a periodic rather than lump sum character.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, for married couples, the court will have
    determined already the amount to be paid to equalize the value of the spouses’ net
    family properties: see s. 5, <i>Family Law
    Act</i>. In many circumstances, this payment will obviate any requirements a
    dependent spouse may have for transitional capital. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, in many cases, there will be no considerations
    favouring a lump sum award from the perspective of either spouse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, in at least some cases where there are
    considerations favouring a lump sum award, the general exigencies of life,
    including the possibility that the parties’ means and <span class=GramE>needs
    will</span> change, will outweigh the considerations favouring a lump sum
    award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Irrespective of whether the proposed support is
    periodic or lump sum, it is incumbent upon counsel to provide the judge deciding
    the matter with submissions concerning the basis for awarding and the method of
    calculating the proposed support, together with a range of possible outcomes. Further,
    it is highly desirable that a judge making a lump sum award provide a clear
    explanation of both the basis for exercising the discretion to award lump sum
    support and the rationale for arriving at a particular figure. Clear presentations
    by counsel and explanations by trial judges will make such an award more transparent
    and enhance the appearance of justice. Over time, this approach will
    undoubtedly foster greater consistency and predictability in the result.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of this approach, where an award of lump sum
    spousal support is made as a substitute for an award of periodic support, it is
    preferable that, with the benefit of submissions from counsel, the judge consider
    whether the amount awarded is in keeping with the <i>Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines</i> <span lang=EN-US>(Ottawa, Department of Justice, 2008) (the “<i>Guidelines</i>”)</span>.  If it is not, some reasons should be provided
    for why the <i>Guidelines</i> do not provide
    an appropriate result: <i>Fisher v. Fisher </i>(2008)<i>, </i><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>88 O.R. (3d) 241 (C.A.), at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        (b)       Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge did not offer a detailed
    explanation for her award, read fairly, her reasons make it clear that she
    awarded lump sum spousal support based on a real concern that the appellant
    would not pay periodic support and to <span class=GramE>effect</span> a clean
    break between these parties. Again, while the trial judge did not say so
    explicitly, it is apparent that these factors outweighed considerations
    militating against lump sum spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A main theme of the trial judge’s reasons was her credibility-based
    findings that the appellant had greater assets and means than he was prepared
    to acknowledge and that he was attempting to shelter assets from the
    respondent’s reach. Having regard to these findings, it is readily apparent
    that the trial judge concluded there was a real risk the appellant would not
    pay periodic support and that this factor alone mandated an award of lump sum
    support, even though the appellant would be deprived of the ability to seek a
    variation. Further, the appellant’s failure to make proper disclosure made a
    clean break highly desirable – in the absence of a clean break, the respondent
    likely faced unending litigation to maintain her entitlement to spousal
    support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances, we see no basis on which to
    interfere with the trial judge’s decision to award lump sum spousal support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to quantum, as we read her reasons, the trial
    judge awarded an amount of support that she concluded would generate an income
    stream of $1,000 per month for 15 years using a 4% interest rate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unfortunate that the trial judge did not provide
    additional details concerning how she arrived at either the $1,000 per month
    quantum or the 15-year duration as the basis for her calculations.  However, the respondent’s financial statement
    discloses that the respondent has a monthly deficit well in excess of $1,000
    per month based on claimed expenses that are in a relatively modest range. Further,
    it is apparent from her reasons that the trial judge was satisfied that the
    appellant had the means to maintain a much higher standard of living than the
    respondent and that, without a significant payment, the respondent would be
    relegated to a significantly lower standard of living than that which the
    parties enjoyed together for 23 years. Although the trial judge did not refer
    specifically to the income tax consequences of a lump sum support award, she is
    an experienced family law judge and we are not prepared to conclude that she
    did not take the income tax consequences into account. On our review of the
    record and the trial judge’s reasons, it is reasonable to conclude that the
    trial judge decided that her calculations should be premised on the respondent
    receiving $1,000 per month net of tax. Finally, given that the respondent had
    attained the age of 66 and that there was no evidence indicating she was not in
    good health, we cannot say that using a 15-year income stream projection was
    unreasonable. In making that award, the trial judge undoubtedly took account of
    the contingency that the respondent’s need for support could be longer or
    shorter than 15 years. Although a more detailed explanation of the figures the
    trial judge used in making her calculations would have been desirable, in the
    end, we cannot say the award was clearly wrong. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that the appellant does not challenge the trial
    judge’s arithmetic. Indeed, neither counsel provided us with any calculations
    to establish that the award of $135,000 is clearly wrong in any way, including as
    being outside the ranges that would be generated by the <i>Guidelines</i>. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, the appeal is
