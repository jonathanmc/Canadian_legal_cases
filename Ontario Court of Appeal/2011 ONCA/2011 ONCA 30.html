  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue <span class=GramE>raised</span> by the
    appellants, <span class=SpellE>Sonka</span> Properties<i> </i>Inc. (“<span class=SpellE>Sonka</span>”) and the Estate of Sonia
    Kaiser, is straightforward. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants challenge the trial judge’s conclusion
    that although the Estate of Sonia Kaiser is the legal owner of the shares of <span
class=SpellE>Sonka</span>, the beneficial owner of the shares is the late Sonia
    Kaiser’s surviving husband, Morris Kaiser.  The appellants argue that Sonia Kaiser (or her estate) was always both
    the legal and beneficial owner of the shares in <span class=SpellE>Sonka</span>.  They submit that the trial judge was not
    entitled to come to the conclusion that Morris Kaiser was the beneficial owner
    of the shares.  The appellants submit
    that in order to come to that conclusion, the trial judge would have had to
    find either that there was a trust in favour of Morris Kaiser or that a fraud
    had been committed.  However, fraud was
    not pleaded and the trial judge made no express finding that a trust existed.
    Further, the appellants submit that the requirements of a trust are not met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  Section 1(1) of the <i>Business
    Corporations Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>c</span>. B. 16 (“<i>OBCA</i>”) defines “beneficial interest” and
    “beneficial ownership” as including “ownership through a trustee, legal
    representative, agent or other intermediary”.  The definition in the <i>OBCA </i>indicates
    that beneficial interest can exist outside a finding that a trust exists or
    that a fraud has taken place. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Existing jurisprudence also supports the conclusion
    that a beneficial owner is one who has an equitable claim to shares whether or
    not they have been issued and appropriated to him.  Beneficial ownership is not limited to
    ownership through a trustee.  See <span
class=SpellE><i>Fedel</i></span><i> v. Tan </i>(2008), 93 O.R. (3d) 274 (S.C.),
    at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 209 and 216. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The question of
    whether the trial judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that Morris
    Kaiser was the beneficial owner of the shares must be considered against the
    background of the evidence relating to Morris Kaiser and Sonia Kaiser’s
    respective involvements with <span class=SpellE>Sonka</span>.  Morris Kaiser was an accountant who was the
    person primarily responsible for instructing counsel in connection with the
    corporate structure through which the shares in issue were distributed. When Morris
    Kaiser’s father, Maier Kaiser, passed away in 1977, his interests in certain predecessor
    companies passed to his estate.  Maier’s
    widow enjoyed a life interest in the estate and, upon her death in 2005, the
    residue passed to each of their three children, Morris Kaiser being one of
    them.  The successor by amalgamation of
    the predecessor companies was Paragon Development Corporation, whose shares
    were acquired by 583533. As of November 30, 1984, all of the shares of 583533
    came to be held by various holding companies, of which <span class=SpellE>Sonka</span> was one. Morris Kaiser enjoyed the use, benefit and absolute control of <span
class=SpellE>Sonka’s</span> shares and he exercised that control over a lengthy
    period of time well past Sonia’s death in 1993.  By contrast, Sonia Kaiser was described as being unversed in financial
    affairs.  There was no evidence that she
    was ever appointed as an officer or director, or exercised any powers as a
    shareholder prior to her death.  The
    facts found by the trial judge support his conclusion that Morris Kaiser was
    the beneficial owner of the shares. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, it was not necessary for the
    trial judge to make an express finding that the shares of <span class=SpellE>Sonka</span> were held in trust for Morris Kaiser.  A
    bare trustee holds legal title to property on behalf of another and has no
    independent power, discretion or responsibility in connection with the
    property.  That description fits the
    trial judge’s findings respecting Sonia Kaiser.  In making the findings he did, the trial judge
    implicitly found Sonia Kaiser to be a bare trustee who held title to <span
class=SpellE>Sonka’s</span> shares for Morris Kaiser. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of our conclusion that Sonia Kaiser is a bare
    trustee and not entitled to any distribution, the appellant’s submission that
    the time limit for bringing an action against the estate of Sonia Kaiser
    arising out of the operation of ss. 38(2) and (3) of the <i>Trustee Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990,
    c. T.23, has passed and that the respondent cannot withhold a distribution to
    the estate of Sonia Kaiser, is irrelevant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In any event,
    ss. 38(2) and (3) <span class=GramE>have</span> no application to this
    appeal.  The effect of ss. 38(2) and (3)
    is to require that actions for wrongs committed by the deceased, for <span
class=GramE>which</span> the estate is liable, must be brought within two years
    of the date of the death of the deceased.  Section 38 was enacted to create an exception to the draconian rule that
    actions that were personal to the deceased did not survive death, while at the
    same time imposing a limitation period to avoid creating indefinite exposure to
    the estate:  <span class=SpellE><i>Waschkowski</i></span><i> v. Hopkinson Estate </i>(2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 370 (C.A.), at p. 373. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No wrong is alleged against Sonia Kaiser
    personally.  This is a pure economic loss
    claim.  No claim is made against the
    estate of Sonia Kaiser.  The estate was
    simply added as a defendant, on consent, in order to allow it to make
    submissions as an affected party, because any order affecting <span
class=SpellE>Sonka’s</span> entitlement to a distribution from 583533 would
    indirectly affect the estate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, no limitation period would apply.  This action was, in essence, an oppression
    action based on breach of fiduciary duty.  The trial judge’s order to withhold distribution to <span class=SpellE>Sonka</span> was based on the equitable rule in <i>Cherry
    v. <span class=SpellE>Boultbee</span> </i>(1839), 41 E.R. 171, or,
    alternatively, in the court’s broad discretion to make an order under s. 248(3)
    of the <i>Ontario Business Corporations Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. B 16, as amended. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the
    respondents fixed in the amount of $17,500 inclusive of taxes, but with
    disbursements payable in addition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the appeal has been dismissed, the cross-appeal
    is moot and is also dismissed with costs to the cross-appellants fixed in the
    amount of $4,000 inclusive of all taxes and disbursements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If necessary, further brief submissions as to the
    manner of payment of costs may be made in writing.</p>
