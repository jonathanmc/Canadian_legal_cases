  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal revolves around a single question: is the
    plaintiff bound by a spousal waiver that she signed in respect of her husband’s
    pension?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 44 of the <i>Pension
    Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8<i> </i>(“<i>PBA</i>”) requires every pension paid to a
    member with a spouse on the date of the first instalment of the pension to be a
    joint and survivor pension.  However, s.
    46(1) of the <i>PBA</i> permits those who
    are entitled to a joint and survivor pension to waive their entitlement by delivering
    a written waiver in the form approved by the Superintendent.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The waiver that the plaintiff signed was not the
    Superintendent approved form.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the executed spousal waiver deviates from
    the Superintendent approved form in matters affecting substance and the
    plaintiff is not bound by it.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jim Smith worked for Casco Inc. for approximately 39
    years.  At first, he was a labourer in
    which he did the “dirty jobs”.  In the
    process, he was exposed to high levels of n-hexane and benzene, which apparently
    are carcinogens. Later, he rose to be a supervisor and production trouble
    shooter at the Cardinal plant, a position of significant responsibility.  Although he had a modest education, his
    income in the last few years of employment was just under $100,000.   At one point, Jim and his wife, Judith Smith,
    moved to a home just three blocks from the plant so that Mr. Smith could
    respond more readily to his many call-backs.  He received congratulations from the company president and was described
    as a committed and valuable employee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Smith was a member of the Casco pension
    plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In about February 2000, Mr. Smith told his wife that
    Casco was offering an exit incentive program that would give them a bonus of approximately
    $76,000 and a full pension if he were prepared to retire early, at the age of
    58.  After 39 years on the job, they were
    both excited at the prospect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judith Smith was entirely dependent on her husband’s
    income.  She and Jim were married in 1961,
    when they were both young.  With only a
    Grade 9 education, she had no significant employment history outside of the
    home.  She relied entirely on her husband
    in terms of financial matters.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pension was critical to the couple’s future.  Apart from their house, which they did not
    intend to sell, their only other asset consisted of RRSPs totalling about
    $168,000 (including the early retirement bonus).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Smith was presented with fourteen pension options from which to choose.  By default, pursuant to Option 5 he would
    have received a monthly pension of $3,322.39 up to his 65<sup>th</sup> birthday. Thereafter, he would have received $2,758.22 per month for life. Had
    Mr. Smith selected this option, Judith Smith would have been entitled to a
    survivor’s pension of $1,654.93 per month for life, if he predeceased her.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Instead,
    Mr. Smith chose Option 2, under which he was entitled to a pension of $3,590.39
    per month until he turned 65, and then $3,026.23 per month for life, guaranteed
    for 60 months, that is until July 1, 2005. Pursuant to this option, his wife
    was entitled to no survivor benefits beyond July 1, 2005.  He signed the necessary paperwork to select
    Option 2 and take early retirement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    order for Mr. Smith to select Option 2, Judith Smith was required to sign a form
    that had been prepared by Casco.  Part of
    the title to the document was “Postretirement Spousal Survivor Benefit Waiver
    Form” (the “Casco Spousal Waiver”).  The
    form is set out in full in Schedule A to these reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    June 14, 2000, Jim brought the Casco Spousal Waiver home with him at
    lunchtime.  He told Judith that she had
    to sign it so he could retire.  She “glanced
    at it” and then signed it.  She did not read
    the Casco Spousal Waiver carefully.  O</span>nly
    the first substantive paragraph, which she understood assured her of a 60%
    survivor’s pension, “really jumped out” at her.  The Casco Spousal Waiver referred to section 44 of the <i>PBA</i>, a matter about which Mrs. Smith
    knew nothing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Smith took the exit incentive program and retired from Casco on July 1, 2000,
    at age 58.  At the time, he was in apparent
    good health.  However, on November 5,
    2003, he was unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer.  He died less than a month later, on December
    3, 2003.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Smith then learned that her husband had chosen a
    single life pension guaranteed for five years, a period that would expire in
    June 2005.  After that date, Mrs. Smith’s
    only income has been from CPP, in the amount of $5,600 to $5,900 a year.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She brought an action against Casco for negligent
    misrepresentation in respect of the information it had provided her and her
    husband about the pension options.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time of trial, Mrs. Smith had sold her house,
    was living in rented accommodation, had exhausted virtually all of her savings,
    and had outstanding income tax and Visa bills.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In advance of trial, the parties agreed on damages, in
    the event that Casco was found liable.  Those damages amounted to Mrs. Smith being paid pension benefits as if
    her husband had chosen Option 5.  Thus,
    they consisted of a lump sum to the date of trial and thereafter, payment of $1,654.93
    per month for the balance of Judith Smith’s life, less any deduction for
    contributory negligence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, much evidence was led about what Casco did
    and did not do when providing the Smiths with information about the various
    pension options and their consequences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that there had been negligent
    misrepresentation on the part of Casco and no contributory negligence on Mrs.
    Smith’s part.  By judgment dated May 29,
    2008, he ordered damages in the agreed on amounts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Casco appealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, a majority of the Divisional Court upheld
    the trial decision on the basis that the Casco Spousal Waiver was invalid
    because it was “substantially different” from the Superintendent approved waiver.  A copy of the Superintendent approved waiver
    can be found in Schedule B to these reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pierce R.S.J., in dissent, would have allowed the
    appeal and dismissed the claim on the basis that any deviations in the Casco Spousal
    Waiver were irrelevant. In her view, Mrs. Smith was bound by the Casco Spousal
    Waiver because she had signed it. Alternatively, Pierce R.S.J. held that the
    court could relieve against deviations from the prescribed form and this was an
    appropriate case for such relief.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With leave, Casco appeals to this court.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUE</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As

    Waiver that she signed?</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
    the Casco Spousal Waiver must be compared to the Superintendent approved waiver
    to determine whether there are deviations affecting the substance of the form. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, a comparison of the two waiver forms (which can be found in Schedules
    A and B to these reasons) leads to the clear conclusion that the deviations in
    the Casco Spousal Waiver affect the substance of the form.  The most significant deviation is this.  The Superintendent approved waiver makes it
    clear that entitlement to a joint and survivor pension arises from s. 44 of the<i> PBA </i>and that as a result of signing the
    waiver, entitlement to the joint and survivor pension is waived.  This message is delivered in two ways.  First, the signatories must insert the name
    of the pension plan into the sentence that says that the right to a joint and
    survivor pension flows from s. 44 of the <i>PBA</i>.  Second, there is a stand-alone statement in
    bold type, which warns that by signing the document, entitlement pursuant to s.
    44 of the <i>PBA </i>is waived.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    contrast, the Casco Spousal Waiver can be read as if the right to a joint and
    spousal pension arises both from the Casco pension plan and under s. 44 of the <i>PBA </i>and that by signing the waiver, the
    signatory waives only entitlement flowing from s. 44.  The first substantive paragraph in the Casco
    Spousal Waiver states that the signatories understand that the surviving spouse
    is entitled to a pension of 60% of the member’s pension from the pension plan.  It is important to note that this paragraph
    makes no mention of s. 44 of the <i>PBA</i>.  The statement that by signing the waiver, the
    surviving spouse will not be entitled to a joint and survivor pension provided
    by s. 44 of the <i>PBA</i> is located two
    paragraphs below.  This statement is
    immediately followed by the paragraph in which the signatory waives the right
    to receive a “survivor’s pension under Section 44 of the Act”.  Given the first substantive paragraph, which
    says that the right to a 60% joint and spousal pension arises from the pension plan,
    and the statement that by signing the waiver one gives up one’s entitlement
    flowing from s. 44 of the <i>PBA</i>, the
    Casco Spousal Waiver can be read as if the right to a joint and survivor pension
    flowing from the pension plan remains, even after the waiver has been signed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
    the purpose of the waiver is to give up all entitlement to a joint and survivor
    pension, this is a deviation of substance from the Superintendent approved
    waiver.  The deviation impairs the
    substance of the waiver in the sense that the waiver does not meet the purpose
    for which it was required – to advise that by signing the form, a person waives
    all of his or her entitlement to a joint and survivor pension.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition to this critical difference between the two waiver forms, four other differences
    between the two forms are worthy of note.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US>  The title of the forms – The Superintendent approved waiver is
    completely unambiguous.  In bold,
    capitalized letters it states “<b>WAIVER OF
    JOINT AND SURVIVOR PENSION</b>”.  It is
    clear what the document is all about.  The
    title of the Casco Waiver Form, on the other hand, does not make clear its
    purpose or nature.  The title is “<b>Pension Plan for Salaried Employees of
    Canada Starch Operating Company Inc.”</b>, followed by “(Ontario Registration
    Number: Pending)”, followed by “<b>Postretirement
    Spousal Survivor Benefit Waiver Form”.  </b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>2.</span><b><span lang=EN-US>  </span></b><span lang=EN-US>The consequences of signing the waiver – The
    Superintendent approved waiver states in bold type that by signing the waiver,
    the person is losing entitlement to any joint and survivor pension provided by
    s. 44 of the <i>PBA</i>.  The same statement is made in the Casco
    Spousal Waiver but it is not in bold type.  Further, given the substantive ambiguity in the Casco Spousal Waiver
    described above, it is not clear from reading the sentence that the consequence
    of signing is that all entitlement to a joint and survivor pension is waived.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>3.</span><span
lang=EN-US>  Independent legal advice – On the Superintendent approved waiver, the
    caution that before signing each person should consider obtaining independent
    legal advice is in bold type and immediately below the signature lines.  Both the placement of the caution and the
    fact that it is in bold type draw attention to it.  In the Casco Spousal Waiver, however, the
    caution is in regular type and forms part of the body of the document.  Consequently, the caution has no prominence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>4.</span><span
lang=EN-US>  Delivery of the form – There is a note at the bottom of the
    Superintendent approved form, in bold type, stating that the waiver is not
    effective unless delivered to a certain person and within a certain period of
    time.  This statement corresponds to the
    statutory requirement in s. 46(1) of the <i>PBA</i>.  There is no equivalent statement on the Casco
    Spousal Waiver. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    there are substantive differences between the Casco Spousal Waiver and the
    prescribed form, in my view, the Casco Spousal Waiver is invalid.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Casco
    argued that the doctrine of <i>non <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>est</span></span> factum</i> applies, with the
    result that Mrs. Smith is bound.  In my
    view, that doctrine does not apply when the legislature has provided a prescribed
    form.  Casco chose to use its own form at
    its peril.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Casco
    raised a “floodgate” alarm.  This is a
    legitimate concern.  There may be
    situations in which people have signed waivers that differ from the
    Superintendent approved waiver and are fully aware of the consequences of their
    actions.  However, as Casco points out in
    the third question that it posed for the court, there are other methods by
    which the court may relieve against the strict requirements of s. 46.  Those other arguments are not in play in this
    appeal.  To the extent that Casco raises
    estoppel, it does so for the first time on appeal.  A new defence is not to be raised at this
    stage of the proceedings, if for no other reason than the prejudice it would
    cause to Mrs. Smith given that all of the evidence is in.        </span></p>
