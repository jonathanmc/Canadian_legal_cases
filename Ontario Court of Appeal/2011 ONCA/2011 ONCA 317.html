style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The index offence committed by the appellant occurred
    in 1995 while he was on his way to his probation appointment.  It involved a 9-year-old girl who was riding
    her bike to her friend’s house.  The
    appellant pushed her to the ground, repeatedly told her not to scream, pulled
    off her shorts and underwear and began fondling her genital area.  She screamed and managed to kick him in the
    groin and break free.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 30, 1997, the appellant was found to
    be a dangerous offender.  However,
    amendments to the <i>Criminal Code</i> allowing for long-term offender
    designation came into force during the appellant’s sentencing hearing.  The hearing judge, as well as counsel,
    understood that the amendments did not apply and that the appellant was to be
    sentenced under the old provisions.  They
    were in error and this is conceded by the Crown.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    essence, the hearing judge was required, as <i>R. v. Johnson, </i>(2003),
    [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357  subsequently made clear, to consider whether the
    less restrictive long-term offender designation would suffice before making a
    dangerous offender designation.   Nevertheless, in spite of this error and the
    able submissions of Ms. Kingston, we find this to be one of the rare circumstances,
    also described in <i>Johnson</i>, where the appeal should be dismissed.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this record there is no reasonable
    possibility that the dangerous offender designation would have been different
    had the error of law not been made.  This
    result follows for three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the history of the appellant and his
    experiences with professionals, both medical and custodial, indicate clearly
    that he is not a candidate for control in the community.  Over the years he has failed to complete or
    refused to participate in some of the programming offered to him and was at
    times aggressive and violent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has been certified under the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i> and diagnosed with heterosexual paedophila, sexual sadism,
    substance abuse disorder (alcoholism) and antisocial personality disorder.  During testing, he self-reported to having
    sexual contact, including oral sex and intercourse with girls aged 12 and under
    between 21 and 50 times. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A medical professional rated the appellant as a
    100% risk to reoffend within seven years, and that he had an arousal preference
    for coercion, or non-consensual sexual scenarios with girls.  The conclusion was that the appellant
    presents a high risk to young females.  Regarding control in the community on the drug, Lupron, the medical
    opinion was: “That he would require a great deal of persuasion indeed to co-operate
    with such treatment and even then I don’t think compliance over the long run
    can be assured.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the hearing judge, in a fashion, considered
    whether the appellant could be controlled in the community.  He noted in his reasons that he had the
    discretion to impose an indeterminate sentence.  Thus, in this context he turned his mind to
    whether the appellant could be controlled in the community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Third,
    and significantly, there is no fresh evidence </span>to support a claim that
    the appellant might be a suitable candidate for a long-term offender
    designation.  Indeed, the only <span
lang=EN-GB>fresh evidence filed was in
    proceedings in 2008, which indicated that in the 11 years since the dangerous
    offender designation, there had been no change. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>For
