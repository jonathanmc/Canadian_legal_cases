  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence. Following
    a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of two counts of historical sexual
    assault and sentenced to an indeterminate period of incarceration as a
    dangerous offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Conviction Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, the appellant focussed on the
    sentence appeal. Counsel relied upon the factum with respect to the appeal
    against conviction. We dismiss that appeal for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>The trial judge did not err in admitting the facts read in on the
    appellants guilty pleas in relation to sexual offences against five other boys
    as similar fact evidence. The evidence was properly admissible to prove that
    the sexual assaults occurred. Although his reasons for concluding that the
    probative value of this evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect were
    limited, his ruling was not undermined by any legal error o</span>r
    misapprehension of material evidence and was not unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also did not err in admitting reply
    evidence by the Crown. The appellant raised the defence of alibi for the first
    time during his testimony. Given the late notice and expansive nature of the
    alibi defence, the Crown had no option but to call rebuttal evidence and did
    not improperly split its case by leading evidence that directly supported the
    allegations. Although one of the witnesses in reply made an utterance which
    corroborated a complainants evidence, the Crown could not have anticipated
    that she would do so. Neither that statement nor the testimony of the other civilian
    reply witness prejudiced the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also reject the submission that the detectives
    evidence in re-examination on reply that in his experience an accused who
    presented an alibi usually did so at the time of the investigation was an
    improper attack on the appellants credibility. It followed questions by
    defence counsel during the cross-examination about the reasonableness of the
    delay in disclosing the alibi and the right to silence. It was a brief, general
    statement to respond to the issue raised by the defence and was not oath
    attacking evidence in these circumstances. In any event, defence counsel at
    trial did not object to this evidence and did not request any form of limiting
    instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not give effect to the grounds of appeal against
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Sentence appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not dispute that he met the criteria
    for a dangerous offender designation. Rather, he submits that the sentencing
    judge erred by failing to make a long- term offender (LTO) order in place of
    the dangerous offender designation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred
    in his approach to issues involving anti-androgen medication and the role of
    the National Parole Board, and by ignoring important evidence relating to the
    reasonable possibility of the eventual control of the appellants risk in the
    community. He also seeks to admit fresh evidence regarding his suitability to
    take sex drive reducing medication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A LTO order is available only if there is a reasonable
    possibility that an offenders risk can be addressed and eventually controlled in
    the community  supervised during the currency of the LTO supervision order and
    unsupervised at the completion of the order. The statutory scheme contemplates
    a dangerous offender designation, and not a long-term offender order, where a
    sentencing judge is not satisfied that this criterion has been met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a 43-year-old acknowledged alcoholic and homosexual
    pedophile with a criminal record for nine sexual offences, the appellant poses at
    least a moderate to high risk to re-offend if released into the community.
    While the appellant has shown some willingness to deal with his problems and
    has responded well to treatment in a structured environment, he has re-offended
    each time he has been released from prison, even while on community
    supervision. The experts agreed that sex drive reducing medication, taken by a
    willing and motivated patient, as part of a treatment plan, could reduce the
    risk of re-offending. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the trial judges reasoning with
    respect to the appellants potential for treatment with sex drive reducing
    medication was tainted with legal and factual error for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge rightly understood that the parole
    board could order that a LTO take medication as prescribed by his qualified
    medical practitioner, but that a psychiatrist could not administer medication
    if consent was withdrawn either capriciously or reasonably, based upon
    potential side effects. The sentencing judge noted that a condition requiring
    an offender take medication as prescribed was not the same as a condition that would
    ensure that an offender could be released only if he was, in fact, taking the
    medication. The sentencing judge found that without the medical component of
    any treatment and release plan, the appellant was bound to re-offend. There was <span class=GramE>ample  evidence</span> to support such a finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge did not materially misapprehend
    the process or the ability of the parole board to deal with any breach of a LTO
    condition. It may well be possible to fashion a condition to ensure that the
    appellant could be released only if taking the medication as initially
    recommended by a psychiatrist. However, the sentencing judge recognized that
    there are many factors which independently make the successful enforcement of a
    condition requiring that the appellant continue to take medication problematic.
    The sentencing judge found that he lacked reasonable assurance that the medical
    component of the controls would be implemented and enforced. Further, the
    appellant would not be found in breach of such a condition under s. 753.3(1) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>if he had a reasonable excuse
    for refusing to take the prescribed medication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>In these circumstances, the sentencing judge did not err by focussing </span>on
    whether the appellant would consent to take the medication. The evidence of the
    appellants attitude towards treatment was a factor that was highly relevant to
    the assessment of risk. Given the circumstances of this case, where the risk is
    created by a life-long condition, and controlling the risk is premised to a
    significant extent, if not entirely, upon the appellants willingness and
    capacity to take the medication, both during the currency of and potentially following
    the expiry of any LTO supervision order, the judge was appropriately concerned
    with whether the evidence specific to this offender demonstrated a sufficient motivation,
    commitment, and capacity to take the medication on an ongoing basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The sentencing
    judge did not ignore evidence of the appellants motivation for change. The
    appellant had responded well to programs while incarcerated and had expressed a
    willingness to take the medication to his defence expert. Nonetheless, the
    appellant did not testify and there was limited evidence regarding the
    appellants willingness and capacity to take the medication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the sentencing judge found that the
    evidence that the appellant could be treated with sex drive reducing medication
    amounted merely to hope and speculation that his risk to children could be
    controlled if he were released back into the community. Reading the reasons as
    a whole, it is clear that the sentencing judge understood and applied the
    correct test of whether there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control
    in the community of the appellants risk to re-offend. He made no error in
    principle and his findings were supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the fresh evidence provides further evidence
    of the appellants physiological suitability to start the medication and of his
    taking of test doses, it does not go far enough to demonstrate his suitability
    and his genuine motivation to do so, particularly on a longer term basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the additional evidence related to the
    side-effects of the medication, the evidence is clear that both the
    side-effects and patient tolerance of the side-effects are highly variable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the appellant did not provide an affidavit as
    part of the fresh evidence application, nor, other than the test doses, has he
    begun actually taking the medication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, the appellants risk is created by a
    life-long condition and controlling that risk is premised almost entirely upon
    his willingness and capacity to take the medication on a long-term basis. In
    the circumstances, in our view, the fresh evidence simply does not go far
    enough to demonstrate the appellants motivation, commitment, and capacity to
    take the medication on an ongoing basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we not satisfied that the fresh evidence
    could reasonably have affected the outcome of the dangerous offender application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, we conclude that the sentencing judge did
    not err in declaring the appellant to be a dangerous offender or in finding
    that he did not meet the criteria for a long-term offender designation. The
