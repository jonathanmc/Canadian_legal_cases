  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal requires the court to consider, for the
    first time, whether independent contractors are to be counted when determining
    whether an employer must establish and maintain a joint health and safety
    committee pursuant to s. 9 of the <i>Occupational
    Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (the “<i>OHSA”</i>). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>United Independent Operators Limited (“UIOL”) is a load
    broker.   Customers contract with it to
    transport aggregate (sand, gravel and crushed stone).  In turn, UIOL contracts with truck drivers –
    who independently own and operate their trucks – to pick up the aggregate from
    quarries, gravel pits and construction sites and transport it to locations where
    UIOL’s customers need it.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 9(2)(a) of the <i>OHSA </i>requires a joint health and safety committee (“JHSC”) “at a
    workplace at which 20 or more workers are regularly employed”.  The question raised on this appeal is whether
    the independent truck owner/operators (“truck drivers”) are “regularly
    employed” within the meaning of s. 9(2)(a).     <span> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I will explain, it is my view that they are.     </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>UIOL’s sole business premises are in Woodbridge,
    Ontario.  They consist of a reception
    area, a lunch room and seven offices (the “UIOL office”).  On July 24, 2004, there were eleven employees
    working at the UIOL office.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The number of truck drivers working for UIOL ranges
    from 30 to 140, depending on the time of year.  When hauling for UIOL, the trucks must bear the UIOL corporate banner so
    that they are readily identifiable by UIOL customers as being part of the
    contracted haulage service.  UIOL pays
    the truck drivers based on an agreed price per ton of material transported or
    by the trip.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To work for UIOL, a truck driver must attend at the UIOL
    office and give various documents to Ms. Sandra Upshaw, the Safety and
    Owner/Operator Administrator.  The documentation
    includes such things as a Record of Vehicle Weight, a Certificate of
    Competency, an Operating License, a Commercial Vehicle Operator Registration
    Certificate, a Certificate of Insurance, a Driver’s License, and a WSIB
    Certificate or Clearance Certificate.  The candidate then obtains and completes an application form. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once UIOL receives all the necessary documentation, it
    screens the candidate.  If the candidate
    is accepted, he or she returns for an orientation session that lasts for approximately
    an hour and a half. This session includes a page-by-page review of the company
    handbook, the presentation of a safety video, a quiz on the content of the
    video, and a meeting with the UIOL dispatcher. The company handbook specifies
    the truck driver’s duties, and includes direction on daily responsibilities,
    procedures to be followed in the quarries, what the truck drivers should wear,
    and how they should generally operate when working for UIOL. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After orientation is complete, the truck driver can be
    dispatched by UIOL. There are two dispatchers at the UIOL office.  They decide which truck drivers will be
    dispatched, and they tell the truck drivers where to pick up their loads.  Truck drivers must call the office each day
    between 3 and 5pm to find out where they have been assigned.  Although truck drivers are permitted to turn
    down a dispatch opportunity, this occurs only between 3 and 4% of the time.  When truck drivers have a health or safety
    concern, they are to call the UIOL dispatcher.  If customers have concerns in respect of a truck driver, they must raise
    the matter with staff at the UIOL office. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The truck drivers spend the bulk of their time working
    at various pits and quarries that are not owned by UIOL. They own their own
    trucks and pay all associated expenses, including insurance, fuel, repairs,
    tires, tolls and traffic tickets. Most truck drivers also own their trailers,
    although some rent trailers from UIOL.  They
    must own a hard hat, safety boots, reflective vest and wheel chocks and they must
    sign a form saying that they own these items or have purchased them from UIOL.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are no written employment contracts between the truck
    drivers and UIOL.  No statutory
    deductions – for income tax, CPP, EI or otherwise – are made from payments to
    the truck drivers.  UIOL does not pay for
    Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (“WSIB”) coverage for the truck drivers nor
    does it give them Records of Employment when the working relationship is terminated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Truck drivers attend at the UIOL office approximately
    twice per month to drop off load sheets or weigh tickets for processing and to secure
    payment for the haulage services they have provided.  They frequently receive safety information
    when picking up their cheques.  Truck
    drivers must keep detailed “run sheets”, setting out the work that they have completed.
    They have a space at the UIOL office, called the drivers’ room, in which they
    can fill out the run sheets. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Truck drivers are periodically required to attend
    health and safety meetings, some of which are held at the UIOL office and some
    of which are held offsite. UIOL also conducts safety meetings with those of its
    employees who exercise managerial functions.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ministry of Labour became involved with UIOL when
    Amrik Singh, a truck driver who worked for UIOL, was crushed between his truck
    and that of another UIOL truck driver.  He
    suffered a broken pelvis and two broken legs. The accident occurred at the
    worksite of a UIOL customer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While investigating the accident, the Ministry of Labour
    formed the view that UIOL had contravened the Act by failing to establish and
    maintain a JHSC.  It issued an order
    requiring UIOL to establish a JHSC (the “Order”).  UIOL disputed its obligation to have such a
    committee, arguing that it had only 11 full time employees and that the truck
    drivers were not “regularly employed” by it.  UIOL pointed out that the truck drivers were not in an employment
    relationship with it and that they had been held to be independent contractors
    by the WSIB, Revenue Canada and the Ministry of Labour, Employment Standards
    Branch.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, UIOL complied with the Order by establishing
    and maintaining a JHSC.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Despite
    UIOL’s compliance with the Order, charges were laid against it for having
    failed to have such a committee in July 2004, when Mr. Singh was injured.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>A trial
    was conducted before Justice of the Peace James E. Oates.  He acquitted UIOL.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In finding
    that UIOL was not required to establish and maintain a JHSC, the trial judge </span>relied
    heavily on <i>526093 Ontario Inc. (c.o.b.
    Taxi Taxi)</i>, [2000] O.O.H.S.A.D. No. 98 (QL) (“<i>Taxi Taxi</i>”), a decision of the Ontario Labour Relations Board, in
    which “regularly employed” was held to apply only to workers who have a traditional
    employment relationship with their employers.  The trial judge concluded that the facts in the present case and those
    in <i>Taxi Taxi</i> were virtually
    identical.  He listed the following
    points of similarity:  all of UIOL’s truck
    drivers are independent owner/operators; UIOL does not own any of the trucks;
    UIOL is, in effect, a dispatch business; the truck drivers pay UIOL a fee for
    its dispatch services; the truck drivers pay all taxes, fees, and tolls; the
    truck drivers arrange and pay for WSIB coverage; and, the truck drivers do not
    operate physically from the UIOL office, going to it only to submit the
    paperwork necessary to be paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ministry of Labour appealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Peter Tetley, of the Ontario Court of Justice,
    dismissed the appeal.  Like the trial
    judge, he was of the view that UIOL was under no obligation to establish a
    JHSC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal court judge acknowledged that the <i>OHSA</i> must be interpreted in a broad manner
    consistent with its legislative purpose but held that the trial judge made no error
    in relying on the <i>Taxi Taxi</i> decision.  He accepted the conclusion in <i>Taxi Taxi </i>that the mandatory committee
    structure imposed by s. 9(2)(a) is consistent with an environment in which an
    employer has regular employees who perform work in its workplace.  Like the trial judge, he accepted that the
    word “employed” in s. 9(2)(a) refers to a traditional employment relationship.  He held that the truck drivers are not
    employed in the traditional sense because they: are entitled to refuse the
    employment opportunities that UIOL offers them; can work for themselves or
    someone else; own and maintain their own vehicles; commonly structure their
    trucking services as independent businesses.  In the circumstances, he found “it is difficult to conclude that they
    were ‘regularly employed’ by UIOL.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once more, the Ministry of Labour appeals.    </p>

    in s. 9(2)(a) of the <i>OHSA</i>.  The interpretation of legislation is a

    employment relationship does not exist between them and UIOL.  Thus, in his view, the truck drivers were not
    “regularly employed” for the purpose of determining whether the threshold of 20
    workers in s. 9(2)(a) had been met.  </span></p>

    or customary for UIOL to have between 30 and 140 truck drivers working for

    meaning of s. 9(2)(a) by requiring JHSCs only if 20 or more workers regularly
    work “at a workplace”, that is, if twenty or more workers regularly work at a
    particular workplace location.  Arguably,
    this would mean that s. 9(2)(a) would not apply to the many different dispersed
    and extended workplaces in Ontario, thereby depriving workers in such
    situations of the protections afforded by a JHSC.  There is nothing in the legislation to

    employers face in establishing and maintaining JHSCs when their workforce consists
    of independent contractors, who often work on their own timetables and for a
    number of employers.  For example, an

    Sarnia.  A number of the employees
    associated with the warehouse were drivers.  They had a home base to which they reported for instructions,

    Ontario.   They form an integral part of the internal
    responsibility system, the underlying philosophy of the <i>OHSA.  </i>The concept of an

    to the [OHSA] is the concept that employers and workers must share
    responsibility for occupational health and safety and that both must actively
    seek to identify hazards and develop responses to protect workers.  This internal responsibility system assumes
    assessment of the system itself by employers and workers through the
    appointment of health and safety committees and representatives and through
    regular inspections of the workplace.  </span></p>

    broad purpose must inform the interpretation of s. 9(2)(a) which requires the
    establishment of a JHSC, an important mechanism in achieving the legislative
    objective of enhanced worker safety.  </span></p>

    the words “regularly employed” to include the truck drivers makes sense
    contextually and supports the purpose of the legislation.  Conversely, reading in a requirement that s.
    9(2)(a) applies only to workplaces in which workers are in a traditional
    employment relationship with their employers would seriously curtail the scope
    of s. 9(2)(a) and limit the number of JHSCs that must be established and
    maintained.  The narrow interpretation
    would interfere with the attainment of the purpose of the <i>OHSA</i>.  It must be rejected in
    favour of the interpretation that does no violence to the plain meaning of the
    words “regularly employed” and that promotes worker safety, the purpose of the
    legislation.</span></p>

    final comment is in order.  Section
    9(2)(a) specifies that a JHSC is required “at a workplace” at which twenty or
    more workers are regularly employed.  This appeal decides that the truck drivers are workers who are
    “regularly employed”.  UIOL has conceded
    throughout that the UIOL office is a “workplace” as defined in the <i>OHSA</i>.  However, the question of whether the truck drivers are regularly employed
    “<u>at</u> a workplace” (emphasis added) was not decided in the courts below
    nor was it argued before us.  Thus,
    deciding the matter in issue on this appeal has not finally decided whether the
    offence has been made out.    </span></p>

    rather than order a new trial, I would order a stay of proceedings.  UIOL promptly complied with the Order and
    established a JHSC.  It has maintained
    that committee.  Thus, this proceeding is
    moot insofar as UIOL is concerned.  The
    question of law decided by this appeal was novel and to the extent there was
    guidance on the point, <i>Taxi Taxi </i>favoured
    UIOL’s position that it was not required to have a JHSC.  UIOL has gone through a trial and two
    appeals, at considerable expense.  In the
    circumstances, it is not in the public interest to order a second trial nor does
    the due administration of justice demand one.    </span></p>

    57(1) of the <i>OHSA </i>empowers an
    inspector appointed under the <i>OHSA </i>to
    issue an order when the inspector finds that a section of the <i>OHSA </i>is being contravened.  Under s. 61 of the <i>OHSA</i>, an appeal from such an order lies to an occupational health
    and safety adjudicator appointed under s. 20(1).  Both <i>Taxi
    Taxi </i>and <i>Brewers Retail </i>came
    before the OLRB as a result of an appeal from an inspector’s order, pursuant to
    s. 61 of the <i>OHSA</i>.  </p>
