  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Ragavan</span> <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> is a Canadian citizen.  He has appealed
    an order committing him for extradition and applied for judicial review of the
    Justice Minister’s order surrendering him to the United States to face fraud
    charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts giving rise to these proceedings are
    unusual.  In February 2007, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> was arrested and charged in Ontario with multiple
    counts of fraud contrary to the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  The Crown alleged that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> participated in a fraudulent telemarketing scheme
    operating from Canada and targeting elderly residents living in the United
    States.  His lawyer and the Crown
    prosecutor reached a plea agreement to resolve all of these charges.  The agreement was vetted and approved by a
    judge of the Ontario Court of Justice.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> was set to plead guilty and be
    sentenced on July 24, 2009.  Had that
    happened, no extradition proceedings could have been taken against him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> case
    did not go forward on July 24.  Because
    of a clerical error, the information on which he was to plead went astray.  His case was adjourned to September 2, 2009
    so that <span class=GramE>a replacement</span> information could be issued.  On August 31, two days before Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> was again set to plead guilty, the Ontario
    prosecutor handling the case learned that back in June the Minister of Justice
    had issued an authority to <span class=GramE>proceed</span> seeking Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> extradition to the United States for the same
    conduct that founded the Ontario charges.  On September 2, the Crown prosecutor stayed the Ontario charges so that
    the extradition proceedings could go forward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the extradition judge, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> accepted that the evidence against him was sufficient to warrant his
    committal.  But he argued that staying
    the domestic charges rendered the extradition proceedings an abuse of
    process.  He asked that those proceedings
    be stayed.  The extradition judge did not
    accept this argument and committed Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> for
    extradition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the Minister, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> renewed his abuse of process argument and also argued that surrendering him to
    the United States would unjustifiably violate his constitutional right to
    remain in Canada under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The Minister rejected both arguments and
    ordered his surrender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> made essentially the same arguments that he had made before the extradition
    judge and the Minister.  I see no merit
    in the abuse of process argument.  However, in assessing Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> claim of an
    unjustified violation of s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the Minister failed to take account of the unusual facts of this case.  I would set aside the Minister’s surrender
    order and remit the matter to him for reconsideration.  </p>

    about $2 million.</span></p>

    fraud and would have received a sentence of two years less a day to be served
    conditionally plus two years probation.  He would also have been subject to a restitution order of $200,000.  On July 24, 2009, Horkins J. of the Ontario
    Court of Justice approved the agreement and was ready to take Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> plea.  The

    mid-May 2009, the United States sent Canada a diplomatic note requesting Mr. <span

    commit fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud.  On June 23, 2009, the Minister of Justice issued an authority to proceed
    for the corresponding Canadian offence of fraud.</span></p>

    extradition judge dismissed the stay application and committed Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> for extradition.  He found no evidence the provincial Crown knew of the extradition
    proceedings before August 31, 2009.  He
    also found that the Ontario prosecutorial authorities had acted in good
    faith.  Therefore, their decision to stay
    the domestic charges was not improper.  </span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Minister’s surrender order</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 15, 2010, having considered Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> submissions, the Minister of Justice ordered his
    surrender to the United States.  The
    Minister of Justice also found no abuse of process in staying the domestic
    charges.  He held that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> had no right to plead guilty in Canada, and merely
    because he faced a longer sentence in the United States was not a reason to
    refuse his surrender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister also held that surrendering Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> to the United States would not unjustifiably violate
    his constitutional right under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i> to remain in Canada.  The Minister did a “<span class=SpellE><i>Cotroni</i></span> assessment” and concluded that surrender for
    prosecution in the United States was “the most effective and appropriate option.”</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But for the error in the court office, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> would have received a conditional sentence of two
    years less a day.  He now faces the
    prospect of a sentence of more than 15 years in prison.  As severe as that may be, the mere
    possibility that a Canadian citizen may face a much higher sentence if
    extradited does not turn a stay of the domestic proceedings in favour of
    extradition into an abuse of process:  see <i>Whitley</i> <i>v. USA </i>(1994) 20 O.R. (3d) 794 (C.A.), <span
class=SpellE>aff’d</span> [1996] 1 S.C.R. 467.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> abuse of process
    argument must rest on showing that, in exercising their discretion to stay the
    domestic charges, the Ontario prosecutors acted in bad faith or for improper
    motives.  Trafford J. made no finding of
    bad faith or improper motives.  And there
    is no evidence to support such a finding.  Thus, both the extradition judge and the Minister were correct to reject
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> claim of abuse of process.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In determining that extradition
    did not unjustifiably violate Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> s. 6(1)
    rights, the Minister of Justice failed to consider the unusual facts of this
    case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i> every Canadian citizen has the right to remain in
    Canada.  In <i>USA v. <span class=SpellE>Cotroni</span></i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469, the
    Supreme Court of Canada held that extradition is a <i>prima facie</i> infringement of the right guaranteed by s. 6(1), but is
    justified under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Nonetheless, in a particular case, depending
    on the facts, the extradition of a Canadian citizen to face charges abroad may
    amount to an unjustified infringement of that <span class=GramE>citizen’s s.
    6(1) rights</span>.  Whether it does is
    for the Minister to decide:  see <i>USA v. Kwok</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 532.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Typically the Minister must decide whether prosecution
    in Canada is a realistic option: see <span class=SpellE><i>Controni</i></span> at 1498:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Of course, the authorities must give due weight to
    the constitutional right of a citizen to remain in Canada.  They must in good faith direct their minds to
    whether prosecution would be equally effective in Canada, given the existing
    domestic laws and international cooperative arrangements.  They have an obligation flowing from s. 6(1)
    to assure themselves that prosecution in Canada is not a realistic option.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister’s decision is discretionary.  In exercising that discretion, the Minister
    invariably considers some or all of the factors approved of by La Forest J.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The weighing and balancing of these factors have come
    to be known as a “<span class=SpellE><i>Cotroni</i></span> assessment”.  Because a <span
class=SpellE><i>Cotroni</i></span> assessment involves the exercise of discretion, the Minister’s decision whether
    to surrender a Canadian citizen for extradition is entitled to deference from a
    reviewing court.  A court should
    interfere with the Minister’s decision only if it is unreasonable:  see <i>USA
    v. Lake</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761, at para. 34. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, before deferring to the Minister’s decision,
    the court must be satisfied that the Minister carried out a proper
    analysis.  And a proper analysis requires
    consideration of the relevant facts.  <span
class=SpellE>LeBel</span> J. made this point writing for the court in <i>Lake</i> at para. 41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=QuoteChar><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
font-style:normal'>The reviewing court’s role is not to re-assess the relevant
    factors and substitute its own view.  Rather,
    the court must determine whether the Minister’s decision falls within a range
    of reasonable outcomes.  To apply this
    standard in the extradition context, a court must ask whether the Minister
    considered the relevant facts and reached a defensible conclusion based on
    those facts.  I agree with Laskin J.A.
    that the Minister must, in reaching his decision, apply the correct legal
    test.  The Minister’s conclusion will not
    be rational or defensible if he has failed to carry out the proper
    analysis.  If, however, the Minister has
    identified the proper test, the conclusion he has reached in applying that test
    should be upheld by a reviewing court unless it is unreasonable.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the part of his reasons dealing with the abuse of
    process argument, the Minister does refer to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> submission on the plea agreement.  He
    even recognizes that this submission is closely tied to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> argument on s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Unfortunately, however, the Minister does not
    say anything more about this submission other than to observe that it can be
    considered by this court on the appeal from the committal order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, there is nothing in the Minister’s reasons to
    show that he considered the plea agreement or the unusual facts of this case
    when he rejected Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> s. 6(1) argument.  According to <span class=SpellE><i>Cotroni</i></span>, the Minister is required
    to consider whether prosecution in Canada is a realistic option.  Three of the <span class=SpellE><i>Cotroni</i></span> factors to be weighed and
    assessed are “which jurisdiction has laid charges,” “which jurisdiction is
    ready to <span class=GramE>proceed</span> to trial,” and “the severity of the
    sentence the accused is likely to receive in each jurisdiction.”  Obviously, prosecution in Canada was a
    realistic option.  Charges were laid and
    successfully resolved.  Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span> would have been sentenced to two years less a day to
    be served in the community.  Now he faces
    a sentence of 15 years to be served in prison.  The harsher sentence that he now faces is a factor that militates
    against surrender:  <i>U.S.A. v. <span class=SpellE>Ferras</span>; U.S.A. v. <span
class=SpellE>Latty</span></i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 77, at para. 86.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the plea agreement and the unusual facts that
    precluded it from being implemented together with the disparity in sentences in
    the two jurisdictions are relevant to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> s.
    6(1) argument.  However, instead of
    adverting to these facts and especially to the plea agreement, which, but for
    the information having gone astray would have put an end to the extradition
    proceedings, the Minister simply said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As Minister of Justice acting under section 40 of
    the Act, my role in the extradition process is essentially political in nature
    (<i>United States v. Kwok</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Lake v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, <i>supra</i>).  As such, I will not
    interfere with the exercise of discretion not to prosecute Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby</span>, nor do I have the authority to direct the relevant
    investigative authorities to pursue an investigation or lay charges against
    him.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>And:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on the fact that charges were originally laid
    in Canada, there can be no doubt that a Canadian prosecution was possible in
    this case.  I accept the finding of the
    extradition judge that the Canadian authorities properly exercised their
    discretion to stay Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> domestic charges in
    favour of prosecution in the United States.  I can see nothing improper in these circumstances in this matter being
    prosecuted in the United States and I am particularly mindful that the crucial
    evidence of the elderly victims is located in the United States.  The Canadian evidence, though considerable,
    consists primarily of seized records and the evidence of the Canadian
    investigators and is more easily transportable to another jurisdiction for
    trial than is the evidence of the alleged victims.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> was
    arrested in Canada and charged, there are no Canadian criminal proceedings
    pending against him.  By contrast, there
    are charges pending against Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> in the United
    States District Court for the Southern District of Texas and his extradition
    has been sought from Canada.  In the
    absence of charges against Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> in Canada, in
    my view, the principles enunciated in <span class=SpellE><i>Cotroni</i></span>, <i>supra</i>,
    applied to the facts of this case combined with Canada’s treaty obligations
    make surrender for prosecution in the United States the most effective and
    appropriate option in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, these reasons include a considerable
    amount of boiler plate language but very little about Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> actual circumstances and, as I have already mentioned, they say nothing about
    the plea agreement that was reached with the Ontario prosecutors, approved by
    an Ontario judge and set to be implemented.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether these circumstances ought to dictate a
    different result is not for me to say. Certainly, the Minister identified some
    relevant considerations warranting surrender, such as the harm having occurred
    to elderly victims in the United States. But Mr. <span class=SpellE>Thamby</span> is entitled to have the Minister weigh all of the relevant considerations
    favouring a domestic prosecution when exercising his discretion whether to make
    a surrender order.  From Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Thamby’s</span> perspective, the extradition proceedings were
    unexpected, occurred at the very last moment and yet may have an enormous
    impact on his life.  On these unusual
    facts he is entitled to know why he cannot conclude his plea agreement in
    Canada.</p>
