    he was underpaying support.” He concluded, based on the expert testimony of

    child of two spouses or former spouses who, at the material time, ... is of the

    representing herself, had tried with little success to obtain financial
    disclosure from the husband with a view to making a claim for retroactive child
    and spousal support.  Moreover, and
    importantly, she made an application for these categories of relief on August
    30, 2007.  It is true that she did not
    cite the <i>Divorce Act</i> or any other
    statute in this application.  However, I
    hardly regard this omission as fatal in the context of a self-represented
    litigant doing her best to complete the relevant application document.  Accordingly, I conclude that the relevant
    date for determining whether TC was a “child of the marriage” within the
    meaning of s. 2(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b) of the <i>Divorce Act</i> is August 30, 2007.</span></p>

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>[W]<span class=SpellE>hile</span> the meaning

    parent is an act performed by the child. The word “charge” may be somewhat
    ambiguous, but I am quite sure that as used in s.&nbsp;2(1) of the <i>Act</i>, it is intended to be an economic
    term.  To be in the charge of a parent
    means, as s. 15.1 <span class=GramE>says,</span> that a parent pays for the

    agree with his critique. Under the Separation Agreement, the husband had an
    obligation of “full disclosure … in all significant matters affecting the

    significant reductions in his child support payments without disclosing to the
    wife his exercise of valuable stock options, his receipt of generous severance
    packages, the fact and effect of his rare book donations to the University of

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>Lest I be interpreted as discouraging

    the <span class=SpellE>payor</span> parent chose to bring that unpredictability

Once the <span class=SpellE>payor</span> parent engages in such conduct, there can be no claim that (s<span class=GramE>)he</span> reasonably believed his/her child’s support entitlement was being met. This
    will not only be the case where the <span class=SpellE>payor</span> parent
    intimidates and lies to the recipient parent, but also where (s<span

    increase in income that one would expect to alter the amount of child support
    payable – is itself blameworthy conduct.  The presence of such blameworthy conduct will move the presumptive date
    of retroactivity back to the time when circumstances changed materially.  A <span class=SpellE>payor</span> parent
    cannot use his/her informational advantage to justify his/her deficient child

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the fact that the parties revisited the
    Separation Agreement upon a moderate change in the husband’s income can be seen
    to reflect the parties’ intention in relation to the circumstances under which
    variation would be appropriate.  Given
    the husband’s request to revisit the terms of the Separation Agreement when his
    income level changed, he must accept that the same type of change justifies a
    variation in the wife’s favour.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clause 8 of the Separation Agreement states
    that, “it is the parties’ expectation that within a reasonable period of time,
    the wife’s income will increase, commensurate with her experience”.  In fact, the wife’s income <i>decreased </i>from 1997 to 1998 and did not
    rally until 2004.   The wife’s low income
    during this period can easily be viewed as <span style='color:black'>causally
    connected to the marriage given that the wife was out of the work-force from
    the birth of the first child until the date of separation 13 years later.  Causal connection to the marriage is not
    required for a finding of material change, but it certainly strengthens the
    case for variation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>Moreover, as set out by

    proper variation of child support where a mother’s income increases takes into
    account the needs of the children as well as the increased income of the wife. An
    increase in the mother’s income could very well lead to a conclusion that
    although the amount of spousal support should be reduced, the amount of child
    support should be commensurately raised in order to address realistically the
    situation of the family and the fact that child support had previously been
    understated because of its interrelationship with the means of the <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the years in question, it is appropriate for the amount of the child support to
    more closely reflect the means and standard of living of the <span

    and his decision to accordingly award child support arrears in excess of those
    specified under the Separation Agreement and instead in accordance with the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>.  The application judge explicitly accepted the
    report of the husband’s income prepared by the wife’s expert, Andrew Freedman
    of Cole Valuation Partners Limited, and calculated the amount of child support

    2007.  It seems to me that by 2004, the

    2003 on the basis that at that point the wife’s income reached a level whereby
    she was self-sufficient, we assume that he viewed the dip in the wife’s income

    context of determining spousal support where the separation agreement provides
    a release.  At <span class=SpellE>paras</span>.
    90 and 91, the court states:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court's focus should be on the agreement's
    continued correspondence to the parties' original intentions as to their
    relative positions and the overall objectives of the Act, not on whether a
    change occurred <i>per se</i>. That is to say, we do not consider
    &quot;change&quot; of any particular nature to be a threshold requirement
    which, once established, entitles the court to jettison the agreement entirely.
    Rather, the court should be persuaded that both the intervention and the degree
    of intervention are warranted. That is, at this stage, even if unbending
    enforcement of the agreement is inappropriate, that agreement may still
    indicate to a trial judge the parties' understanding of their relationship and
    their intentions. Even an agreement that is not determinative as a result of
    the parties' circumstances at the time of the application warrants compulsory
    consideration under s. 15.2(4).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although we recognize the unique nature of
    separation agreements and their differences from commercial contracts, they are
    contracts nonetheless. Parties must take responsibility for the contract they
    execute as well as for their own lives. It is only where the current
    circumstances represent a significant departure from the range of reasonable
    outcomes anticipated by the parties, in a manner that puts them at odds with
    the objectives of the Act, that the court may be persuaded to give the
    agreement little weight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause 8(6) of the Separation Agreement provides for

    change whatsoever, even if it be material, profound, catastrophic, radical or

    in the opening words of clause 8 of the agreement, the wife acknowledged that
    she has completed her course and obtained employment as a law clerk.  The parties expressed their expectation that
    within a reasonable period of time, the wife’s income would increase.  This, in fact, took place during the exact
    period of time the parties contemplated would be required when they signed the
    agreement.  The subsequent temporary
    set-back does not, in our view, amount to a “significant departure from the
    range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties”, particularly in the
    light of the wording of clause 8, to which both parties, represented by
    experienced counsel, agreed.  That
    wording makes it clear that a “financial reversal”, even one that is “catastrophic”
    provides no right to obtain spousal support beyond that which is provided for

    basis that she was able to demonstrate a material change in circumstances. </span></p>

    acknowledged that no material change, even one that may be regarded as
    “profound, catastrophic, radical or otherwise, will give the other the right to
    claim or obtain spousal support, except to the extent provided for the wife in

    guidelines, as opposed to the amounts set out in the Separation Agreement.  We do not view this as a contradiction.  The jurisprudence is clear that while the
    court should respect the parties’ agreement when it comes to spousal support,
    in dealing with child support the court may step in. This is particularly true
    where, as here, the child support agreed upon deviated significantly from the
