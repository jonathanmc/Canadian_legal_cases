  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question to be decided on this appeal is whether Gordon
    Creber is entitled to an unreduced pension at age 62.  The answer to that question lies in
    interpreting the terms of the registered pension plan of which he was a member
    and the executive supplementary pension agreement to which he was a party.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Creber began working for Revios Canada Ltd. on
    October 1, 1998, as Vice President, Corporate Actuarial.  He worked for Revios until February 28, 2006,
    when his employment was terminated.  At
    the time of termination, he held the position of Senior Vice President and
    Chief Financial Officer.  He was 52 years
    old.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While employed by Revios, Mr. Creber was a member of
    its registered pension plan (the Plan).  He also entered into an Executive Supplementary Pension Agreement (ESPA).  Because the Plan is limited by the provisions
    of the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 (5<sup>th</sup> Supp.), c. 1, in terms of the quantum of benefits it can pay to members, the
    ESPA is designed to “top up” benefits on retirement.  That is, its principal purpose is to provide
    for pension benefits supplementary to, and in excess of, the benefits provided
    by the Plan.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Revios started an action in which it sought a
    declaration that Mr. Creber was not entitled to an unreduced pension at age 62
    under either the Plan or the ESPA.  Mr.
    Creber defended the action and counterclaimed against Revios.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Creber brought a motion for summary judgment.  Since there were no material facts in dispute,
    with the parties’ agreement, the motion judge disposed not only of the motion
    but also the core question raised in the action.  By judgment dated September 23, 2010, Pollack
    J. dismissed the motion for summary judgment and declared that Mr. Creber is
    not entitled to an unreduced pension at age 62 under either the Plan or the
    ESPA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Creber appeals.  He contends that the Plan and ESPA, when properly interpreted, give him
    the right to an unreduced pension at age 62.  His submission hinges on art. 2.1(A.2) of the ESPA and s. 8.04 of the
    Plan, both of which are set out below, along with the other relevant provisions
    in the two documents.  He argues that
    “early retirement” is not defined in either the Plan or the ESPA and,
    therefore, the reference in art. 2.1(A.2) of the ESPA to “early retirement” can
    be linked to s. 8.04 of the Plan, with the result that he is entitled to
    receive an unreduced pension at age 62.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Initially, Mr. Creber also claimed entitlement to
    enhanced early retirement benefits if he began receiving his pension at age 55.  However, at the oral hearing of the appeal,
    counsel for Mr. Creber conceded that Mr. Creber did not meet the eligibility
    conditions for such benefits and so abandoned that part of his claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>THE ISSUE</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the motion judge’s interpretation of the pension
    documents, Mr. Creber is not entitled to an unreduced pension at age 62.  The issue on appeal is whether the motion
    judge erred in that interpretation.</p>

    is entitled to receive a deferred pension payable in equal monthly instalments

    in Section 6.01. The Member may elect to have the pension commence before his
    Normal Retirement Date, on the first day of any calendar month on or following
    his early retirement date. If the pension commencement date is on or following
    the first day of the month coincident with or next following the Member’s attainment
    of age 62, the pension will not be reduced for early commencement. Otherwise,
    the pension will be reduced by one-third of one per cent for each month that
    the pension commencement date precedes the first day of the month coincident
    with or next following the Member’s attainment of age 62, provided however that
    in no event shall the reduction of the pension be less than the most favourable

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principles governing the interpretation of contracts
    are well known.  The overriding goal is to
    give effect to the intention to the parties, as expressed in the written
    agreements: see <i>BG Checo International
    Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro &amp; Power Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12,
    at para. 9 (<i>BG Checo</i>).  Absent ambiguity, the words in the documents are
    to be given their plain meaning: see <i>Eli
    Lilly &amp; Co. v. Novopharm Ltd</i>.; <i>Eli
    Lilly &amp; Co. v. Apotex Inc</i>., [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, at para. 55.  And, the various provisions are not to be
    interpreted in isolation.  Rather, they
    are to be interpreted in a manner that takes the entire agreement into account:
    see <i>BG Checo</i>, at para. 9.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With these principles in mind, it is clear that in
    determining Mr. Creber’s entitlement, the court must begin by considering the
    Plan provisions.  Contrary to the
    submission of counsel for the appellant, the ESPA and the Plan are not “stand
    alone” documents.  Rather, the ESPA is supplementary
    to the Plan as is evident from its title as a “supplementary” pension agreement
    and the third recital, which states that its purpose is to set out the terms
    and conditions relating to pension benefits “in excess of the benefits provided
    under the [Plan]”.  The fact that the
    ESPA is supplementary to the Plan is reinforced by art.1.1 of the ESPA, which
    defines the terms used in the ESPA by reference to the Plan.  For example, art. 1.1(d) of the ESPA defines
    “Pension Plan Benefits” as the pension benefits payable to the Employee
    pursuant to the Plan and art. 1.2 stipulates that “[a]ll other terms used in [the
    ESPA] shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the [Plan]”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin, therefore, with the Plan provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan is structured with normal retirement to take
    place at age 65 (s. 5.01) and early retirement to occur when a Plan member’s
    employment ends within ten years of his or her normal retirement date – that
    is, when the Plan member is between the ages of 55 and 65 (s. 5.02).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general, entitlement on normal retirement is 2% of
    final average earnings multiplied by credited service (s. 6.01).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A person who takes early retirement is entitled to a deferred
    pension commencing at age 65 (s. 6.02).  Alternatively, he or she may elect to have the deferred pension commence
    prior to age 65.  If the deferred pension
    commences at age 62, the pension will not be reduced, otherwise if he or she
    commences taking the deferred pension before age 62, it will be reduced by &#8531;
    of 1% for each month that the  commencement
    date precedes the member’s attainment of age 62 (s. 6.02). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Creber’s entitlement to benefits under the Plan is
    governed by s. 8.01(2) because: (1) he accrued benefits for post-1995 service;
    (2) his employment was terminated after more than 24 months of continuous service
    while a member of the Plan; and (3) he was not eligible to retire under s. 5 of
    the Plan.  Mr. Creber was not eligible to
    retire under s. 5 of the Plan because s. 5 governs normal and early retirement,
    as we have seen.  Because Mr. Creber was
    only 52 when his employment with Revios ended, he did not meet the early
    retirement age requirement (between the ages of 55 and 65) nor did he meet the
    normal retirement age requirement (age 65).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 8.01(2), Mr. Creber was entitled to a
    deferred pension, commencing at his “Normal Retirement Date” (i.e. when he
    turned 65).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, s. 8.04 enables Mr. Creber to begin to receive
    his deferred pension early.  Because he
    is entitled to receive a deferred pension pursuant to s. 8 of the Plan, he
    could elect to begin receiving his pension at age 55 (or later) but the amount
    of the pension would be the actuarial equivalent of that which he would have
    received had he waited until Normal Retirement Date to begin collecting his
    pension.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that Mr. Creber argues that art.
    2.1 (A.2) of the ESPA gives him the right to receive an unreduced pension at
    age 62.  He contends that the words
    “early retirement” in art. 2.1(A.2) can refer to s. 8.04 of the Plan.  Because s. 8.04 gives Mr. Creber the right to
    begin receiving his deferred pension earlier than age 65 (but not earlier than
    age 55), he says that s. 8.04 creates another early retirement date.  Thus, he says, art. 2.1(A.2) and s. 8.04 can
    be read together to give him the right to receive an unreduced pension
    beginning at age 62.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot read art. 2.1(A.2) in that fashion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intent of art. 2.1(A.2) of the ESPA is to give the
    Executive the right to receive his or her pension earlier than age 62, with a
    reduction of ¼ of 1% for each month by which the Executive’s early retirement
    date preceded age 62.  That is, it
    applies if the Executive took early retirement.  As we have seen, s. 5.02 of the Plan defines early retirement date as
    the 10-year period prior to “Normal Retirement Date” and “Normal Retirement
    Date” is defined as age 65 (s. 5.01).  Therefore, art. 2.1(A.2) applies if the Executive was between the ages
    of 55 and 65 when his or her employment with Revios ended.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This interpretation of art. 2.1(A.2) is harmonious with
    the Plan because the words “early retirement” are given the same meaning in
    both documents.  Furthermore, this
    interpretation is consistent with the intention of the ESPA, which was to
    provide benefits supplemental to, or in excess of, those given by the
    Plan.  Art. 2.1(A.2) provides a benefit
    that is in excess of that provided by the Plan because, as we have seen, s.
    6.02 of the Plan permits a member taking early retirement to begin to receive
    his or her pension earlier than age 62 with a reduction of &#8531; of 1% for
    each month by which the member’s early retirement date preceded age 62.  A reduction of &#8531; of 1% is greater than
    a reduction of ¼ of 1%, which is the reduction provided by art. 2.1(A.2).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because Mr. Creber’s employment with Revios ended when
    he was age 52, he does not qualify to receive early retirement benefits.  Although early retirement is not defined in
    the definition section of the Plan, it is defined in s. 5.02 and its meaning is
    clear and unambiguous – it occurs when a Plan member’s employment ends and the
    Plan member is between the ages of 55 and 65.  Section 8.04 of the Plan does not assist the appellant because it does
    not create an early retirement date.  Section
    8.04 gives the person entitled to a s. 8 deferred pension the right to begin
    receiving that pension before he or she reaches age 65 but after he or she
    attains the age of 55.  The fact that the
    member can choose to begin receiving his or her pension early is not the same
    thing as early retirement.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, to interpret the ESPA as the appellant
    contends would be to provide a new right for an executive who had not reached
    the age of 55 at the time his or her employment ended.  On the interpretation argued for by the
    appellant, the executive would receive a benefit that had been designated for
    those taking early retirement even though the executive did not qualify for
    early retirement under the Plan.  This is
    contrary to the principles governing the interpretation of contracts.  The ESPA is to be read in conjunction with
    the Plan, with the Plan in this case being the principal pension document.  The ESPA was not intended to create a
    substantive right that is at odds with the conditions for entitlement created
    by the Plan.  </p>
