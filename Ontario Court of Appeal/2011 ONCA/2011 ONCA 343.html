  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By pleading not guilty, an accused formally denies
    having committed the offence charged and requires the prosecutor to prove each
    essential element of the offence with which the accused is charged beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  To do so, the
    prosecutor introduces evidence that is relevant, material and admissible. The
    trier of <span class=GramE>fact,</span> whether judge or jury, assesses the
    evidence and decides whether the prosecutor’s proof meets or falls short of the
    standard required of it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>G. (D.M.) (the appellant) pleaded not guilty to a
    charge of sexual interference. He thought he would have a trial where he could
    tell his side of the story.  He had a
    lawyer to help him out.  But the
    appellant didn’t have a trial. He didn’t get to tell his side of the story. And
    he didn’t see or hear anyone else testify either.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As soon as the appellant’s lawyer pleaded not guilty on
    the appellant’s behalf, the prosecutor read out the allegations against him.
    The appellant’s lawyer said that he had no submissions. The prosecutor made no
    submissions either. The judge convicted the appellant and remanded him in
    custody for sentencing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks a new trial. He says that his
    conviction was a miscarriage of justice because his lawyer didn’t do his job
    properly. The respondent disputes the claim of ineffective assistance of
    counsel, but expresses some concern about the manner in which the proceedings
    played out on the trial date and their effect on the validity of the
    appellant’s conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that I will develop, I would allow the
    appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issues that we are required to decide have nothing to do with the substance of
    the allegations made against the appellant, whether truthful or spurious. It is
    enough to say that the appellant and complainant were related and living in the
    same home. The allegations involve several incidents of similar conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    procedural history of this case is of some importance to the issues raised. The
    sparse trial record has been supplemented, to our considerable advantage, by
    the materials required where ineffective assistance of trial counsel is raised
    as a ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The
    Charges</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    information laid against the appellant contained four counts. The counts, two
    of sexual assault and two of sexual interference, referred to the same dates
    and place and involve the same complainant.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    complainant provided a videotaped statement that the prosecutor proposed to
    introduce at trial under s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. Other witnesses also provided videotaped statements to investigators,
    but it is unclear whether those statements were ever transcribed for disclosure
    purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant was arrested with a warrant. After speaking with duty counsel, he was
    interviewed by the investigating officer. The interview was videotaped but not
    transcribed. During the interview, the appellant repeatedly denied the
    allegations. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Appellant Retains Trial Counsel</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant took the advice of a fellow inmate and retained a lawyer the inmate
    recommended to defend him on the charges. The retainer was completed about one
    month after the appellant’s arrest.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Judicial Interim Release Hearing</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant is over 60 years old with impaired hearing and several other health
    problems. As soon as the complainant reported her allegations, the appellant
    was evicted from the home where the offences were alleged to have occurred.  He moved to northern Ontario where he was
    arrested about five months after the complainant had reported her allegations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial
    counsel for the appellant concluded early on that the appellant had “no
    suitable release plan”. On the instructions of trial counsel, duty counsel waived
    the judicial interim release hearing to which the appellant was entitled. The
    appellant remained in custody.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Appearance of Trial Counsel </span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>About
    one month after the appellant’s arrest, trial counsel first appeared on his
    behalf before a justice of the peace. He consented to a detention order and
    made inquiries about available dates for a two-day trial.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Trial Dates are <span class=GramE>Fixed</span></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    December 3, 2007, trial counsel and the prosecutor appeared at a pre-trial
    before a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice. They were unable to agree on a
    suitable resolution of the charges.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    prosecutor elected to proceed by indictment and counsel elected trial by
    provincial court judge on the appellant’s behalf. The trial dates selected were
    February 21 and March 4, 2008. The prosecutor indicated that she would be
    calling four witnesses and relying on s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>to introduce the complainant’s videotaped interview.
    Videotaped interviews of prosecution witnesses other than the complainant had
    not yet been disclosed to trial counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial
    counsel for the appellant asked that a speaker system be provided for the
    appellant’s trial so that the appellant would be able to hear the proceedings.
    He also acknowledged that the appellant’s videotaped interview following his
    arrest was voluntary. The interview had not been transcribed nor had counsel
    viewed it. </span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Position of the Appellant</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his police interview and discussions with trial counsel, the appellant was
    adamant that he had not committed the offences alleged. If any touching had
    occurred, it was inadvertent as he attempted to prevent the complainant from
    jumping up and down on the bed in his room.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
    to trial counsel, the appellant also expressed some concern about requiring the
    young complainant to testify. That said<span class=GramE>,</span> the appellant
    never wavered from his denial of guilt and desire for a trial. Counsel did not
    explain to the appellant any of the procedural provisions available to assist
    the complainant in giving her evidence in trial proceedings.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Resolution Proposal</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    January 15, 2008, about five weeks before the first day scheduled for trial,
    the appellant’s trial counsel wrote to the prosecutor. Trial counsel proposed
    that the outstanding charges be resolved on the basis that the appellant would
    not contest the allegations of sexual interference in return for a sentence of
    imprisonment of six months, to be served in the community, followed by a
    probation order for 18 months.  Trial
    counsel also pointed out that the appellant did not wish to put the complainant
    through the stresses associated with a criminal trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>About
    one week later, the prosecutor responded to trial counsel’s proposal. The
    prosecutor agreed to resolve the outstanding charges on the basis of a plea of
    guilty to sexual interference, a sentence of imprisonment of 15 to 18 months, a
    period of probation for three years, and several ancillary orders. The
    prosecutor did not make her proposed resolution contingent on a joint
    submission, rather expressly left it open for trial counsel to advocate for a
    conditional sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>About
    one week before the first date set for trial, the prosecutor repeated her
    intention to introduce the interview of the complainant under s. 715.1 and
    advised trial counsel that she would also apply to have the complainant testify
    from behind a screen with a support person seated beside her.</span></p>

    counsel recalls that he spoke with the prosecutor prior to meeting with the
    appellant. The prosecutor agreed that she would not seek a sentence of more
    than 15 months imprisonment if the case were to be resolved. Counsel conveyed
    this information to the appellant who repeated his desire not to put the
    complainant through a trial. According to trial counsel, the appellant agreed
    to resolve the outstanding charges on this basis.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Your

    have to call witnesses to prove their case.  He is content that no witnesses be called in this matter, and he’s
    content that – that this court will find that, based on the allegations, that
    he is guilty of count 3, and that there will be later a conviction with respect
    to these offences, or that offence, in connection with the subject charge.  Mr. – I’ve spent a good deal of time with Mr.
    [G.]. So, he understands he’s giving up his right to a full trial in connection
    with this matter. My instructions re that he wishes to resolve the matter. And
    he is also aware of all the further – further positions of the Crown in
    connection with this matter with respect to the appropriate sentence, with
    respect to the fact that he’s going to be placed on a sexual registry in the future,

    result of trial counsel’s ineffective assistance, Mr. Rumble says, the

    proposed that the allegations be taken as a formal admission under s. 655 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Neither counsel made submissions.  The trial judge entered a conviction. Mr.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    general plea of not guilty is or represents an accused’s formal, in-court <i>denial</i> of having committed the offence
    to which the plea has been entered. A plea of not guilty provides notice to the
    prosecutor and to the trier of fact that the person charged requires the prosecutor
    to prove each essential element of the offence charged by evidence that is
    relevant, material and admissible at trial<a

    the other hand, a plea of guilty is a formal, in-court admission by an accused
    that she or he committed the offence to which the plea has been entered. An
    accused who pleads guilty consents to entry of a finding of guilt, or
    conviction without a trial and relieves the prosecutor of the burden of proving
    guilt, by relevant, material and admissible evidence, beyond a reasonable
    doubt. An accused who pleads guilty abandons his or her non-compellability as a
    witness, as well the right to remain silent, and surrenders his or her right to
    offer full answer and defence to the charge: <i>Adgey v. The Queen</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426, at p. 440, <i>per</i> Laskin J., in dissent on other

    nature and effect of a plea of guilty makes it essential that the plea be
    unequivocal, voluntary and informed. To ensure that pleas of guilty meet these
    requirements, s. 606(1.1) imposes an obligation on the presiding judge to
    satisfy him or herself of the voluntary and informed nature of the plea.  For the plea to be informed, the accused must
    understand that the plea is an admission of the essential elements of the
    offence and that the presiding judge is not bound by any agreement made by the
    accused and the prosecutor.  The accused
    must also understand the nature and consequences of a guilty plea. Under s.
    606(1.2) the failure of the trial judge to <i>fully</i> inquire about the voluntary and informed nature of the accused’s plea does not
    affect the validity of that plea.  But an
    inquiry is mandatory nonetheless.</span></p>

    conduct an inquiry to ensure that the plea is voluntary and informed. The plea itself

    understands that the plea is an admission of the essential elements of the
    offence and that the judge is not bound by any agreement that may have been
    made between the accused or counsel and the prosecutor. The judge must also be
    satisfied that the accused understands the nature and consequences of the plea,

    or right to testify in answer to the charge.</span></p>

    pleas of guilty have been entered, even where an accused is represented by
    counsel. Where what occurs is the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, an
    inquiry should be conducted to ensure that the accused understands the nature

    the appellant, Mr. Rumble says that the ineffective assistance provided by
    trial counsel caused a miscarriage of justice. In essence, trial counsel took
    advantage of a hearing-impaired client who had consistently denied the
    complainant’s allegations and wanted to trial at which he could testify and
    demonstrate his innocence. Instead, trial counsel countermanded the appellant’s
    instructions by entry of a plea of not guilty, followed by an uncontested
    recital of allegations with which he knew the appellant disagreed, in the
    knowledge that a conviction would inevitably follow.  </span></p>

    the complainant and her family. Trial counsel did not even find out the

    applicable standard of reasonable competence, because counsel failed to inform
    the appellant about the procedural mechanisms available for a youthful
    complainant to testify, thus assuaging the appellant’s expressed concern about
    requiring the complainant to testify. But more importantly, trial counsel never
    explained to the appellant that, despite his insistence on a trial, the
    procedure that was to be followed was not a trial, but rather would lead to the

    divergent. He submits that, in the end, the appellant’s account lacks
    credulity. His explanation of the origin and nature of the document he signed
    is beyond belief. His conduct during and after the proceedings of February 21,
    2008, including but not only his apology to the complainant’s mother and his
    original notice of appeal contesting only the fitness of his sentence,

lang=EN-US>Where a claim of ineffective

    to scrutinize the claim. The appellant must establish:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>i.          the
    facts that underpin the claims;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ii.         the
    incompetence of the representation provided by trial counsel (the performance
    component); and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iii.       <span
class=GramE>a</span> miscarriage of justice as a result of the incompetent
    representation (the prejudice component).</span></p>

    347, at p. 57.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The burden of establishing ineffective representation
    at trial that warrants appellate intervention rests upon the appellant who
    urges it.  The burden is not easily
    discharged.  Our approach to these claims
    requires caution: <i>B. (M.) </i>at para. 7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the facts that underpin the claim have been
    established, we begin with an examination of the prejudice component to
    determine whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  In the absence of prejudice, it is superfluous
    to consider the performance or competence component: <i>B. (M.) </i>at para. 7; <i>R. v. B.
    (G.D.)</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at paras. 29 and 34.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prejudice component acknowledges that, in the
    context of ineffective assistance of counsel, miscarriages of justice may take
    several forms.  Counsel’s inadequacies
    may cause procedural unfairness in the proceedings or compromise the
    reliability of the result reached at first instance: <i>B. (G.D.)</i> at para. 28. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In large measure, the nature of any demonstrated
    incompetence will dictate the kind of inquiry required to determine the effect
    of that incompetence on the fairness of the trial. Pervasive incompetence
    demands that the focus of the inquiry be on the effect of that incompetence on
    the fairness of the adjudicative process: <i>Joanisse</i> at pp. 62-63.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Claims of incompetence may fasten upon discrete
    decisions made or actions taken by trial counsel in the course of the defence.
    These claims reduce to an assertion that, because of trial counsel’s
    incompetence, the defence position was not properly advanced, or the
    prosecution’s case not properly challenged. We measure the effect of counsel’s
    incompetence on the fairness of the trial by reference to the impact of any
    error on the reliability of the result: <i>Joanisse</i> at p. 64.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some discrete decisions that have been advanced as
    demonstrative of trial counsel’s incompetence that have compromised the
    reliability of the result have included failure to prepare an accused for
    cross-examination, a failure to cross-examine a critical prosecution witness, a
    failure to obtain or review videotaped statements of witnesses, and a failure
    to have a transcript of prior inconsistent statements on which to cross-examine
    a witness: <i>Joanisse </i>at pp. 63-64; and <i>R. v. T. (P.) </i>(2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d)
    281 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 18 and 27-28.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The performance component has to do with incompetence
    on the part of trial counsel. We determine incompetence according to a standard
    of reasonableness that begins from a strong presumption that trial counsel’s
    conduct falls within the vast expanse of reasonable professional assistance. We
    place the onus on the appellant to establish the conduct of counsel, whether
    acts or <span class=GramE>omissions, that</span> are alleged not to have been
    the result of reasonable professional skill. We eschew the role of the Monday
    morning quarterback. The omniscience of hindsight occupies no place in our
    analysis: <i>B. (G.D.)</i> at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is critical to keep in mind that, during the course
    of criminal proceedings, defence <span class=GramE>counsel make</span> many
    decisions in good faith and in the best interests of his or her client. We
    ought <span class=GramE>not</span> look behind every decision counsel makes,
    except where it is essential to prevent a miscarriage of justice. Defence
    counsel need not always obtain approval for each and every decision they make
    in the conduct of an accused’s defence: <i>B.
    (G.D.) </i>at para. 34.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, some decisions, like whether to
    enter a plea of guilty or whether to testify, require instructions from the
    client. It is for the client, not for counsel to make these decisions. The
    failure to discuss these issues with the client and to obtain the necessary
    instructions may raise questions of procedural fairness and the reliability of
    the trial result and lead to a miscarriage of justice: <i>B. (G.D.)</i> at para. 34.</p>
  <h3>The
    Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has undertaken a painstaking analysis of
    almost every act or omission of trial counsel from initial retainer to final
    account.  I do not propose to do so.  At least as it seems to me, our focus ought
    to be on whether a miscarriage of justice occurred on February 21, 2008,
    because of the manner in which trial counsel conducted the case on the
    appellant’s behalf. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The failure of trial counsel to apply for judicial
    interim release and the reasonableness of his assessment of the viability of
    the appellant’s plan for release had no say in what occurred on February 21,
    2008.  The custodial status of the
    appellant, indeed whether a failure to seek the appellant’s judicial interim
    release reflected ineffective assistance, had disappeared into the background months
    before the trial date occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In one sense, as the respondent argues, the complaints
    about inadequate preparation for trial seem destined for the same refuse heap.
    After all, inadequate <i>trial </i>preparation
    is linked to counsel’s conduct at <i>trial</i>,
    an event that never occurred here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the first impression attraction of this
    argument, persuasively packaged by Mr. Hrybinsky, I am unable to say that the
    inadequacies of trial counsel’s preparation for trial were without influence on
    the proceedings that unfolded on February 21, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecutor and trial counsel were unable to resolve
    the case before trial. They estimated that trial proceedings would require two
    days of court time. The dates selected for trial were February 21 and March 4,
    2008.  The appellant denied the
    allegations.  When the parties arrived at
    the courthouse on February 21, 2008, the appellant was to enter a plea of not
    guilty. The prosecution’s case would follow and then an opportunity for the
    appellant to answer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 21, 2008, the first day of what was to be a
    two-day trial, trial counsel for the appellant had not reviewed or had
    transcribed the video statements of the complainant and other witnesses that
    were the core of the prosecution’s case against the appellant. Nor had he taken
    similar steps in connection with the appellant’s videotaped interview by the
    investigating officer that he had earlier acknowledged was voluntary, at least
    for the purposes of cross-examination of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel had not prepared the appellant to testify
    as a witness in his own defence despite the appellant’s repeated assertions
    that he wished to do so. Nor had counsel developed any meaningful strategy to
    defend the case or an outline of potential cross-examination of the prosecution
    witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, no trial took place. We have no trial
    transcript to review in order to assess whether trial counsel’s lack of
    preparation made the trial unfair or contributed to an unreliable verdict. On
    the other hand, only the stunningly naïve among us would not connect the dots
    between the lack of preparation and the fortuitous turn of events that
    terminated the trial proceedings by a <i>de
    facto</i> guilty plea, a procedure of which the appellant was not fully
    informed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A miscarriage of justice occurred in this case. The
    proceedings were encumbered by procedural unfairness. The practical effect of
    what occurred was that the appellant, who pleaded not guilty, essentially admitted
    the full sweep of the prosecutor’s allegations that he had consistently denied
    since arrest. Yet none of the safeguards that we associate with either formal
    admissions or pleas of guilty were evident in the rush to judgment that
    occurred here. A hasty, ill-informed <i>volte
    face</i> from an outright denial to a veiled acceptance of everything alleged
    in the blink of an eye as trial proceedings were about to begin.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What occurred here also raises questions about the
    reliability of the conclusion of guilt that rests upon allegations untested in
    the crucible of cross-examination because of inadequate trial preparation by
    the appellant’s former counsel.</p>
