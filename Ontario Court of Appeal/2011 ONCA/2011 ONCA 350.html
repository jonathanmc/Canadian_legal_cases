    Justice in Brampton convicted the appellant, Andrew Plummer, of possession of a
    prohibited firearm, possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle, possession of a
    firearm in contravention of a prohibition order, and related offences. The
    trial judge sentenced the appellant to 16 months in custody in addition to 16
    months of credit for pre-trial custody. The appellant appeals his convictions.</p>

    the afternoon of September 12, 2006, the appellant met his girlfriend, Shevon
    Bennett, who had parked her car in the fire lane beside the appellant’s
    apartment residence at 85 Orenda Court in Brampton. He brought with him Ms.
    Bennett’s overnight bag, which she had left at his home the night before. The
    appellant wore a bulletproof vest and carried a handgun in his waistband. The
    appellant sat in the passenger seat of Ms. Bennett’s car which was registered
    to her mother.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Constables
    Michael Ratych and John Hunt were in a patrol car in the area. They saw the
    Bennett car parked facing the wrong way in a clearly marked no-parking zone.
    They knew that the door at 85 Orenda Court closest to the Bennett car was used
    for drug buys.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    they passed by the Bennett car, the police officers saw an expression of
    surprise or shock on the appellant’s face and they saw him make some movement
    downward in his seat. After they had passed the car, the officers saw the
    appellant bend forward and slouch down. Constable Hunt thought that the
    appellant’s movements were  consistent
    with concealing drugs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    officers made a u-turn and came back to investigate the Bennett car and its
    occupants. They exited the van, approached the Bennett car, and asked the
    occupants for their names. When the appellant provided his name to Constable
    Ratych, the officer went to speak to his partner out of earshot of the
    appellant because he immediately associated the name with an officer safety
    alert that had circulated a week before. The alert described the appellant as
    possibly armed with a handgun and in possession of a bulletproof vest.</span></p>

    Ratych returned to the passenger side of the car and asked the appellant to
    exit. He believed that he had grounds to search the appellant on the basis of
    the alert, the appellant’s reaction to seeing the police, and his apparent
    attempt to hide something.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once
    the appellant got out of the car, Constable Ratych conducted a pat-down search
    and felt the bulletproof vest. He informed Constable Hunt about what he had
    found and proceeded to the car with a view to searching it. The focus of his
    interest was determining if there was a gun and, if so, seizing it. The
    appellant remained standing outside the car near the officers.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Contrary
    to Constable Ratych’s testimony that he saw the gun in plain view at the top of
    the open bag on the floor in front of the passenger seat, the trial judge
    described the search for, and seizure of, the gun in this fashion: “I find the
    officer probably first checked under the passenger’s seat, and that the gun was
    likely under items in the bag.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    Constable Ratych searched the bag in the car, the appellant fled from the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant made an application to exclude the evidence of the gun on the basis
    that his rights under section 8 (unreasonable search and seizure) and section 9
    (arbitrary detention) of the <i>Charter</i> had been violated.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge ruled that the detention of the appellant by the police was lawful.
    He referred to the alert relating to the appellant, the appellant’s reaction to
    seeing the police, and his suspicious conduct in the car as if he were
    concealing something and concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>With
    that constellation of factors, the officers were entitled to embark on an
    investigative detention. The detention was lawful having regard to the nature
    of the situation, the seriousness of gun crimes, the information known to the
    police about the applicant, and the detention was reasonably responsive to and
    tailored to the circumstances as he was asked to step out of the car. Balancing
    the seriousness of the risk to the public with the liberty interests of the
    applicant, the detention was no more intrusive of liberty interests than was
    necessary to address the risk. [Citation omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge held that the pat-down search of the appellant was lawful. He
    reasoned:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I accept Ratych’s evidence that he was honestly
    concerned for the safety of the people in the vicinity, as well as his and
    Hunt’s. Objectively, that was a reasonable conclusion. The applicant was seated
    in a parked car close to a door used by drug purchasers. He was surprised to
    see police, and acted suspiciously as if he was concealing something when the
    officers passed. The officers had some information, of unknown reliability,
    that the applicant was possibly armed and dangerous. Those factors made
    Ratych’s decision to conduct a “pat-down” search reasonable and lawful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that once Constable Ratych found
    the bulletproof vest, he reasonably decided that it gave credence to the alert,
    raising the level of suspicion so as to entitle him to go into the car and
    search the very area where the police had seen the appellant acting
    suspiciously as if he was concealing something. The trial judge noted that
    trial counsel “conceded that if the officers saw the suspicious movements and
    knew of the alert, they could search the bag and car, at least in the area
    where Mr. Plummer was seated.” The trial judge summarized his conclusion
    regarding the vehicle search as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]here the police see conduct consistent with
    concealing something in the area of the front passenger seat, have information
    the person may be carrying a gun and wearing a bullet proof vest, and confirm
    he is wearing a bullet proof vest, to find that the police had to stop their
    search once they found he was not carrying a gun on him, flies in the face of
    concerns for officer safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge recorded that if he were wrong
    in his conclusion that there was no violation of ss. 8 and 9, he would
    nonetheless have admitted the evidence of the gun. In reaching the conclusion
    that he would not exclude this evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>, the trial judge applied
    (because he made his ruling in 2007) the criteria in <i>R. v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265 (“<i>Collins</i>”) and <i>R. v. Stillman</i>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607 (“<i>Stillman</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions. He contends that
    the trial judge erred in his analysis and conclusions relating to all three of
    the <i>Charter</i> issues described above.
    His submission is that the detention was unlawful, the search of the bag inside
    the car was unreasonable, and the evidence of the gun should have been excluded
    from the trial.</p>

    appellant contends that the trial judge erred by finding that Constable Ratych
    possessed the requisite reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative
    detention. There are two components to the appellant’s submission on this
    issue. First, the appellant submits that the trial judge’s reliance on the
    appellant’s “suspicious” conduct in the car did not provide the requisite
    suspicion for an investigative detention pursuant to <i>R. v. Mann</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59 (“<i>Mann</i>”). Second, the appellant argues that the trial judge relied
    improperly on an officer alert that had uncorroborated and vague information.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    do not accept these submissions. I begin with two preliminary observations.
    First, the threshold of reasonable grounds for an investigative detention must
    be determined through an examination of the totality of the circumstances: see <i>Mann</i> at para. 34 and <i>R. v. Clayton</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 725, at
    para. 30 (“<i>Clayton</i>”). Second, the
    trial judge’s assessment of the evidence and findings of fact must be accorded
    substantial deference by a reviewing court: see <i>R. v. Cornell</i>, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 142, at paras. 22-25. More
    specifically, the ultimate findings by the trial judge that there were
    reasonable grounds to detain are also owed some measure of deference because of
    the significant factual element involved in this determination.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning
    to the appellant’s first submission on this issue, I do not think it was
    improper for the trial judge to consider both the appellant’s reaction to
    seeing the police and his movements consistent with attempting to conceal
    something as factors amongst the totality of the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
    is abundant authority for observations of reactions by suspects to police
    presence permissibly forming part of the constellation of factors that may
    determine the legality of an investigative detention. The value of such
    evidence, if any, will inevitably be determined by its intersection with the
    myriad of other circumstances in play: see, for example, <i>Clayton</i> at paras. 9-10 and 44-46; <i>R. v. Nesbeth</i> (2008), 238 C.C.C. (3d) 567 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 5
    and 17-18 (“<i>Nesbeth</i>”); and <i>R. v. Dene</i>, 2010 ONCA 796, at para. 4.
    The trial judge’s analysis in this case of the police officers’ perceptions of
    the appellant’s body language and movements is entirely consistent with these
    authorities.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to the appellant’s second submission on this issue, I see nothing wrong
    with the trial judge’s treatment of the Officer Safety Alert. Although the
    information in the alert was stated to have come from a confidential informant
    (I regard this as a neutral, not a negative, factor), the trial judge properly
    focused on several features of the alert to find it deserving of weight in the
    reasonable suspicion calculus:  the alert
    provided recent information, it provided considerable detail about the suspect,
    and it provided information of motive. His analysis in this respect was
    consistent with the framework enunciated by this court in <i>R. v. Simpson</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 at 503-04 and <i>R. v. Lewis</i> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 481

    70 (Ont. C.A.) (“<i>B.(L.)</i>”), two police
    officers on patrol decided to speak to two young men engaged in suspicious
    activity. When first noticed by the police, one of the young men, L.B., was
    holding a black bag in his hand. By the time the officers joined the two young
    men, one of the officers noted that L.B. was no longer carrying the black bag.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>At
    the top of the stairs, Officer Purches quickly located the black bag. He found
    it “on the grass with some litter”. As he did so, he called down to L.B. and F,
    who were “at the bottom with Detective Constable Reimer”, and asked “whose bag
    is this”. F did not respond; L.B. replied “I don’t know”. In view of L.B.’s
    response and the fact that he had distanced himself physically from the bag,
    Officer Purches treated the bag as abandoned property and he opened it. Inside,
    he located school work with L.B.’s name on it; he also discovered a loaded .22 calibre
    handgun. At that point he shouted “gun, gun, gun” and he and his partner

    the appellant did in this case amounts to a form of double abandonment. First,
    he removed the gun from his person and hid it in his girlfriend’s bag. Second,
    he then ran away from the scene. Taken together, the appellant first distanced
    himself from the gun, by placing it in the bag, and then distanced himself from

    speaking, it is not necessary to address this issue in light of the resolution
    of the privacy issue above. However, since this issue was fully argued in the

    observations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the appellant concedes that if there were grounds for an investigative
    detention, the pat-down search of his person following his detention was a
    lawful search. This is an appropriate concession. <i>Mann </i>stands for the proposition that where a police officer has
    reasonable grounds to believe that his or her safety or the safety of others is
    at risk, the officer may engage in a protective pat-down search of the detained
    individual.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    trial counsel conceded that once the bulletproof vest was found during the
    pat-down search, the officers were then entitled to search the bag and car, at
    least in the area where the appellant was seated. Appellate counsel resiled
    from this concession and sought to argue the opposite. Crown counsel did not
    object. In my view, this was a fair response from the Crown, especially in
    light of the dearth of jurisprudence on the point.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning
    to the merits, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law by
    creating a power to search a vehicle incident to an investigative detention.
    Constable Ratych did not arrest the appellant upon feeling what he thought was
    a bulletproof vest; had he done so on adequate grounds, the police arguably
    would have been entitled to search the vehicle as a search incident to the
    arrest. However, since no arrest was made, the only basis on which Constable
    Ratych could have legally entered the vehicle to search the bag was if there
    was a common law power to search a vehicle and its contents incidental to an
    investigative detention of a person. The appellant submits that there is no
    such recognized common law power and the trial judge erred by creating the
    power in the factual circumstances of this case.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    support of this position, the appellant makes three submissions. First, <i>Mann</i>, the case that created the power to
    search incidental to an investigative detention, supports his position. Second,
    a ‘bright line’ interpretation limiting <i>Mann</i> to a search of the detained person is the preferred interpretation. Third, on
    the facts of this case, there was no immediate safety risk justifying a search
    beyond the pat-down search of the appellant permitted by <i>Mann</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to the appellant’s first submission, he is correct to focus on <i>Mann</i>. In <i>Mann</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that there is a limited common
    law power of protective search incidental to an investigative detention. Such a
    search will only be justified if it is reasonably necessary, reasonably
    executed, and based on a reasonable belief by the police that officer safety or
    the safety of others is at risk in the totality of the circumstances.</span></p>

    defining the search power in <i>Mann</i>,
    Iacobucci J. relied on the decades of American jurisprudence emanating from the
    decision of the United States Supreme Court in <i>Terry v. Ohio</i>, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), which held at p. 27:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]here
    must be a narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons

    has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Mann</i>, Iacobucci J. described the
    power to search incidental to an investigative detention in similar fashion at
    para. 45:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>To
    summarize, as discussed above, police officers may detain an individual for
    investigative purposes if there are reasonable grounds to suspect in all the
    circumstances that the individual is connected to a particular crime and that
    such a detention is necessary.  In
    addition, where a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that his or
    her safety or that of others is at risk, the officer may engage in a protective
    pat-down search of the detained individual.  Both the detention and the pat-down search must be conducted in a reasonable
    manner.  In this connection, I note that
    the investigative detention should be brief in duration and does not impose an
    obligation on the detained individual to answer questions posed by the police.  The investigative detention and protective search
    power are to be distinguished from an arrest and the incidental power to search
    on arrest, which do not arise in this case.</span></p>

    Indeed, in <i>Mann</i>, the court actually
    considered both a pat-down search of the person detained, which it upheld, and
    a search inside the detainee’s pockets, which it found to be unreasonable.
    Accordingly, I agree with this court’s interpretation of <i>Mann</i> in <i>R. v. Batzer</i> (2005), 200 C.C.C. (3d) 330 at para. 16: “the [Supreme Court of Canada] leaves
    the clear inference that on the right facts, a search incidental to a lawful

    40:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    Appellant submits that in the absence of legislation from Parliament, the Court
    should refrain from creating yet another expanded police search power. Rather,

    the right to be free from unreasonable searches and legitimate safety concerns
    is at the core of <i>Mann</i>. The

    example, discovery of a bulletproof vest) continues to present a reasonable
    safety concern? In my view,  <i>Mann</i> answers this question at the level
    of principle. <i>Mann</i> circumscribes

    similar logic and similar answer govern the United States jurisprudence on this
    issue. In <i>Terry v. Ohio</i>, the United
    States Supreme Court enunciated the power to search the person incidental to an
    investigative detention. Fifteen years later, in <i>Michigan v. Long</i>, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), the court expanded the
    power, still anchored in safety concerns, to a search of the interior of a
    vehicle driven by the person detained. Justice O’Connor explained the logic of
    the extension at p. 1050:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Our
    past cases indicate then that protection of police and others can justify
    protective searches when police have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses
    a danger, that roadside encounters between police and suspects are especially
    hazardous, and that danger may arise from the possible presence of weapons in
    the area surrounding a suspect. These principles compel our conclusion that the
    search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in
    which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer
    possesses a reasonable belief based on “specific and articulable facts which,
    taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably
    warrant” the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect
    may gain immediate control of weapons. See <i>Terry</i>,

    was wearing a bulletproof vest, they had an honest concern that the appellant
    had immediate access to a weapon that was a threat to their safety and the
    safety of people in the vicinity.</span></p>

    this backdrop, I do not see why, once Constable Ratych discovered the
    bulletproof vest, he should be required to reject a further search for the gun
    in the immediate vicinity, including the passenger side area of the car in
    which the appellant had been seated moments before. To expect the police
    officer to abandon his search, release the appellant and, in effect, turn his
    back on the appellant as he walks back to the police cruiser is, in my view,
    both unrealistic and unreasonable: see <i>Clayton</i> at paras. 43-44 and <i>Michigan v. Long</i>,

  <p class=ParaNo0><b>Sharpe J.A.  (Concurring):</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with MacPherson J.A. that the police had
    reasonable grounds to conduct an investigative detention of the appellant.  It is conceded that if such grounds existed,
    the police could conduct a protective pat-down search of the appellant to
    ensure officer safety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with MacPherson J.A. that the appellant
    lacked standing to allege that the search of his girlfriend’s bag violated his
    s. 8 <i>Charter</i> right, as the appellant
    had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag in the circumstances of
    this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal on the standing point.  In my respectful view, as the appeal can
    readily be decided on this ground, we should not deal with the difficult and
    contentious issue of whether the limited power to conduct a pat-down search to
    ensure officer safety should be extended to permit the search of bags and
    vehicles.  However, my colleague has
    dealt with that issue, and as I take a somewhat different approach, I will
    explain why I would find that, on the particular facts of this case, the search
    did not violate the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R. v. Mann</i>,
    [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59 establishes “a limited power of protective search”, defined,
    at para. 45, to be “a protective pat-down search of the detained
    individual.”  <i>Mann</i> represented a modest but significant expansion of police
    powers.  No Canadian case extends that
    power to cover additional searches of vehicles or items in vehicles.  <i>Mann</i> states, at para. 17, that the courts “must tread softly” when asked to expand
    police powers, and that the creation of new police powers is “better
    accomplished through legislative deliberation than by judicial decree”.  It was “for that very reason” that the Court
    refused “to recognize a general power of detention for investigative purposes”
    referring, at para. 18, to the need for the court to exercise “its custodial
    role” to control and constrain “the unregulated use of investigative detentions
    in policing…and the potential for abuse inherent in such low-visibility
    exercises of discretionary power.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cautionary note sounded in <i>Mann </i>is rooted in the historic role of the courts, standing between
    the individual and the state, and reluctant to grant or recognize new police
    powers that encroach on individual liberty: see James Stribopolous, “The Limits
    of Judicially Created Police Powers: Investigative Detention After <i>Mann</i>” (2007) 52 Crim. L.Q. 299.  In my view, we should follow <i>Mann</i>’s caution in a case like the
    present, when we are asked to expand the scope of a search incidental to an
    investigative detention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <span lang=EN-US>search
    incidental to an investigative detention is defined and limited by the
    immediate concerns of officer safety.  </span>This
    reflects an important difference between the narrowly focussed and strictly
    limited protective search that may accompany an investigative detention, and
    the broader power to search consequent to a lawful arrest.  It is necessary to maintain that distinction
    and to confine the scope of a search incidental to an investigative detention
    within strict limits.  Here, the police
    did not arrest the appellant, presumably because they did not think they had
    grounds for an arrest.  As the appellant
    points out, there is an understandable tendency to expand a narrow rule to
    endorse the police conduct being challenged, since the case before the court will
    always be one where the search actually yielded a weapon or some other valuable
    evidence.  This is a tendency that the
    courts should resist.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    on the facts as found by the trial judge, I agree that a modest extension of
    the <i>Mann</i> pat-down search was
    justified in this case.  Although the
    officers had the appellant under their temporary control, the situation was
    fluid.  The appellant’s earlier actions,
    when he appeared to conceal something in the vehicle, combined with the Officer
    Safety Alert indicating that he might be carrying a gun, gave rise to a
    legitimate serious concern that he had immediate access to a weapon that he
    could use if the officers were to simply release him and return to their own
    vehicle. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On those specific facts, I agree that the officers were
    entitled to search the bag in the car as an incident of the investigative
    detention to ensure their own immediate safety.  While this does represent a modest extension of the protective pat-down
    search in <i>R. v. Mann</i>, it is limited
    by the concern for immediate officer safety that underpins <i>Mann</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I would emphasize that this should not be read
    as giving the police <i>carte blanche</i> power to permit searches of bags or vehicles incident to investigative
    detention.  Such a search demands satisfactory
    proof of a serious concern for officer safety that requires something more than
    the initial pat-down.</p>
