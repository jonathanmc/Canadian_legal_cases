  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Toth Equity Limited (Toth) owns the Towngate Shopping Centre, a property
    located at 2446-2470 Bank Street, Ottawa.  It claims that the City of Ottawa
    (the City) overcharged it for property taxes on the property in the 2003, 2004
    and 2005 tax years (the Claim).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated June 30, 2010 (the Order), the Divisional Court issued an
    order in  the nature of <i>mandamus</i>, requiring the Ottawa City Council
    (City Council) to hold a meeting pursuant to s. 357(5) of the <i>Municipal Act,
    2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c. 25, at which Toth is to be permitted to make
    representations with respect to the Claim.  In addition, it ordered City Council
    to make a decision with respect to the issues that Toth raises at the meeting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal.  As I explain below, in my view, the Order
    cannot stand because it (1) conflicts with the legislative scheme established
    by s. 357 of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>; and (2) runs contrary to
    established jurisprudence, which requires Toth to exhaust its appeal rights in
    the administrative process before pursuing an application for judicial review.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND IN BRIEF</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Towngate Shopping Centre is a 100,516 square
    foot shopping centre in Ottawa.  In 2005, Toth complained to the Assessment
    Review Board (the ARB), under s. 40 of the <i>Assessment Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, A.
    31, that the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) assessments for
    the property were too high.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The s. 40 complaints were disposed of by way of
    a settlement between Toth and MPAC.  As a result of the settlement, the ARB released
    three consent decisions in May of 2005, one for each of the tax years 2003,
    2004 and 2005 (the ARB consent decisions).  The City was not a party to the s. 40
    proceedings, settlement or ARB consent decisions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The ARB consent decisions resulted in a
    reduction of the total assessed value of the property.  However, they also led
    to a change in the apportionment of value for the property, with more value being
    placed on the “commercial property” class and less on the “shopping centre” class. 
    The commercial property class carries a higher tax rate in Ottawa. 
    Consequently, there was an increase in the property taxes.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The ARB consent decisions were sent to the City
    so that it could make the necessary tax adjustments.  By letter dated August
    24, 2005, the City advised Toth of the tax increases for the property for 2003,
    2004 and 2005, resulting from the ARB consent decisions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to Toth, the City made an error in
    2001 in calculating the property taxes for the shopping centre and that error
    has had an impact on the calculation of taxes in the years that followed.  It
    says that in calculating the 2001 taxes, the City was required to calculate the
    notional taxes for 2000, the base year.  In calculating the 2000 notional
    taxes, the City had to take into account the changes in apportionment.  Toth
    says the City failed to recalculate the 2000 notional taxes based on those
    changes.  This error allegedly led to errors in the property taxes charged for
    2003, 2004 and 2005.  Toth says that it was overcharged by an amount in excess
    of $400,000 for those years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Toth says that it discovered the alleged errors
    in 2005.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The City contends that the alleged errors are
    the unintended ramifications flowing from the settlement and the ARB consent
    decisions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While there was much correspondence between Toth
    and the City, the two key documents are a letter dated September 26, 2005, from
    Toth to the City, and the City’s response to Toth in a letter dated October 18,
    2005.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the September 26, 2005 letter, Toth<a

    the cancellation, reduction or refund in taxes resulting from the ARB consent
    decisions in the 2003, 2004 and 2005 taxation years.  It claimed that it had
    been overcharged by reason of a “gross or manifest error” in the preparation of
    the assessment role.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 357(f) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>,
    gives a municipality the power to reduce or refund taxes if a person was
    “overcharged due to a gross or manifest error that is clerical or factual in
    nature”.  Pursuant to s. 357(3), an application must be brought before February
    28 of the year following the year in respect of which the application is made.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The City responded in a letter dated October 18,
    2005.  It advised Toth that the shift in the apportionment from shopping class
    to commercial class tax flowing from the ARB consent decisions led to the
    increase in taxes.  It said that the adjustments that were made followed the
    procedures outlined in the relevant legislation.  As there had been no error in
    calculations, no adjustments could be made as a result of Toth’s application.   </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>City Council did not hold a meeting to consider

    respect of the tax matters relating to the 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years with the
    ARB, on the basis that City Council did not make a decision (the
    “non-decision”) by September 30, 2006.  What has transpired in relation to
    these appeals is discussed below in the section entitled “The requirement to
    exhaust adequate alternative remedies”.  </span></p>

    in the Divisional Court.  Its basic position was that in failing to hold a
    meeting to consider its application, the City was in breach of its obligation
    under s. 357(5) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, <i>2001</i>, because the application
    had been brought within the statutory timelines.</span></p>

    Court stated that the City erred in law by refusing to provide Toth with a
    hearing before City Council and the opportunity to make representations at that
    hearing in respect of its Claim.  It further stated that Toth was not required
    to exhaust other means of obtaining relief before following the procedure that
    it had chosen (i.e. the application for judicial review).   </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the Divisional Court erred in law in two

    established by s. 357 of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>.  Second, the Order runs
    contrary to established jurisprudence which requires a person, absent
    exceptional circumstances, to exhaust his or her appeal rights in the

    that the application did not meet the requirement of a gross or manifest error

    with the municipal council because the ARB “may make any decision that council
    could have made” (s. 357(10)).  In so doing, the legislature created a statutory
    scheme specifically designed to provide an adequate remedy when a council

    the right to appeal City Council’s “non-decision” to the ARB, Toth was not
    required to exhaust that right before pursuing its application for judicial
    review.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, the Divisional Court erred in principle
    in so concluding.  It is an important principle of administrative law that,
    absent exceptional circumstances, a party must exhaust any available adequate
    alternative remedy within the administrative process before pursuing an
    application for judicial review: see <i>Harelkin v. University of Regina</i>,
    [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Canadian courts have enforced this general
    principle vigorously.  In the recent decision of <i>C. B. Powell Ltd. v. Canada
    (Border Services Agency)</i>, 2010 FCA 61, at paras. 31-32, Stratas J.A. of the
    Federal Court of Appeal, usefully describes the principle and its rationale.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[31]     Administrative law
    judgments and textbooks describe this rule in many ways: the doctrine of
    exhaustion, the doctrine of adequate alternative remedies, the doctrine against
    fragmentation or bifurcation of administrative proceedings, the rule against
    interlocutory judicial reviews and the objection against premature judicial reviews. 
    All of these express the same concept: absent exceptional circumstances,
    parties cannot proceed to the court system until the administrative process has
    run its course.  This means that, absent exceptional circumstances, those who
    are dissatisfied with some matter arising in the ongoing administrative process
    must pursue all effective remedies that are available within that process; only
    when the administrative process has finished or when the administrative process
    affords no effective remedy can they proceed to court.  Put another way, absent
    exceptional circumstances, courts should not interfere with ongoing
    administrative processes until after they are completed, or until the available,
    effective remedies are exhausted.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[32]     This prevents fragmentation
    of the administrative process and piecemeal court proceedings, eliminates the
    large costs and delays associated with premature forays to court and avoids the
    waste associated with hearing an interlocutory judicial review when the
    applicant for judicial review may succeed at the end of the administrative
    process anyway… Further, only at the end of the administrative process will a
    reviewing court have all of the administrative decision-maker’s findings; these
    findings may be suffused with expertise, legitimate policy judgments and
    valuable regulatory experience. ..  Finally, this approach is consistent with
    and supports the concept of judicial respect for administrative decision-makers
    who, like judges, have decision-making responsibilities to discharge.  [citations

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>(8)</b>  If council fails to make its decision

    remedy?  In <i>Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band</i>, [1995] 1
    S.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court set out a number of factors that should be
    considered when determining whether a statutory appeal procedure is an adequate
    alternative remedy.  At para. 37, Lamer C.J., writing for a majority of the
    court, states:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[I] conclude that a variety of
    factors should be considered by courts in determining whether they should enter
    into judicial review, or alternatively should require an applicant to proceed
    through a statutory appeal procedure. These factors include: the convenience of
    the alternative remedy, the nature of the error, and the nature of the
    appellate body (i.e., its investigatory, decision-making and remedial
    capacities). I do not believe that the category of factors should be closed, as
    it is for courts in particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors
    which are relevant.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based on a consideration of these factors, in my
    view, there can be no doubt but that an appeal to the ARB is an adequate
    alternative to judicial review.  The ARB is a specialized tribunal with
    expertise and experience in dealing with property tax and assessment matters. 
    As the Divisional Court held in <i>Municipal Property Assessment Corp. v. Minto
    Developments Inc. </i>(2003), 2 M.P.L.R. (4th) 89, at paras. 31-34, decisions
    of the ARB are to be afforded deference because of the powers and functions
    vested in it and the high degree of expertise needed to decide the complex
    disputes over property classification that it is called on to adjudicate.  In
    the present case, the alleged errors relate to the assessed value of property
    and the calculation of property taxes, matters squarely within the
    jurisdiction, and specialized expertise of, the ARB.  Moreover, the ARB has
    full remedial powers, as it can make any order that the City Council could have
    made (s. 357(10)).  </span></p>

    appeal right to the ARB?  Toth says that it did.  In its factum, Toth states that
    it attempted to appeal to the ARB but “was informed that the ARB lacked jurisdiction
    to hear the appeal”.  In making this submission, Toth relies on para. 16 of the
    reply affidavit evidence of Gordon Jones, a Senior Manager in Property Tax Services
    for Deloitte &amp; Touche, in which Mr. Jones says “my interpretation of the
    guidance we have received from the ARB is that they will not hear appeals on
    the matter until Council has issued a decision on the application”.  There is
    no correspondence (or anything else) from the ARB provided as support for this
    statement.  </span></p>

    its appeal with the ARB.  It acknowledges that Toth commenced appeals in
    respect of the alleged errors.  However, the City says that despite requests to
    Toth for clarification, it has never been given any evidence that Toth attempted
    to pursue the appeals or otherwise revive them.  The City checked the e-status
    of the ARB’s appeal files, which indicate that the files have been “closed”. 
    The record does not contain any explanation for why the files have been
    closed.  Counsel for the City stated that based on Toth’s submissions at the
    Divisional Court, the files were closed for “administrative reasons”, which
    suggests that Toth did not prosecute its appeals.  He also noted that while
    there is a statement in Mr. Jones’ affidavit to the effect that he understood
    that the ARB would not hear the appeals, there is nothing in the record from
    the ARB to this effect and it runs contrary to the ARB’s established
    jurisprudence.         </span></p>

    exhausted its appeal right prior to bringing an application for judicial review. 
    Section 357(10) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, makes it mandatory that the
    ARB hear appeals brought pursuant to s. 357(8).  Various decisions rendered by
    the ARB make it clear that it hears cases in which a municipal council did not
    hold a meeting or make a decision:  see, for example, <i>Mattamy (Castlemore)
    Ltd. v. Brampton (City)</i>, [2010] O.A.R.B.D. No. 602.  And, s. 357(18)
    requires the ARB to forward a copy of the decisions they make under s. 357 to
    the assessment corporation.  Accordingly, one would have thought that it would
    have been a simple matter for Toth to have filed the ARB’s decisions in respect
    of its appeals, had such decisions been made.  The record contains no such decisions. 
    Instead, the evidence is that the ARB has “closed” its files on these appeals. 
    The fact that a file has been closed does not mean that a decision was
    rendered.  </span></p>

    approximately 30 months.  The City submits that the Divisional Court further
    erred by failing to address the issue of Toth’s delay in pursuing its
