  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in comprehensive, thoughtful,
    responsive reasons found the appellant guilty of aggravated sexual assault
    while acquitting him of the charge of attempt murder.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the verdict was unreasonable
    and that the trial judge erred in dismissing the defence position that there
    was an alternate suspect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issue at trial was identity.  The trial judge’s credibility finding in
    favour of the complainant, C.B., as well as the timing of the assault is
    entitled to deference.  The Crown’s
    theory was that C.B. was hit on the head and knocked unconscious before being sexually
    assaulted, while the defence suggested that she may have blacked out due to
    intoxication and been sexually assaulted by a third person at a later point in
    time.  The trial judge gave careful
    consideration to this issue, including finding that C.B.’s observations in the
    period immediately prior were “the product of a conscious working and aware
    mind” before concluding that C.B. was knocked unconscious.  After C.B. refused consensual sex with the
    appellant a second time, C.B.’s last memory was of seeing the appellant
    following her and then being on her back screaming, “You’re going to kill
    me.”  Her account of the surroundings she
    saw while on her back was confirmed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was also entitled to rely on the circumstantial
    evidence to confirm C.B.’s account.  That
    evidence consisted of the appellant’s DNA on the rock covered in her blood as
    well as convincing eye witness testimony that the appellant had worn a shirt
    that night and returned shirtless.  A
    discarded shirt that bore the complainant’s blood and the appellant’s DNA was
    found near the crime scene.  It was the
    trial judge’s role to resolve inconsistencies in the evidence respecting the
    colour of the shirt and he made no error in doing so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the appellant’s statement to the police, the
    trial judge did not, as the appellant contends, make an inference of guilt from
    the statement.  The conclusions he drew
    from the statement were available to him on the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s submissions and his specific complaints
    about the trial judge’s conclusions on isolated pieces of evidence are, in
    essence, an attempt to reargue the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The totality of the evidence amply supported the
    conviction.  The appellant’s guilt was
    the only rational inference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In coming to this conclusion, we do not ignore the
    appellant’s second argument, namely, that <span lang=EN-GB>the trial judge failed to give proper consideration to the evidence of
    an alternate suspect.  In our opinion,
    having regard to the evidence as to the timing of the assault, which he
    accepted, he was entitled to conclude that defence counsel was asking him to
    speculate that there was an alternative suspect.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed. </span></p>
