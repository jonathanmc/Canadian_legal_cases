  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late 2008, Pal Vasarhelyi (the appellant) laid <span
class=GramE>an information</span> under oath before a justice of the peace. The
    appellant alleged that, decades earlier, Ilona Vasarhelyi had committed
    perjury, arson and fraud.  The justice of
    the peace received the information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About a month after he laid the information, the
    appellant testified as the only witness on the pre-enquete held to determine
    whether process should issue to compel Ilona Vasarhelyi to answer to the
    charge. The justice of the peace refused to issue process.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Some
    procedural history and a brief recital of the essential features of the
    appellant’s evidence are critical to the analysis that follows.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The
    Information</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant appeared before a justice of the peace on December 4, 2008, and laid
    an information containing allegations of arson, perjury and fraud against his
    former wife.  According to the appellant,
    his ex-wife was criminally responsible for <span class=GramE>an arson</span> at
    his business premises in 1985 and committed perjury on several different
    occasions between 1990 and 1998. The appellant claimed that his ex-wife also
    stole his OHIP card in 1984 and provided it to others who fraudulently obtained
    prescription drugs or health related services.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    justice of the peace, apparently satisfied that the allegations met the requirements
    of s. 504(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    received the information.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Pre-enquete</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    January 12, 2009, a justice of the peace undertook a pre-enquete to determine whether
    process should issue to compel Ilona </span>Vasarhelyi to answer to the charges
    contained in the appellant’s information. The appellant was there with counsel.
    A student-at-law appeared for the Attorney General. The appellant was the only
    witness who gave evidence at the hearing.  </p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Evidence at the Pre-enquete</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    allegations of perjury include several discrete incidents over many years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant claimed that, as a result of his ex-wife’s “perjury”, he was detained
    at the airport for two or three hours in March, 1990, when he was taking their
    child to his place in Florida for March break.  He says that his ex-wife told the F.B.I. that he was a “spy and an
    international criminal”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant gave two other examples of his ex-wife’s perjury.  One occurred in a family court proceeding on
    June 8, 1998, when she falsely claimed that he had harassed her physically and
    emotionally during the hearing: “officials took a restraining order against me
    without my knowledge”. On February 10, 1999, during the appellant’s trial on a
    charge of uttering death threats, his ex-wife claimed that he had hired a hit man
    to kill her. The appellant was in custody during the investigation and
    convicted of the offence charged.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant did not produce any transcripts of the allegedly perjured testimony
    of his ex-wife. Nor was any evidence adduced capable of constituting
    corroboration of the appellant’s allegations as s. 133 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires in prosecutions
    for perjury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    arson charge had to do with a fire at the appellant’s woodworking shop in
    1985.  The appellant’s only key to the
    shop had disappeared before the fire.  His wife had claimed that their child had thrown the key into the
    toilet. While his wife was not at home, the appellant removed the toilet.  He found no key.  The appellant claimed that his wife had given
    the shop key to her (then) boyfriend.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Someone
    from the Office of the Fire Marshall telephoned the appellant to <span
class=GramE>notify  him</span> about a
    fire at his shop.  During this discussion
    the appellant’s ex-wife smiled and appeared to be happy.  The appellant says that this reaction also
    proves that his ex-wife committed arson.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    allegation of fraud related to what the appellant claimed had been fraudulent
    use of his OHIP card to obtain antibiotics for his ex-wife’s friend who had
    come to Canada from Romania to obtain medical care.  The appellant told the justice that his OHIP
    card, along with other items of his identification, had been stolen in 1984.  In 2000, a nurse told him that someone had
    been using his OHIP card.  The appellant
    obtained medical care with a replacement card.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite
    the presence of counsel, the appellant’s responses to questions at the hearing were
    discursive, often unresponsive to the questions and unfocussed. When asked
    about the delay of decades in laying the charges, the appellant responded:
    “it’s a very funny question”.  He
    explained that he wanted to wait until the only child of their marriage had
    grown up to avoid retaliatory measures towards the child by his ex-wife.  By the time the pre-enquete took place, the
    child was 26 years old.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Submissions at the Pre-enquete</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the pre-enquete, counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant had
    adduced evidence that Ilona </span>Vasarhelyi had made untrue statements to a
    justice of the peace on June 8, 1998.  These statements, which included complaints that the appellant beat her,
    persuaded the justice to issue a restraining order against the appellant.  She also lied at the appellant’s trial for
    uttering death threats of which he was convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
    for the appellant urged the justice of the peace to issue process on the
    allegations of arson and fraud. The fire at the workshop had been set by
    someone who had access to the building, since there were no signs of forcible
    entry. The evidence of the appellant pointed to his ex-wife as the only person
    who had access to the keys.  In a similar
    way, the appellant’s ex-wife had exclusive access to the appellant’s
    identification, including his OHIP card. Thus, it was his ex-wife who stole the
    OHIP card and provided it to a mutual friend to obtain medical benefits to
    which the friend was not entitled.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    articling student who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General opposed the
    issuance of process. He pointed out that the appellant had offered no evidence
    of what Ilona </span>Vasarhelyi had actually said in any of the hearings, or
    that what she said was false. Further, the appellant had adduced no evidence
    capable of constituting corroboration as required by s.&nbsp;133 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The agent of the Attorney General contended that
    the appellant had adduced no evidence on the arson charge that there had been an
    actual fire that caused damage to his workshop, let alone a fire set at the
    direction of or with the participation of Ilona Vasarhelyi.  Her smile upon learning of the events was no
    evidence of her participation in them.  Likewise, the link between the appellant’s ex-wife and the theft and
    fraudulent use of his OHIP card, as reported by <span class=GramE>an unnamed
    nurse years</span> later, was unsupported by any evidence.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Decision at the Pre-enquete</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the conclusion of the pre-enquete, the justice decided not to issue
    process.  The nucleus of his reasons for
    refusal appears in this passage:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Now
    you have to understand, the nature of a pre-enquete hearing is to decide
    whether process should be issued, whether these charges can go forward, whether
    the Crown feels that they can prosecute. The very nature of their job is to
    prosecute. They want to prosecute.  So
    when I hear from a Crown that, “Listen, I don’t think that,” my Crown’s opinion
    is that they don’t think there’s evidence here to prosecute, I have to pay very
    close attention to that.  And I do.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>And
    I heard the same evidence today and I did hear a lot of hearsay evidence and
    I’m not satisfied, Mr. Vasarhelyi, that charges can be issued, or process can
    be issued on any of these charges. I’m not satisfied there’s enough evidence in
    the Court today to issue process. So <span class=GramE>process on all three
    charges, sir, are</span> not issued.</span>  </p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Application for <i>Mandamus</i></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant sought an order in lieu of <i>mandamus</i> to compel the justice of the
    peace to issue process on the information. A judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice dismissed the application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of his reasons for judgment, the application
    judge began:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            I
    am mindful that under the provisions of s. 507.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> the applicant must satisfy the justice of the peace
    that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case
    based upon the evidence of a witness or witnesses called on the pre-enquette
    hearing.  The evidence called must be
    admissible at law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge then considered the evidence
    adduced in connection with each charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In connection with the charge of perjury, the
    application judge noted that the only evidence about the falsity of the
    ex-wife’s testimony was the appellant’s opinion that she lied. The judge
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The
    learned justice of the peace I find did not exceed his jurisdiction in electing
    not to issue process on the perjury charges.  In fact, I find the justice of the peace was correct in law in not
    issuing process since there was no evidence of an essential element of the
    offence of perjury; i.e., there was no evidence of corroboration.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that the justice of the
    peace had <i>not</i> committed
    jurisdictional error in failing to issue process on the proposed charge of
    fraud.  The judge reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            In
    regard to the count of fraud, there was no admissible evidence presented at the
    pre-enquette to link his former wife directly to the theft of the OHIP card or
    its subsequent use.  Further, the alleged
    subsequent use was provided by way of a hearsay statement received by the
    applicant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>He added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Further, I am satisfied that the learned justice of
    the peace was again correct in law in concluding that there was insufficient
    evidence to issue process on the fraud charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his rejection of the appellant’s submissions on the
    arson charge, the application  judge
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            In
    examining whether on the totality of the circumstantial evidence if the <i>prima facie</i> test has been met, I must
    note that, first, there was no admissible evidence before the learned justice
    of the peace that could establish that the fire was deliberately set.  Second, what the superintendent is alleged to
    have said to the applicant twenty-four years ago would be inadmissible hearsay.
    Third, the applicant’s belief his former wife set the fire would not be
    admissible evidence at trial but would be speculation.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant submits that the application judge was wrong in concluding that the
    justice had acted within his jurisdiction in refusing to issue process. The
    jurisdictional error left uncorrected by refusal of <i>mandamus</i>, according to the appellant, was that the justice failed
    to consider <i>all </i>the evidence in
    deciding whether to issue process.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Duty
    counsel advanced a different argument on the appellant’s behalf. Ms. Pringle
    submitted that the justice exceeded his jurisdiction by restricting his
    consideration to evidence that would be <i>admissible</i> at a criminal trial. The incorporation of the provisions of s. 540(7) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, by the combined operation
    of ss. 507.1(8) and 507(3)(b), permits the introduction of evidence at the
    pre-enquete that would not otherwise be admissible in a criminal trial. Thus,
    the argument continues, the justice declined jurisdiction when he failed to
    take into account the hearsay evidence given by the appellant in determining
    whether to issue process.</span></p>

    the respondent, Ms. Ficek contends that the appellant has failed to establish
    any jurisdictional default or error here. The justice was simply not persuaded
    that the information offered by the appellant met the standard required for the
    issuance of process. The shortcomings in the appellant’s testimony were not
    limited to hearsay.  What the appellant
    said under oath was rife with speculation, incapable of supporting any rational
    inference that linked the putative accused to the offences alleged.  Nothing said by the appellant was above the
    level of unfounded suspicion.  </span></p>

    Ficek says that the referential incorporation of s. 540(7) into the pre-enquete
    is of no moment in this case.  At bottom,
    evidence inadmissible under traditional rules of admissibility may only be
    relied upon where the justice considers it credible and trustworthy under s.
    540(7) and the notice and disclosure required by s. 540(8) have been provided
    to the Attorney General. The justice, as he was entitled to do, considered it
    neither here. The application judge was right to conclude that the justice had
    committed no jurisdictional error.</span></p>

    citizen. Where, as in this case, the informant is a private citizen,

    speculation and patent animus. It left untouched many, if not most essential
    elements of the offences alleged in the information. On no standard of measure
