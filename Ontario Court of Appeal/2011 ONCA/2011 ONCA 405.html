  <h2 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Background</span></h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. LeBrocq seeks to set aside his convictions on six
    counts of sexual assault.  He was tried
    by a court comprised of Justice L.L. Gauthier sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant alleged that the appellant had sexually
    assaulted her on a number of occasions while he was involved in a romantic
    relationship with her mother.  The
    assaults were said to have ranged from fondling to intercourse and to have
    spanned a period starting when the complainant was 7-10 years old and ending
    when she was 13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he submits that the trial judge erred in
    dismissing his application at the outset of trial to introduce evidence that
    the complainant had previously accused another of the mothers boyfriends of
    sexually assaulting her.  The appellant
    proposed to lead the evidence in order to show that the complainant was
    fabricating her testimony and that she may have been confused about which of
    the boyfriends had sexually assaulted her.  Although defence counsel at trial professed
    that he was not bringing the application under s. 276.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the trial judge treated
    it as such, and rejected it without holding a hearing on the basis that the
    insufficiently-detailed evidence proposed was not capable of being admissible
    under s. 276(2) of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the appellant submits that the cumulative
    effect of a series of allegedly improper comments by Crown counsel during her
    opening and closing addresses to the jury, as well as certain questions during
    cross-examination, rendered the trial unfair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject both grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h3>Dismissal of the s. 276.1 Application Without a Hearing</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 276.1(4)(c), unless there is some basis upon
    which the evidence sought to be admitted satisfies the trial judge that it is
    capable of being admissible under subsection 272(2), the trial judge has no
    obligation to hold a hearing to determine whether that would be the case.  The decision is discretionary and entitled to
    deference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Ecker </i>(1995),
    96 C.C.C. (3d) 161, at pp. 181-82, a majority of the Saskatchewan Court of
    Appeal observed that it is preferable for courts to take a cautious approach to
    establishing the limits of the first stage of the s. 276.1 enquiry, and to
    leave such doubts as may exist regarding the admissibility of the proposed
    evidence to the hearing stage.  Here,
    however, it is apparent from the trial judges reasons that she was satisfied the
    evidence, as presented to her at stage one, was clearly not capable of being of
    being admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that there was insufficient
    detail in the application and supporting affidavit to allow her to determine
    that the proposed evidence was relevant.  The application provided no details of the alleged assaults by the other
    boyfriend or any evidence of whether he had been charged and, if so, the
    outcome of those charges.  In any event,
    the trial judge concluded that, even if the other boyfriend had been tried and
    acquitted, it would not follow that the complainant had fabricated her evidence.  Rather, it would simply show that the Crown
    had failed to prove the charges against the other boyfriend beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  In that sense, the proposed
    evidence was not relevant.  Even if it
    was relevant, the trial judge concluded that it would be inadmissible because
    it was prejudicial and had a significant potential to mislead the jury into an
    impermissible line of reasoning.  She
    therefore dismissed the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the record before her, we see no error in the trial
    judges exercise of discretion in that regard and in her determination that the
    tendered evidence was not capable of being admissible under s. 276(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <h3>The Comments and Questions by Crown Counsel</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor would we give effect to the argument that Crown
    counsels comments in her opening and closing addresses to the jury, together
    with certain of her questions to a defence witness, had the cumulative effect
    of rendering the trial unfair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant isolates one comment made during Crown
    counsels opening submission, in particular, and three during the closing
    address.  He also focuses on certain
    questions posed to a defence witness that he submits were designed to
    improperly bolster the complainants credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No objection was made to any of these comments or
    questions by defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Frost), nor did trial counsel
    seek any corrective instruction or apply for a mistrial.  These concerns are raised for the first time
    on appeal.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Questions to Defence Witness</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a brief cross-examination of one of the defence
    witnesses, Crown counsel elicited responses indicating that the complainant was
    a good student and a smart and intelligent girl with a lot of potential.  In the context of the evidence as it unfolded
    at trial, we do not consider these questions put to the defence witness as
    amounting to impermissible oath helping.  Crown counsel is entitled to put a human face on the complainant within
    limits.  Moreover, the same evidence had
    already been elicited by defence counsel during the witness
    examination-in-chief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><u>The Crowns Opening</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsels comments in her opening address were
    similarly benign, in our view.  She
    outlined some biographical background showing that the complainant had had a
    difficult upbringing and  in the passage particularly impugned  she said:
    Now, when you hear [the complainants] evidence and story, I want you to keep
    an open mind and remember that she is young and shes just trying to survive in
    this world.  The appellant submits that
    the tenor of this presentation was to put the complainant in a sympathetic
    light and therefore to bolster her credibility improperly in a case where
    credibility was central.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Crown, however, that the presentation
    did little more than introduce the jury to who the complainant was and to
    provide some context for the allegations made.  In addition, any difficulties were adequately offset by the trial
    judges general instructions to the jury that the views of counsel were not
    evidence, that the jurors must arrive at their own conclusions on the evidence,
    and that they were to do so without sympathy for either party or prejudice. </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Crowns Closing</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor are we satisfied that the comments complained of in
    Crown counsels closing address, taken alone or cumulatively with the other
    impugned comments, led to any unfairness in the trial.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Motive</span></i>  </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her closing, Crown counsel referred to the absence
    of motive to fabricate.  She stated, [t]he
    defence pointed out no motive for [the complainant] to fabricate, and coupled
    that comment with the related rhetorical question, Where is the motive for her
    to fabricate, and appear here and tell you about these embarrassing things?  The appellant submits that this reference
    irretrievably poisoned the jurors thinking process because it may have invited
    them to conclude that the onus had shifted to the defence to prove a lack of
    motive or that the absence of proof of motive must have meant the complainant
    was telling the truth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, we disagree.  In the circumstances of this particular case, we do not think that these
    comments were unfair to the defence or that they required a corrective instruction.
     Fabrication was the centrepiece of the
    appellants defence and defence counsel went to the jury entirely on the basis
    that the complainant was lying and had made up her evidence.  The Crown is entitled to counter that defence
    within limits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a difference between pointing to the absence
    of evidence  as Crown counsel did here  and suggesting in a flourish of
    rhetoric that the defence should have called evidence demonstrating such a
    motive and failed to do so, or that the Crown had proven the lack of motive to
    fabricate.  Crown counsels comments may
    have been close to the line, but, when they are considered in context, we do
    not believe they would have led the jury to believe that there was any shift in
    the onus of proof, or a requirement on the defence to point to a motive to
    fabricate or anything else.  Nothing in
    Crown counsels closing remarks would have invited the jury to reason that the
    absence of a demonstrated motive to lie necessarily means there was no motive,
    or that the absence of a motive to fabricate necessarily means the complainant
    must have been telling the truth.  See <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 321
    (C.A.), at para. 121; <i>R v. L.L.</i> (2009), 96 O.R. (3d) 412 (C.A.). This is not a case like <i>L.L.</i>, where Crown counsels remarks were particularly directive and
    egregious.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury would have been aware of the trial judges
    clear instruction that there was no onus on the defence to call any evidence or
    to prove the appellants innocence.  In
    addition, defence counsels lack of objection and the absence of any request
    for a corrective instruction are telling of the impact that defence counsel felt
    the comments may have had.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Erectile Dysfunction</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A key element of the appellants defence at trial that
    the complainant was fabricating her story was his evidence that he was
    suffering from erectile dysfunction during the years when he is said to have
    committed the sexual assaults.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel attacked this defence, and in her closing
    remarks alluded to a number of inconsistencies in the appellants evidence
    regarding the timing of his erectile difficulties and the consequent cessation
    of sexual relations with the mother.  The
    appellant submits that Crown counsel misstated the evidence (which, he says, originated
    from an unfair line of questioning at trial).  We do not agree that Crown counsel misstated the appellants evidence in
    any material fashion, or that her statements resulted from an improper line of
    questioning (we observe again that no objection was raised at trial about the Crowns
    line of questioning).  We are satisfied
    that Crown counsels statements did not lead to any unfairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was some evidence to support the appellants
    evidence that he had erectile difficulties.  The complainant was apparently aware of it, and said so at one point in
    her testimony.  In Crown counsels closing
    to the jury, she asked how the complainant would have known this intimate
    detail about this man if he wasnt engaging in sexual acts with her?  She characterized this as the most powerful
    evidence in the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant objects to these comments on the basis
    that they called for speculation on the part of the jury, because there was no
    evidence about how the complainant became aware of the appellants
    problems.  In oral argument, the appellants
    counsel framed the issue in <i>Browne v.
    Dunn</i> terms,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> submitting that the Crown had never advanced the position before closing that
    it would argue the sole possible source of the complainants awareness was
    direct experience (as opposed, for example, to overhearing it being discussed
    by her mother and the appellant during the years they lived together).  Mr. Frost submitted that it was incumbent on
    the Crown, had it intended to advance this position, to raise this issue in
    evidence by at least questioning the mother about it, before using the argument
    in closing.  Hence, the <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> analogy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The stumbling block with this argument is that it was <i>the appellant</i> who elicited the evidence
    of the complainants knowledge of the appellants erectile difficulties.  In cross-examination she responded to a
    series of questions by noting that there were times when the appellant could
    not get it up.  The defence having brought
    this evidence out, there was no obligation on the Crown to pursue it, or to ask
    any other witnesses about it.  The
    principle of <i>Brown v. Dunn</i> has no
    application.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The Role of Crown Counsel</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant objects to Crown counsels
    statement in closing that: My duty is to test his evidence.  Im not trying to be mean to him or make him
    look bad.  I have to test the veracity
    and truth of what he says.  I have duties
    to the court[.]  The appellant says this
    comment had the potential to impermissibly elevate the Crown in the jurys eyes
    by suggesting that Crown counsel was impartial and that her submissions were
    motivated by her duty to the court to test the veracity of the appellants
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These comments were not improper in our view.  In fact they accurately reflect the duty and
    obligation of Crown counsel and her position at trial, and did not reflect
    adversely in any way on either the appellant or his trial counsel.</p>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, no trial unfairness flowed from the
    impugned comments and questions of Crown counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
