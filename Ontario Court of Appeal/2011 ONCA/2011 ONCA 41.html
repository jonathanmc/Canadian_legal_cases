  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions for three counts
    of sexual interference. He alleges the assistance he received from his counsel
    at trial was ineffective, basing his claim primarily on his counsels failure
    to watch video recordings of interviews of the complainants and other witnesses
    prior to trial and his failure to interview two witnesses suggested to him by
    the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree. Although trial counsel took several useful
    steps early in these proceedings, including obtaining an early trial date in accordance
    with his clients instructions, he clearly did not properly prepare for the
    trial, a fact he practically admitted when cross-examined for this appeal
    because it was a very busy time in his practice. In particular, he failed to
    respond to a fundamental change in one of the complainants mothers version of
    how one of the complainants disclosed the alleged sexual assault. The
    fundamental change would have been readily apparent from viewing the video
    statement of the mother to the police, or even from the Crowns summary of that
    statement.  On the record, we conclude
    that trial counsels failure to respond flowed from his almost complete lack of
    preparation for trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, having agreed that the complainants evidence
    at trial could be introduced by way of their videotaped statements to the
    police, trial counsel did not review them at all before the trial. As a result,
    he was not able to consider the best way to structure his cross-examination of
    the complainants. Moreover, he essentially had to wing it when it came to
    cross-examining the complainants, which is plainly inadequate in relation to
    the key witnesses against his client in a serious criminal prosecution. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the appellant provided his counsel with
    the names of and contact information for two witnesses who would testify in his
    favour about the events that gave rise to the criminal charges. The fresh
    evidence establishes that they would have been willing witnesses and would have
    testified in support of the accuseds position. Counsel did not interview these
    people and did not call them as witnesses. The trial judge, in his reasons for
    judgment, drew an adverse inference against the accused for failure to call one
    of these witnesses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These three key omissions on the part of trial counsel
    clearly flowed from failure to properly prepare for trial in the late summer
    after the trial counsel had successfully obtained a very early trial date for
    his client. The omissions are sufficiently serious that we cannot say that the
    appellant did not suffer prejudice. Indeed, in our view, this trial was simply
    not a fair trial for the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed and the convictions for three
    counts of sexual interference are set aside. The Crown does not seek a new
    trial. Accordingly, the charges are stayed.</p>
