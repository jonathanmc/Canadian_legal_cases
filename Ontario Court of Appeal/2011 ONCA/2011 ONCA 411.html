  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Mary <span class=SpellE>Maccaroni</span>,
    alleges she was injured in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on February
    16, 2003, when the car in which she was a passenger was rear-ended by a vehicle
    operated by Kevin Kelly and owned by his mother Donna Ainsworth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the accident, the Ainsworth vehicle was
    insured by the Co-operators General Insurance Company (Co-operators).  That policy had third party liability limits
    of $1,000,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span class=SpellE>Maccaronis</span>’ vehicle was
    at the time insured by ING/Halifax Insurance Company of Canada (ING).  That policy had what is known as an OPCF 44R
    endorsement. This endorsement provided additional coverage in the event that
    injuries were occasioned to the policyholder in circumstances where the
    tortfeasor was either uninsured or underinsured, in the sense that the limits
    of coverage under OPCF 44R were greater than the third party liability limits
    of coverage available to the tortfeasor. The OPCF 44R endorsement also had
    coverage limits of $1,000,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants issued a statement of claim on October
    1, 2003.  In that claim, the appellants named
    the <span class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span> Kevin Kelly and his mother, Donna
    Ainsworth, the operator and owner, respectively, of the Ainsworth vehicle.  They also named ING, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Maccaroni’s</span> own insurer, pursuant to the OPCF 44R endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Co-operators obtained an order adding itself as a statutory
    third party pursuant to the provisions of s. 258 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. I.8.<i> </i>It took the position that Mr. Kelly’s driver’s licence was
    suspended at the time of the accident and that Ms. Ainsworth permitted Mr. Kelly
    to operate her motor vehicle when she knew or ought to have known that Mr. Kelly
    did not have a valid driver’s licence. Co-operators further alleged that
    neither Mr. Kelly nor Ms. Ainsworth co-operated in the investigation of the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the breach of statutory conditions it
    alleged, Co-operators denied liability under its contract of insurance and took
    the position that its liability to third parties was limited to $200,000
    pursuant to s. 258(11) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the appellants settled their action with
    the tortfeasors and Co-operators in exchange for the statutory minimum limits
    of $200,000.  ING neither consented to
    the settlement nor to the dismissal of the action against the tortfeasors and Co-operators.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  ING took the position that the appellants’
    damages, in any event, did not exceed the $200,000 they had been paid by
    Co-operators, and specifically rejected the off-coverage position Co-operators
    had taken. As part of the settlement, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Maccaroni</span> signed a final release wherein she specifically released Kevin Kelly, Donna
    Ainsworth and the Co-operators in respect of any and all claims arising out of
    the February 16, 2003 motor vehicle accident.  Further, she agreed that the payment did not constitute any admission of
    liability on the part of the three <span class=SpellE>releasees</span> and
    declared that the payment was:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]<span class=SpellE>ccepted</span> voluntarily
    for the purpose of making a full and final compromise, adjustment and
    settlement of all claims for losses and damages resulting or to result from the
    said incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants then sought to recover the additional
    money to which they claimed entitlement from ING pursuant to the OPCF 44R
    endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 18, 2010, ING brought a motion for summary
    judgment, pursuant to Rule 20 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>Reg</span>. 194, to
    dismiss the appellants’ action as against ING on the grounds that there was no
    genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the motion, ING took the position that there had
    never been a legal determination of the off-coverage position taken by
    Co-operators and, accordingly, Co-operators’ limit of liability was never
    reduced by “operation of law” or otherwise from the certificate amount of
    $1,000,000 to the statutory minimum limit of $200,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, ING argued that no such legal determination
    could now be made because the appellants had released both tortfeasors and
    Co-operators from the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge accepted both positions argued by ING.
    He found there was no genuine issue requiring a trial and granted summary
    judgment dismissing the action against ING.</p>

    event she is involved in an accident in circumstances where the limit of

    liability limits of the tortfeasor whose actions caused her injuries.  In the event the policyholder’s damages
    exceed the third party liability coverage, then the policyholder can recover

    THAT in the event an insurer’s liability under a policy is reduced by operation

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issue here is really whether the Co-operators’ liability limits are “reduced by
    operation of law” merely on its say so or because of a settlement reached
    without the consent of the OPCF 44R insurer.  In other words, is it enough to allege breach of policy conditions to
    reduce the liability limits of coverage available to pay third party claimants
    and then settle by paying the reduced limits? I think not. </span>The words “by
    operation of law” must have some meaning beyond a liability insurer merely
    taking an off-coverage position and settling on this basis. The third party
    liability coverage is intended as first loss insurance and the OPCF 44R as
    excess. Therefore, there must be a legal determination that the third party
    liability coverage has been limited before the OPCF 44R excess coverage becomes
    available<span lang=EN-US>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    alleging policy violation and adding itself as statutory third party, the
    insurer who takes an off-coverage position, as Co-operators did here, merely
    preserves its position.  It will then be
    an issue to be determined in the subsequent litigation.  If the insurer’s position is borne out by the
    evidence and it is proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the insured has
    breached the conditions of the policy, then the liability policy limits will be
    reduced accordingly by virtue of s. 258(11) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> to the statutory minimum limits.  It is the effect of s. 258(11) of the Act that
    reduces the limits of the policy to the statutory minimum where it is
    determined there has been a breach of a policy condition “by operation of
    law”.  Until there is a finding, however,
    the insurer’s allegation of policy violation is merely that, an unproved
    allegation, and the policy limit will remain that set out in the insured’s
    policy.</span></p>

    25 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    agree with ING that there never has been a legal determination with respect to
    the off-coverage position taken by Co-operators and that therefore Co-operators
    limit of liability was never reduced by <i>operation

    minimum of $200,000.</span></p>

    only remaining question is whether the appellants’ action against ING can proceed.  The motion judge held it could not.  He concluded at <span class=SpellE>para</span>.
    26 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>And
    I further agree with ING’s argument that no such legal determination can now be
    made, since the plaintiff has released the tortfeasors and Co-operators from
    this action.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge was of the view that the Co-operators’ off-coverage position could
    only be determined in an action where Co-operators and its policyholders, the <span
class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span>, were parties.  I do not agree with this conclusion.  In my view, there is no reason why the appellants’ action against ING
    may not proceed. It will be for the appellants to prove their entitlement to
    recover from ING and they will have to prove Co-operators’ off-coverage
    position in order to do so.  The fact
    that Co-operators and the tortfeasors are not parties to the proceeding is of
    no moment.  The <span class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span> and representatives of Co-operators can be called as witnesses and can be
    examined under oath as non-parties: </span>see rules 31.10 and 53.04 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i><span
lang=EN-US>.  While a factual finding made in respect of the coverage issue will bind
    neither Co-operators nor the tortfeasors vis-à-vis the appellants in view of
    the release, such a finding can determine, as between the appellants and ING,
    whether the appellants are entitled to recover anything from ING.  If the appellants are successful and
    establish that the <span class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span> were in breach of
    their policy provisions and hence, that the off-coverage position taken by
    Co-operators is correct, they may be entitled to recover from ING.  If they are not successful, their action will
    be dismissed and they will, absent exceptional circumstances, be liable for the
    costs of those proceedings.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Furthermore,
    it is, I think, arguable on the basis of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision
    in <i>Somersall v. Friedman</i>, [2002] 3
    S.C.R. 109, that the appellants may well have a claim against ING in spite of
    their settlement agreement with Co-operators and the tortfeasors. The plaintiffs
    in <span class=SpellE><i>Somersall</i></span><i> </i>had settled their claims with the third
    party liability insurer for the policy limits and agreed not to pursue the
    tortfeasor for any amount over those limits.  They then sought to recover their damages, over and above those policy
    limits from their own insurer under a SEF 44 endorsement (similar to <span
class=GramE>a</span> OPCF 44R endorsement).  The majority concluded, on the facts of that case, that the plaintiffs’
    settlement did not bar their right to pursue their own insurer for damages
    claimed above the settlement figure.</span></p>

    is not to say, however, that an argument cannot be made that <span
class=SpellE><i>Somersall</i></span> does
    not apply.  The facts in <span
class=SpellE><i>Somersall</i></span> differ
    from the facts in this case.  Significantly, in <span class=SpellE><i>Somersall</i></span>,
    the plaintiffs’ agreement with the third party liability insurer was for the
    full limits of that policy – there is no suggestion that the agreement was for
    minimum statutory limits only.<a href="#_ftn3"

'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  That, of course, is not this case where there
    is a potential of an additional $800,000 of coverage available as excess insurance.
    It is significant that in <i>Somersall</i> there was no issue that the tortfeasor was inadequately insured.  His policy limits were less than the SEF 44
    limits and accordingly all the insured claimants had to prove in their claim
    against their insurer (SEF 44 insurer) was that they were: “Legally entitled to
    recover from an inadequately insured motorist.” Further, the court in <span
class=SpellE><i>Somersall</i></span><i> </i>seemed to lay particular emphasis on
    the fact that the <span class=SpellE>tortfeasor</span> had no “capacity to
    compensate” the plaintiffs or was “impecunious”.  The record in the present case does not show
    whether the <span class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span> are impecunious. Thus, it
    would seem, the law is not settled on this point.</span></p>
