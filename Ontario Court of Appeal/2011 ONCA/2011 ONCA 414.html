  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, the third ranked secured creditor of the
    respondents, appeals the order of Brown J. dated April 13, 2011, granting the
    motion of the respondents’ court appointed receiver for approval of a proposed
    purchase agreement and technology license agreement and approving the reports,
    activities, conduct and decisions of the receiver.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 18, 2011, Newbould J. rejected the receiver’s
    proposal to sell en block the assets of <span class=SpellE>Ambercore</span>,
    and its wholly owned subsidiary, <span class=SpellE>Terrapoint</span>. The
    appellant says that nothing has changed between that date and the order
    appealed from. We do not agree. We see the proposal that was approved by
    Justice Brown as being different from the proposal before Justice Newbould. The
    new proposal is different in several respects. For example, the receiver
    retains <span class=SpellE>Terrapoint’s</span> accounts receivable, cash, and
    work in progress; <span class=SpellE>Ambercore</span> retains ownership of its
    intellectual property; and time has <span class=GramE>passed,</span> so much so
    that the time to conduct a new sales process would preclude sale of <span
class=SpellE>Terrapoint</span> as a going concern. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge considered the receiver’s conduct and
    the reasons for not engaging in a further sales process (but rather pursuing the
    sale of <span class=SpellE>Terrapoint</span> on its own), the submissions of
    other creditors and the sale price in light of the valuation of the most
    significant asset. He considered the expert evidence led by the appellant and
    the receiver’s report outlining the change in circumstances from February 2011.
    He concluded as follows at <span class=SpellE>paras</span>. 33, 34 and 41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that since the release of the
    Reasons of Newbould J., the Receiver has used sufficient efforts, appropriate
    in the circumstances, to pursue the sale of the assets.  Some degree of urgency surrounded the need to
    secure the sale of <span class=SpellE>Terrapoint</span> while still a going
    concern, so the Receiver’s decision to pursue the sale of <span class=SpellE>Terrapoint</span> on its own was reasonable.  Further, it
    is apparent that the Receiver has tried to take into account the interests of
    all parties, giving due recognition to the overall amount of liabilities
    attaching to both companies and the priorities amongst the secured creditors,
    and it has attempted to consult with the secured parties to ensure a fair sales
    process.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As to the proposed transaction, I am satisfied that
    the price in the Purchase Agreement, together with the allocation of the
    purchase price, when measured against the valuations obtained by the Receiver,
    is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Balancing all these factors, I conclude that the
    Receiver has acted prudently and reasonably in its efforts to secure the sale
    of some of the assets since the release of the decision of Newbould J. and that
    the sale process, and the resulting proposed Purchase Agreement and associated
    Technology License Agreement, satisfy the principles set out in the <span
class=SpellE><i>Soundair</i></span> decision.&nbsp; Accordingly, I approve the
    proposed sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge appropriately applied the analysis in <i>Royal Bank v. <span class=SpellE>Soundair</span></i> in approving the sale agreement and technology license agreement. He explained
    why the proposed transaction was reasonable in the new circumstances, including
    why the earlier concerns were either addressed by the receiver’s subsequent
    actions or outweighed by the changed facts at the time of the motion before
    him. Given the deference that must be given to his decision, we see neither an
    error in principle nor any reason to interfere with his exercise of discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed. Costs of $20,000 to be paid by
    the appellant to the receiver inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
