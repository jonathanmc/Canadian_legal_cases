    return to Mexico as arranged, instead remaining in Toronto with her father, her
    aunt and her aunt’s same-sex </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span class=GramE>spouse</span>.  In May 2010, the girl was found to be a
    refugee by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Refugee Protection Division
    (the “IRB”) by reason of abuse by her mother.  Shortly thereafter, the father was denied refugee status in Canada and
    moved to Norway.</p>

    her aunt’s spouse for about 18 months, the mother brought a Hague Convention
    application in Ontario for an order compelling the girl’s return to
    Mexico.  The father and the paternal aunt
    were served with the application, although the father was the only named
    respondent.  The aunts, who had commenced
    a custody application, moved for an order adding them as parties and appointing
    counsel for the girl or <span class=GramE>an <i>amicus</i></span><i> curiae</i> in
    the Hague Convention application.  Their
    motion was denied.</span></p>

    timely notice of the hearing date.  The hearing
    eventually proceeded on an uncontested basis, with none of the father, the
    aunts or the girl participating.</span></p>

    girl was being wrongfully retained in Ontario and granted an order for her
    summary and immediate return to Mexico.  The
    girl was then almost 14 years of age.  About one month later, she was removed from her school in Toronto with
    the assistance of the police, placed in the care of her mother, and flown to
    Mexico despite her protests and without notice to the father or the aunts.  Although she informed the police and others
    present that she was a Convention refugee, the girl was denied permission to
    return home to retrieve her refugee papers.  She was not allowed to communicate with anyone in any way.  This included her aunts, with whom she had
    been residing for the prior 21 months.  Apart entirely from the legality of the girl’s removal, the manner in
    which it was <span class=GramE>effected</span> offended the girl’s right to
    dignity and respect.  It also had the
    potential to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.  We take note of the evidence of the concerns
    and outrage of the girl’s school principal and of her fellow students at the
    circumstances surrounding her removal.</span></p>

    difficult legal issues raised, this court released its decision with brief
    reasons on April 18, 2011, with full reasons to follow.  In that decision, the court allowed the
    appeal, set aside the order of return and directed that a new Hague Convention
    hearing be held.  The court also directed
    the parties to do everything within their power to co-operate and facilitate
    the child’s return to Ontario to participate in the new hearing.  These are the full reasons for the court’s decision.</span></p>

    Mexico, where they both lived until the father moved to Canada in 2006.  There is one child of the marriage, J.R.I.
    (the “child”), who was born in Mexico on December 31, 1996.  In July 2000, the father and the mother entered
    into a separation agreement, which was subsequently incorporated into a final
    consent divorce decree issued by the Family Court of Cancun on January 11,
    2001.  The parties accept that, under the
    agreement and divorce decree, the mother was granted legal custody of the
    child.  The father was granted access
    rights and obliged to pay monthly child support.  </span></p>

    honoured his child support obligations only until sometime in 2002.  In 2006, he moved to Mexico City and then to
    Canada.  Throughout, the child continued
    to live in Cancun with her mother and, later, with her mother, her step-father,

    Toronto on December 24, 2008, accompanied by her maternal grandmother (the “grandmother”),
    and one of her maternal uncles.  Return

    returned alone to Cancun, leaving the child in Toronto with her father and the aunts,
    without the mother’s consent.  The mother
    claims that the father initially assured her that the child’s departure was
    merely delayed due to a scheduled dental appointment and later offered various
    excuses for the continuing delay in arranging for the child to return to Mexico.  The mother alleges that she had difficulty
    reaching the child directly and that, after February 2009, she was out of
    contact with her for approximately three months. </span></p>

    interviews conducted by the OCL with the child on April 3 and 4, 2011.  In her interviews, the child said that it had
    been “scary for her” since her return to Mexico.  She described only one incident of physical
    abuse (when her mother allegedly hit her with a towel), but said that her
    mother had made veiled threats that the abuse would continue once the
    proceedings in Canada concluded.  She
    also said that her mother was “treating her badly emotionally” and had greatly
    restricted her mobility and contact with relatives, including her grandmother
    whom she had not seen in three months.  She repeated her wish to return to Canada to live with her aunts.  This account is largely repeated in a report

    unaware of her whereabouts.  However,

    2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 69, the Supreme Court of Canada explained that provincial
    legislation that is incompatible with federal legislation will be “rendered

    onus is on the party arguing paramountcy to establish “either that it is

    the Supreme Court’s recent decision in <i>Németh</i> is dispositive of this issue.  In <i>Németh</i>, the Supreme Court held, at
    paras. 24-31, that “removal” under s.&nbsp;115 of the IRPA refers to removal
    processes under the IRPA, and does not apply to removal from Canada by
    surrender for extradition.  On the
    authority of <i>Németh</i>, therefore, the
    prohibition on removal under s. 115 does not apply to removals effected under
    entirely different statutory schemes – in this case, under the Hague Convention’s
    mandatory return process.  On this basis,
    there is no operational conflict between s. 115 of the IRPA and s. 46 of the

    the purpose of Canada’s international <i>non-refoulement</i> obligations under s. 115 of the IRPA.  We
    turn again to the Supreme Court’s reasoning in <i>Németh</i>.  At para. 33,
    Cromwell J., writing for the court, accepted that the broadly cast language of
    art. 33 of the Refugee Convention, which prohibits the removal of a refugee “in
    any manner whatsoever”, applies to expulsion by extradition.  </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'> also affirms that, where
    possible, statutes should be interpreted in a manner consistent with Canada’s
    international treaty obligations and principles of international law.  As Cromwell J. indicated, at para. 34, it is
    therefore presumed that “the legislature acts in compliance with Canada’s
    obligations as a signatory of international treaties and as a member of the
    international community as well as in conformity with the values and principles
    of customary and conventional international law” (citations omitted). </span></p>

    fully satisfied by interpreting and applying s. 44(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
    of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c.
    18, which requires that a surrender be refused where it would be “unjust or
    oppressive having regard to all the relevant circumstances”, as preventing the
    surrender of a refugee who faces a well-founded risk of persecution.  This provision, together with general due
    process requirements at common law and under the <i>Charter</i>, prevents surrender of a refugee where to do so would
    offend the principles of fundamental justice.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This reasoning is apposite here.  As in the extradition context, the principle
    of <i>non-refoulement</i> is directly
    implicated where the return of a refugee child under the Hague Convention is
    sought.  Nothing in the IRPA purports to
    exempt child refugees from the application of s. 115 in a Hague Convention
    case.  Nor does <span class=GramE>the</span> Hague Convention purport to elevate its mandatory return policy above the
    principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>In our view, properly interpreted, the Hague Convention contemplates
    respect for and fulfillment of Canada’s <i>non-refoulement</i> obligations.  Specifically, art. 13(b) of
    the Hague Convention permits the refusal of an order of return concerning a
    child, who would otherwise be automatically returnable under art. 12, if “there
    is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological
    harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation”.  In addition, art. 20 <span class=GramE>provides</span> for the denial of an order of return if it would not be permitted “by the
    fundamental principles of the requested state relating to the protection of human
    rights and fundamental freedoms”.  In
    accordance with the interpretive principles set out above, arts. 13(b) and 20
    must be construed in a manner that takes account of the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>. </span></p>

    Convention stipulate that a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in light
    of its context, object and </span>purpose and any applicable rules of
    international law.  Consequently, under
    the Vienna Convention principles of treaty interpretation, the interpretation of
    the Hague Convention, which came into force in 1983, must take account of the
    Refugee Convention of 1951, as a relevant rule of international law in force at
    the time of entry into force of the Hague Convention.  This </p>

    fundamental rule of constitutional interpretation that, ‘[w]hen a federal
    statute can be properly interpreted so as not to interfere with a provincial
    statute, such an interpretation is to be applied in preference to another
    applicable construction which would bring about a conflict between the two
    statutes” (citation omitted).  It follows
    that, in construing s. 46 of the CLRA, the courts should avoid finding conflict
    with s. 115 of the IRPA where an alternate interpretation would avoid any
    collision between the two statutes.</span></p>

    construing Canada’s “fundamental principles … relating to the protection of
    human rights and fundamental freedoms” as including the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>.  Under both s. 115 of the IRPA and its
    international human rights obligations, Canada is prohibited from engaging in the <i>refoulement</i> of Convention refugees,
    including refugee children.  Consequently, the exception to return under art. 20 <span class=GramE>is</span> engaged in cases involving refugee children.  In a similar fashion, recognition of the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> is achieved under art. 13(b)
    of the Hague Convention by assigning appropriate weight to the decision of a
    competent Canadian authority, like the IRB, to accept refugee status for a
    child.</span></p>

    determination on a Hague application?  In
    order to grant a refugee claim, the IRB must be satisfied, on a balance of
    probabilities, based on evidence that it regards as trustworthy and reliable,
    that a refugee claimant faces a reasonable chance of persecution.  Given its expertise and specialized
    knowledge, the decisions of the IRB on fact and credibility-driven issues are
    accorded a high degree of deference by the courts: see <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>,

    notice of the IRB hearing and no opportunity to participate, including no
    opportunity to respond to the serious allegations of abuse made against her.  Further, pursuant to s. 170(g) of the IRPA,
    the IRB is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence.  It may therefore receive and base a decision
    on untested evidence adduced in the proceeding: see <i>Kovacs v. Kovacs</i> (2002), 50 O.R. (3d) 671 (S.C.), at para. 82.  In these circumstances, there is potential
    for the abuse of the IRB refugee determination process by an abducting parent
    to gain tactical advantage in a looming or pending custody battle.  The courts must therefore be alert to any
    attempt to misuse the refugee protection scheme at the cost of Canada’s

    a risk of persecution on return of the child to his or her country of habitual

    Hague application, the IRB had concluded that the child was at sufficient risk
    of persecution, due to harm at the hands of her mother, to warrant recognition of
    refugee status.  In these circumstances,
    while the IRB ruling granting refugee status to the child was not dispositive of
    whether the grave risk of harm exception to return under art. 13(b) of the

    status prior to proceeding with her Hague application.  Resort to this process, it is urged, would
    ensure that full respect is accorded to the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>, while also permitting <i>viva voce</i> testimony and the presentation of other evidence by

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>We reject this argument.  First, the Supreme Court held in <i>Németh</i>,
    at para. 51, that the Refugee Convention does not bind contracting states to
    any particular process “for either granting or withdrawing refugee
    status”.  As a result, the court
    indicated, extraditing a Convention refugee without first setting aside a
    finding of refugee status “is not problematic from an international law point
    of view, provided that the extradition authorities give due weight to the
    obligation of <i>non-refoulement</i> by
    fairly examining the question of whether the risk of persecution persists”: <i>Németh</i> at para. 52.  These comments are equally applicable to
    proceedings under the Hague Convention.  There
    is therefore no need for the IRPA process to ‘trump’ <span class=GramE>the</span> Hague Convention regime. </span></p>

    are intended to be summary in nature.  There
    is no assurance that this would necessarily be achieved under the IRPA process
    for revocation of refugee status.  In
    addition, an aggrieved custodial parent of a refugee child cannot apply
    directly to the IRB to vacate a decision allowing a child’s claim for refugee
    protection.  Under s. 109(1) of the IRPA,
    only the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may apply to the IRB for this
    purpose, and the Minister’s power is discretionary.  We therefore do not agree that resort to IRPA
    procedures affords a ‘process advantage’ over the Hague Convention scheme.</span></p>

    refugee status accorded by the IRB to a child affected by a Hague Convention
    application gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the removal of the
    child from Canada will expose the child to a risk of persecution, that is, to a
    risk of harm.  In these circumstances,
    Canada’s <i>non-refoulement</i> obligations
    and the import of a child’s refugee status must be considered under the art. 13(b)

    abuse by her mother, and concluded that she had rebutted the strong presumption

    the Supreme Court held, in respect of refugee claimants, that due to the severe

    “well-founded fear of persecution”, it is “unthinkable that [s. 7 of] the <i>Charter</i> would not apply to entitle them
    to fundamental justice in the adjudication of their status”.  The Supreme Court has also recognized that s.

    it is sought to detain a permanent resident or foreign national on national
    security grounds or to remove a Canadian citizen or a Convention refugee from
    Canada under the IRPA and extradition processes: see <i>Charkaoui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 2007

    is sought.  As a result, the return of a
    refugee child under the Hague Convention must be <span class=GramE>effected</span> in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  As a matter of procedural protection, these

    child himself, but for his concern not “to make it worse”.  Having expressed these concerns, it appears
    that the application judge was satisfied that the available evidence regarding the
    child’s circumstances was adequate and sufficiently current.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>With respect, in so
    concluding, the application judge erred.  Although it detailed her allegations of abuse and aspects of the
    procedural history of the case, the evidentiary record contained virtually no
    specific information about the child’s life in Toronto.  After nearly two years in Toronto, her actual
    circumstances at the time of the Hearing were highly relevant.</span></p>

    refugee, the views of the child gain greater importance.  As the exercise of authority to return the
    child to Mexico engaged her s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights, her return could only be <span class=GramE>effected</span> in
    accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  Those principles required that her views be
    considered on the Hague application in accordance with her age and maturity:
    see <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Németh</i> at para. 70.  The fact
    that the child was not a party to the application does not detract from her
    right to be heard.  </span></p>

    by two further considerations.  First, s.
    64(1) of the CLRA states that the court “where possible shall take into
    consideration the views and preferences of the child to the extent that the
    child is able to express them”, and s. 64(2) authorizes the court to interview
    the child “to determine the views and preferences of the child.”  While s. 64 applies in the context of
    custody, access and guardianship proceedings, recognition of the child’s right
    to be heard on <span class=GramE>the</span> Hague application conforms with the
    spirit and intent of s. 64 of the CLRA: see <i>De

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Second, art. 12(1) of the
    CRC stipulates that the views of a child are to be given due weight according
    to the child’s age and maturity and that a child has the right “to express
    those views freely in all matters affecting the child”.  Article 12(2) of the CRC confirms this right
    in the context of “judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child”.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>At almost 14 years of age, the
    child in this case was clearly of an age and potential maturity such that her
    objection to return to Mexico had to be considered.  The Hearing transcript reveals that the
    application judge recognized this.  He indicated
    that the child’s objection was not the “deciding factor” but went on to observe
    that, “[T]here is a 13 year old or a 14 year old who we are making decisions
    about and she has had no direct involvement.”  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In response, counsel argued that
    the Hague Convention did not give the child “the right to be directly
    involved”, that it merely required that “her voice ought to be heard in
    appropriate circumstances”, and that “her voice [had] been heard”.  Once again, unfortunately, the application
    judge accepted these submissions without further inquiry.  </span></p>

    error.  Given the child’s age, the nature
    of her objection, her status as a Convention refugee, the length of time that
    she had been in Toronto, and the absence of any meaningful current information
    regarding her actual circumstances in Toronto at the date of the Hearing, her
    views concerning a return to her mother’s care in Mexico were a proper and

    of the child’s stay in Toronto (approximately 21 months) and of her mother’s
    delay in commencing her Hague application in Ontario (about 18 months), the
    question arose in this case as to whether the mother had eventually “acquiesced”

    added, “I think the Central Authority actually sat on this for a while before
    doing anything about it.”  The first

    denied acquiescence and offered an explanation for the delay in bringing her

    insufficient to establish acquiescence under art. 13(a): see <i>Ibrahim v. Girgis</i> (2008), 232 O.A.C. 191

    procedural fairness underlie the procedural protections required by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> and that those protections must
    be applied “in a manner sensitive to the context of specific factual
    situations”.  In <i>Németh</i>, at para. 70, the court held that these protections “generally
    [include] adequate disclosure of the case against the person sought, a
    reasonable opportunity to respond to it and a reasonable opportunity to state

    meaningful procedural protections must be afforded to the child.  In our view, these include the right to: (1) receive
    notice of the application; (2) receive adequate disclosure of the case for an
    order of return; (3) a reasonable opportunity to respond to that case: (4) a
    reasonable opportunity to have his or her views on the merits of the

style='line-height:200%'>Given the strong commitment under <span class=GramE>the</span> Hague Convention to expeditious proceedings and
    the need for the prompt return of an abducted child, this court has repeatedly
    recognized that the receipt of <i>viva voce</i> evidence on a Hague application should occur only in exceptional circumstances: <i>Cannock</i> at paras. 33-37; <i>Katsigiannis</i> at para. 59.  Moreover, even in cases where s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> is in play, an oral hearing is

    issues of credibility are involved, fundamental justice requires that those
    issues be determined on the basis of an oral hearing: <i>Singh</i> at para. 59.  This

    conflicting evidence as to whether the child was the victim of abuse by her
    mother.  However, the child was accepted
    as a Convention refugee on the basis of that abuse and her abuse allegations
    have now been corroborated by affidavit evidence from her grandmother and, to a
    certain extent, by other fresh evidence filed with this court.  In the face of that evidence, the mother’s
    continued denial of any abuse of the child will require credibility-based
    factual findings.  Similarly, the
    determination of whether any of the exceptions to return under the Hague
    Convention are made out in this case requires fact-based inquiries and
    findings.  Finally, the child herself
    must have a voice and an opportunity to participate at the new Hague Convention
    hearing.  We therefore conclude that this
    is the type of exceptional case in which the record must be supplemented by <i>viva voce</i> evidence.  </span></p>

    that his s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights were
    breached when the mother obtained a return date for the Hearing prior to the
    expiry of the 60-day period allowed under the <i>Rules</i> for a response to the Hague application.  We have already concluded that a new Hague
    Convention hearing must be ordered.  It
    is therefore unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal to address this

    application has a potentially life-altering affect on all interested parties,
    including, of course, on the parents of a child whose return is sought.  It is therefore axiomatic that the courts
    must be vigilant in ensuring procedural fairness for all concerned.  The <i>Rules</i> provide important safeguards in this respect, including provisions for proper
    notice of a Hague Convention application and the permissible time period for a
    response to such an application.  Judges
    must therefore be vigilant in ensuring that the protective purposes of the <i>Rules</i> are not disregarded or

    expeditious procedures available.</p>
  <p><i>Article 3</i></p>
  <p>The removal or the retention of

  <p>(a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a
    person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the

    would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.</p>
  <p>The rights of custody mentioned
    in sub-paragraph (a) above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by
    reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement
    having legal effect under the law of

  <p><i>Article 4</i></p>
  <p>The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in
