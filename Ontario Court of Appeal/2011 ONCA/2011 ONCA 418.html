  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From
    1997 to 1999, the respondent, Consulate Ventures Inc. (Consulate), through its
    principal Mr. John Sorokolit, worked with the appellants, Amico Contracting
    &amp; Engineering (1992) Inc. (Amico) and Windsor Factory Outlet Mall Ltd.
    (Outlet) on a project that saw 22 acres of raw land on the outskirts of
    Windsor, Ontario developed into a thriving manufacturers’ outlet mall. For much
    of that two-year period, through his dealings with the appellants’ principal, Mr.
    Dominic Amicone, Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit believed that Consulate and the appellants were
    working together as partners in a joint venture.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    that end, Mr. Sorokolit took an active role in the project. He was in the
    business of developing shopping malls and the appellants sought him out to help
    them develop the 22 acre parcel which they had purchased in 1995 and been
    unable to sell or lease. Mr. Sorokolit conceived of the idea of an American-style
    manufacturers’ outlet mall and became heavily involved in the planning, design,
    and naming of the mall. He was also active in leasing the project and played a
    large part in securing the initial key tenants who were essential to the mall’s
    development and its eventual success.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately
    for Consulate, on the day before Phase I of the mall was to open, the
    appellants for the first time took the position that they did not have a
    binding joint venture agreement with Consulate.  Their position in this regard was upheld in
    the litigation that followed, both at trial and on appeal to this court: see <i>Consulate Ventures Inc. v. Amico Contracting
    and Engineering (1992) Inc</i>. (2007), 282 D.L.R. (4th) 697.  Consulate’s alternative claim for
    restitutionary relief based on a <i>quantum
    meruit</i> claim was also rejected at trial. However, on the original appeal,
    this court determined that Consulate was entitled to such relief – but because
    it could not quantify the damages or determine whether, in addition to Outlet, the
    defendants Amico and/or Dominic Amicone were liable for them, a new trial was
    ordered on those issues. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    the new trial, Newbould J. valued Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim at $2.25 million. He also found Amico to be
    jointly and severally liable with Outlet. He dismissed the claim against
    Dominic Amicone.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Did
    the trial judge impermissibly use a “value added” approach rather than a “value
    received” approach in quantifying Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim;</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Assuming
    the trial judge did not use the wrong approach in valuing Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim, was he entitled to

    summarized the salient facts giving rise to Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim. They are found at paras. 3 to 8 of his
    decision as follows:<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In 1995,
    twenty-two acres of land zoned highway commercial in Windsor Ontario were
    purchased from CIBC under power of sale for $1 million (approximately $45,000
    per acre). The land was put in the name of Heritage Centre Holdings Inc.
    (“Heritage”), a nominee corporation of the shareholders, who intended to ‘flip’
    the property to a third party for the development of retail facilities.&nbsp;
    However, despite its efforts during the next two years, Heritage was unable to
    sell or lease the property. Heritage is now the defendant Windsor Factory
    Outlet Mall Ltd. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Consulate
    is an experienced shopping plaza developer, and was introduced to the property
    by a Heritage representative in the summer of 1996 who visited Consulate’s
    president, John Sorokolit, in Niagara Falls to try to interest him in
    developing the property.&nbsp; At that time, Consulate owned forty acres of
    land in Niagara Falls, Ontario which it was proposing to develop as an outlet
    mall facility.&nbsp; It was also involved in preliminary plans for a golf
    resort in Niagara Falls.&nbsp; At that time Mr. Sorokolit declined to become
    involved with the Windsor site.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Manufacturers’
    outlet malls were a relatively new concept in Canada in 1996. Mr. Sorokolit had
    made it his business to learn about the development of manufacturers’ outlet
    malls by attending many conferences and outlet mall sites in the United States,
    and he had some experience with leasing an outlet mall in Cookstown, Ontario. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Discussions
    again took place in the summer of 1997 and in September 1997, Consulate and
    Heritage signed a letter agreement containing terms of a proposed 50/50 joint
    venture of the Windsor property to develop a manufacturers’ outlet mall on the
    property. One month later in October 1997, after Heritage received a report
    from a third party that caused it to question the suitability of the property
    for an outlet mall, Heritage agreed to sell the property to a Consulate-related
    company for $2.5 million (approximately $110,000 per acre) under an agreement
    which gave Consulate a three month due diligence period, later extended to
    February 22, 1998, to satisfy itself that an acceptable tenancy level could be
    achieved for the proposed outlet mall.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Consulate
    did not proceed with its purchase. The evidence as to what then occurred and
    why differed between the parties. What is agreed is that a letter agreement
    dated June 16, 1998 and signed on November 14, 1998 was entered into which
    contemplated a 50/50 joint venture between Consulate and Heritage or its
    nominee Amico regarding the Windsor property and the Niagara Falls property of
    Consulate and the Niagara Falls golf club property being developed by
    Consulate. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Work on
    the outlet mall in Windsor proceeded. The extent of the efforts of Mr.
    Sorokolit on behalf of Consulate is an issue in this action, and highly
    contested. On June 23, 1999, one day before the opening of Phase 1, Heritage
    took the position that the letter agreement of June 16, 1998 was not a binding
    agreement. Litigation followed. It is this letter agreement that was held not
    to constitute a binding joint venture agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    mentioned, in the litigation that followed, Consulate sought damages for breach
    of contract and alternatively, restitutionary relief based on <i>quantum meruit</i>. The trial judge
    dismissed Consulate’s claim in its entirety. She rejected Consulate’s claim in
    contract because she found that Consulate had not entered into a formal joint
    venture agreement with the appellants. As for Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim, she concluded that it was dependent in law on
    a contractual relationship between the parties and since no such relationship
    existed, it could not succeed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    appeal from that decision, this court, per Cronk J.A., rejected the proposition
    that a <i>quantum meruit</i> claim is
    dependent on the existence of a valid contract. At para. 99 of her reasons, she
    set out the proper legal test:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, where the claim for restitutionary relief is
    based on <i>quantum meruit</i>, as in this case, an explicit mutual agreement
    to compensate for services rendered is not a prerequisite to recovery. It
    suffices if the services in question were furnished at the request, or with the
    encouragement or acquiescence, of the opposing party in circumstances that
    render it unjust for the opposing party to retain the benefit conferred by the
    provision of the services.&nbsp; <a name=reflex-caselaw-54349402></a>[Citations
    omitted.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having
    identified the correct legal test, Cronk J.A. reviewed the record and concluded
    at para. 101 that “there was considerable evidence at trial that Consulate’s
    services concerning the Windsor outlet mall were provided either at the request
    of, or with the encouragement or acquiescence of, Heritage and Amicone, in
    anticipation or in light of the arrangements reflected in the June Letter”. She
    then identified at para. 102 some of the services furnished by Consulate, that had
    advanced the development of the Windsor Property:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The services furnished by Consulate, without
    compensation, included:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the provision to Heritage,
    at Amicone’s request, of the business name “Windsor Crossing Premium Outlets”,
    which was adopted and used by Heritage;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the supply to
    Heritage of draft signage drawings for the Windsor outlet mall;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) &nbsp;&nbsp; the provision of advice,
    photographs and other documents regarding the design of the Windsor outlet
    mall;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; advice, at Amicone's
    express request, concerning the draft site plan, blueprints and construction specifications
    for the Windsor outlet mall;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; detailed information and
    advice, again at Amicone’s express request, on the contents and production of a
    leasing brochure;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; the provision of a leasing
    plan and precedent marketing plans;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vii) &nbsp;&nbsp; extensive efforts to secure
    suitable tenants for the Windsor outlet mall, including introductions to and
    discussions with Escada, Holt Renfrew, Adidas, Nike and others, ultimately
    resulting in letters of intent or completed leasing agreements with, at least,
    Escada, Adidas and Nike;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(viii) &nbsp; advice, also at Amicone’s request, regarding
    the terms of the proposed leasing agreement with Nike; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ix) &nbsp;&nbsp; to the knowledge of Amicone, the
    hiring of a leasing consultant, at Consulate’s sole expense, to secure tenant
    commitments.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the face of that evidence and additional evidence which showed that the
    appellants had either requested the services or encouraged or acquiesced in
    them, Cronk&nbsp;J.A. concluded at para. 109 that “a new trial is required to
    determine the nature, extent and value of the services provided by Consulate
    concerning the Windsor Property”.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    trial, the appellants concentrated on trying to downplay Mr. Sorokolit’s skills
    and abilities as a shopping mall developer and on minimizing the nature and
    value of the services he provided to the Windsor project. As the trial judge
    observed at para. 8 of his reasons, set out in full above at para. 6:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The

    resolution of “the extent of the efforts of Mr. Sorokolit on behalf of
    Consulate” accounts for almost 30 pages of the trial judge’s 54-page judgment.

    valuation and 3 pages on the issue of Amico’s liability on the <i>quantum meruit</i> claim. </span></p>

    the trial judge spent a considerable amount of time crafting his reasons for
    judgment. They are comprehensive and address in considerable detail the issues
    and arguments raised by the appellants at trial. As indicated, those issues and
    arguments related in the main to factual disputes concerning Mr. Sorokolit’s
    skills and abilities and the nature and extent of his contributions to the
    project.  The trial judge resolved those
    issues almost entirely in favour of Consulate. </span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s findings as to Mr. Sorokolit’s
    contributions</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge made strong findings of fact regarding the nature, extent and
    significance of Mr. Sorokolit’s contributions to the development of the property.
    He began by noting that prior to Mr. Sorokolit’s involvement, the 22 acre
    parcel of land belonging to the appellants had been lying dormant for two years.
    Their plan to purchase it and “flip it” had not panned out and the appellants were
    unable to sell or lease the property.  Moreover,
    the appellants had no experience in outlet malls and unlike Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit,
    “had not made it [their] business to learn anything about them”. Added to this,
    the appellants had limited commercial development experience. It was in this
    context that the trial judge explained what the appellants gained when they
    “sought out Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit to see if he was interested in developing an
    outlet mall”:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What Mr. Sorokolit brought to the table for the
    Windsor mall is an indication of his unique experience and expertise. It was
    instrumental in my view in the development proceeding as it did. It was also
    unique in the sense that Mr. Amicone or his employees did not possess the
    expertise that Mr. Sorokolit had and they had not brought anyone else on board
    who had that expertise. That is not surprising given the lack of persons in
    Canada experienced at the time in the outlet mall business. [para. 117.]</p>

    he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It cannot be overlooked however that once the
    initial key tenants were signed up, <i>in

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also considered it significant that for
    much of the two-year period during which Mr. Sorokolit worked on the project,
    he did so under the belief that Consulate and the appellants were working
    together as partners in a joint venture. That was the context within which Mr.
    Sorokolit’s contributions to the project were to be measured and the trial
    judge placed considerable emphasis on this in assessing the value of
    Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim. As
    the trial judge observed at para. 149 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have some difficulty with the theory of the
    defence on the market value of what Mr. Sorokolit provided.&nbsp; He was
    generally not requested by Mr. Amicone to do individual items of work.&nbsp;
    Rather ... he provided his services with the acquiescence or encouragement of
    Mr. Amicone in anticipation or in light of the joint venture arrangements
    contained in the June 16, 1998 letter.&nbsp; These arrangements were discussed
    between Mr. Sorokolit and Mr. Amicone far in advance of that letter, going back
    to November 1997.</p>

    aspects of shopping centre development, whether it be leasing, management,

    putting the plan in place, which he understood Mr. Sorokolit was responsible

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    for the valuation of Mr. Sorokolit’s services, when he prepared his report for
    the <i>quantum meruit</i> proceeding, Mr.
    Moore was aware that some years after the appellants had developed the project,
    they had sold the mall and made a profit of $27 million. Mr. Moore referred to
    this gain as the “enhanced value of the project”. He stated that had it been up
    to him, he would have fixed the fair market value of the services provided by
    Consulate at 25 percent of that value or $6.75 million. However, because he was
    asked to value the services provided by Consulate without regard to the
    enhanced value of the project, it was his view that Consulate should receive a
    fee that was commensurate with the unique expertise and experience it had
    brought to the project. With that in mind, he concluded that a fee in the range
    of $20 per sq. ft. would be appropriate. The mall consisted of 248,000 sq. ft.  However, making allowances for vacancies, he concluded
    that Consulate should be paid $20 per sq. ft. for 225,000 sq. ft. or $4.5
    million. </span></p>

    Moore did not provide any breakdown as to how he arrived at his value of $20
    per sq. ft. figure and neither Consulate’s counsel nor counsel for the
    defendants asked him about that figure. Accordingly, the trial judge posed several
    questions to Mr. Moore at the conclusion of his testimony. Mr. Moore’s
    responses are summarized at para. 125 of the trial judge’s reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In answer to questions from me at the end of his
    evidence, Mr. Moore said that based on his experience, a market rate paid for
    pre-development work and leasing of a conventional shopping centre, in which a
    developer already had the development plans for it, would generally be $8 to $9
    per sq. ft. If only leasing work was being done, the rate would be $6 to $7 per
    sq. ft. He said that in this case, because of the uniqueness of the project in
    Canada, the fact that Windsor did not need any more conventional shopping
    centres and the fact that Consulate had provided the key to its development as
    an outlet mall, Consulate would be entitled to an additional fee which took it
    up to $20 per sq. ft. </p>

lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    pause here to note that Outlet’s factum contains a submission that it was
    improper for the trial judge to elicit the “breakdown” evidence and in doing
    so, he impermissibly “descended into the arena” and “created an impression of
    unfairness to the defence”. In oral argument, however, Outlet did not press
    this complaint – and properly so, in my view. In posing the questions he did,
    the trial judge was merely seeking clarification of evidence that was already
    before him. He was not delving into a new area; nor was he filling in a gap for
    Consulate’s benefit. </span></p>

    Mr. Amicone’s evidence and accepted Mr. Sorokolit’s evidence as to the meaning
    and intent of the clause, namely: Consulate would be paid a $2 million break
    fee for the work it had performed on the project up to December 31, 1997 should

    most important part of the development was the initial period because the
    concept, site plan, design, target tenants and the initial key tenant
    introductions <i>were fundamental to the
    development of the mall. His value of $20 per square foot was not a value based

    accepted Mr. Moore’s approach to valuation as the “preferable approach”, the
    trial judge was not prepared to blindly accept the $20 per sq. ft. figure that
    Mr. Moore used in calculating the fair market value of Mr. Sorokolit’s services.
    In a word, the trial judge considered the $20 figure to be excessive. He
    provided four reasons for this:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    later phases of the mall”.</span></p>

    was an overstatement to say that Mr. Sorokolit’s recommendations regarding the

    arriving at the figure of $20 per sq. ft., Mr. Moore included an amount of $11
    or so per sq. ft. for the “uniqueness of the development”. In Mr. Moore’s view,
    uniqueness was “the key to the development” and that is what “Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit
    provided”. The $11 figure, however, involved a degree of speculation as to the
    amount that “would be paid in the marketplace for this unique concept” given
    that Canada at the time had “little or no experience” with manufacturers’

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Moore’s $8 to $9 rate was derived from $2 for

    balance of $11 for the uniqueness involved in what Mr. Sorokolit provided. I
    would allow $4 for that. The total is thus $10 per sq. ft. that I would apply
    to 225,000 sq. ft. to get $2.25 million. That is the amount that I find
    represents the market value of what one would pay for all of the services and
    materials provided by Mr. Sorokolit. I fix $2.25 million as the amount to be
    paid to Consulate for its <i>quantum meruit</i> claim.</p>

    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. Mr. Moore was keenly aware of
    the different approaches to valuation. At Consulate’s instance, he performed a
    valuation that reflected the market value of Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit’s contributions
    to the project, bearing in mind his “unique expertise and experience”. That is
    a “value received” approach and Mr.&nbsp;Moore clearly understood the
    difference between it and a “value added” approach.  As Mr. Moore explained in his testimony, had
    he applied the latter approach, he would have valued Mr. Sorokolit’s services

    approach and the “value received” approach. At para. 12-18 of his reasons, he
    set out the principles that govern a <i>quantum
    meruit</i> award for services provided. In particular, at para. 15, he quoted
    the following passage from P. D. Maddaugh and J. D. McCamus, <i>The Law of Restitution</i>, vol. 1,

    as to the various possible measures of relief available in a <i>quantum meruit</i> claim):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although
    the measure of relief in these claims, generally speaking, is the reasonable
    value of the benefit conferred in each case, it must be noted that this measure
    may vary from one context to the next. There are a number of possible measures,
    including the cost to the claimant of providing the benefit, the <i>market value of the benefit bestowed</i>,
    or, alternatively, the value placed on the benefit by the recipient, where this
    differs from either of the other two measures. Further, where the benefit has
    been conferred under an ineffective agreement, it may be asked whether the
    quantum of relief should be limited by the value ascribed to it by the contract
    price. <i>As will be seen, the
    appropriateness of a particular measure will depend on the circumstances in
    which it is applied and it is, therefore, undesirable to articulate a general
    principle favouring the utilization of any one of these measures either
    presumptively or as a general rule</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    my view, the argument put forward by the appellants rests essentially on the
    notion that there is only one way to remain faithful to the “value received”
    approach when calculating the fair market value of services like those provided
    by Mr. Sorokolit. That approach is a mechanical one in which the services are
    costed out on a piecemeal basis having regard to prevailing market rates and
    practices. The appellants do not accept as legitimate the more nuanced
    contextual approach advocated by Mr. Moore. Under that approach, the services
    in question are considered in the context of the facts and circumstances under
    which they are provided and valued accordingly. </span></p>

    restitutionary relief.  As McLachlin J.

    trial judge in the instant case sought to place a fair and equitable value on
    the services provided by Mr. Sorokolit. In doing so, he preferred the evidence
    of Mr. Moore over that of the appellants’ experts, including the approach Mr.
    Moore chose in valuing Mr. Sorokolit’s services. That approach recognized the
    particular circumstances under which Mr. Sorokolit provided the services, the
    unique features of those services and the special expertise that Mr. Sorokolit
    brought to the table. To be sure, this was not a case of valuing Mr.
    Sorokolit’s services as though he were providing standard services readily
    available in the marketplace from a host of people, and the trial judge refused
    to treat it as such. </span></p>

    appellants approached Mr. Sorokolit initially because of his experience and
    knowledge as a developer of shopping malls. At the time, they had been sitting
    on a piece of raw land for two years.  Their plan to “flip” it had gone awry and they could not sell or lease
    the property. In short, they needed help. And they found it in the person of
    Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit. In this regard, it is worth repeating the trial judge’s
    observations at para. 117 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What Mr. Sorokolit brought to the table for the
    Windsor mall is an indication of his unique experience and expertise. It was
    instrumental in my view in the development proceeding as it did. It was also unique
    in the sense that Mr. Amicone or his employees did not possess the expertise
    that Mr. Sorokolit had and they had not brought anyone else on board who had
    that expertise. That is not surprising given the lack of persons in Canada
    experienced at the time in the outlet mall business.</p>

    most of the two-year period in which Mr. Sorokolit worked on the project, he
    did so under the honest but mistaken belief that Consulate was working with the
    appellants as joint venture partners. As such, he did not view his services as
    piecemeal in nature, nor was he docketing his time or quoting prices for particular
    services rendered. Rather, he was acting as a co-venturer whose primary goal
    was to turn a dormant piece of raw land into a successful manufacturers’ outlet
    mall. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    that end, Mr. Sorokolit worked hard during the initial stages of the
    development. Mr.&nbsp;Moore described the initial period as “the most important
    part of the development because the concept, site plan, design, target tenants
    and the initial key tenant introductions were fundamental to the development of
    the mall”. The trial judge accepted Mr. Moore’s assessment.</span></p>

    be artificial and not in keeping with the fundamental role he played in developing
    the project.</span></p>

    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in giving any credence or weight
    to the $20 per sq. ft. figure that Mr. Moore used in calculating the fair
    market value of Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit’s contributions to the project. The argument
    of the appellants, in its simplest form, is that Mr. Moore effectively pulled
    that figure and its component parts - $8-$9 per sq. ft. for pre-development and
    leasing, and $11 per sq. ft. for providing the “fundamental blueprint for the
    development” – out of the air. And he did so to camouflage what in reality was
    a “value added” approach to the calculation of Consulate’s damages.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Proof
    of this, the appellants maintain, is evident in Mr. Moore’s own evidence. He
    provided no examples or comparatives in arriving at the $20 figure and he
    conceded that he had never purchased services like those provided by Mr.
    Sorokolit.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately
    for the appellants, the trial judge saw the matter differently. Mr.&nbsp;Moore
    had been involved “in the development of shopping centres, including leasing
    and related financial matters, and in the quantification of the value of
    development services” for over 30 years and he had extensive experience “from
    the seller’s side of the market”.  In the
    trial judge’s opinion, the breadth and extent of Mr. Moore’s experience enabled
    him to give opinion evidence as to the fee a purchaser would pay in the open
    market to obtain the type of services Mr. Sorokolit was able to, and did
    provide to the appellants.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    for the $20 per sq. ft. figure, Mr. Moore stated that from his experience, “a
    market rate paid for pre-development work and leasing of a conventional
    shopping centre, <i>in which a developer
    already had the development plans for it</i>, would generally be $8-$9 per sq.
    ft.” (emphasis added). The appellants did not lead evidence challenging that
    figure and the trial judge was entitled to act on it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Notably,
    as Mr. Moore explained, the $8-$9 per sq. ft. figure applied in cases where
    “the developer already had the development plans”. That was not this case.
    Here, the project was unique in Canada; the City of Windsor did not need any
    more conventional shopping centres and Consulate provided “the key” to the
    “development [of the property] as an outlet mall”. In Mr. Moore’s opinion, those
    features served to take the case out of the ordinary and “entitled [Consulate]
    to an additional fee which took it up to $20 per sq. ft.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    Mr. Moore cannot be faulted for failing to provide comparables from the
    Canadian marketplace. As he observed, manufacturers’ outlet malls were
    virtually unheard of in Canada at the time. Moreover, as he noted, in deals of
    this nature, the normal situation would be for a company like Consulate to take
    an equity position in the project and put up some financing. That did not occur
    here, although Consulate viewed the situation as though it was engaged in a
    joint venture with the appellants. The trial judge was mindful of this in
    approaching the issue of damages.  He
    recognized that in assessing damages on a <i>quantum
    meruit</i> basis, he was not bound by a single measure of relief. Rather, he
    was entitled to consider various measures of relief with a view to arriving at
    a fair and just award.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the trial judge was keenly aware that Mr. Moore’s opinion as to the extra $11
    per sq. ft. for “uniqueness” was just that – an opinion – and that it
    necessarily involved a certain amount of “speculation” or “intelligent guesswork”
    because there were few if any precedents as to “what would be paid in the [Canadian]
    marketplace for this unique concept… at that time”. That said, the trial judge recognized
    that Mr. Moore’s “opinion” was not just the opinion of anyone. It was the
    opinion of “an experienced and knowledgeable consultant in the development
    business as to what someone would have to pay for Mr. Sorokolit’s services”.
    Hence, it was not to be “completely disregarded”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    indicated, I am satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to treat Mr.
    Moore’s evidence as credible and probative and give it the weight he felt it
    deserved. Accordingly, I would not give effect to this aspect of the appellants’
    argument.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue Three: Did the trial
    judge err in failing to limit Consulate’s damages to reflect the actual
    services provided by Consulate?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge overcompensated Consulate for the
    services Mr. Sorokolit actually provided. In this regard, they point to the
    fact that Mr.&nbsp;Sorokolit’s involvement with the project ended in June 1999
    at the end of the project’s first phase. That phase consisted of only 52,900
    sq. ft. Hence, an award based on 225,000 sq. ft. (the entire rentable space in
    the mall), was unwarranted and provided Consulate with a windfall. Likewise, in
    awarding Consulate $900,000 ($4 per sq. ft. x 225,000 sq.&nbsp;ft.) for leasing
    compensation, the trial judge grossly over-compensated Consulate bearing in
    mind the actual work performed by Mr. Sorokolit and the success he had in
    securing tenants for the mall. The appellants point to the fact that by June 23,
    1999, when he was terminated, Mr. Sorokolit had only secured one tenant, Adidas.
    He had also introduced Nike to the project but it was the appellants who
    secured the Nike lease.  Finally, the
    appellants point to a letter, dated February 1, 1999, in which Consulate
    indicated that it would “fulfill [its] obligation to the joint venture by
    taking on the leasing responsibilities <i>exclusively</i> at a rate of Three Dollars [$3.00] per sq. ft.” (emphasis in original). As
    well, the leasing commission was to be paid in installments. No payment was to
    be made for simply introducing a tenant to the development.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would not give effect to these arguments. In my view, they are largely a
    throwback to the appellant’s main contention that the trial judge should have
    used a mechanical approach as opposed to a contextual approach in assessing the
    fair market value of Mr. Sorokolit’s contributions and the services he provided.
    I have already explained why I reject that submission and see no need to repeat
    it. As for Consulate’s commitments in the February 1, 1999 letter, they were
    made in contemplation of a joint venture undertaking that did not materialize.
    Hence, in my view, they carry no more weight than the $2 million “break fee” which
    the parties had negotiated.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    short, the trial judge was entitled to use the approach advocated by Mr. Moore
    in assessing Consulate’s damages. Notably, however, he did not blindly accept
    Mr.&nbsp;Moore’s figures. Indeed, he cut the fee per sq. ft. suggested by Mr.
    Moore in half, from $20 to $10, in arriving at the $2.25 million award which he
    felt was fair and just. In doing so, he recognized that Mr. Sorokolit was “not
    involved through to the completion of the mall and in the leasing efforts that
    continued for the later phases of the mall”. He also recognized that the fee
    attributable to “uniqueness” was very much a matter of opinion, albeit an
    opinion of an experienced and knowledgeable consultant. As such, he was not
    prepared to “completely disregard” it. However, in the end, he chose discount
    it by approximately 60 percent from the $11 per sq. ft. suggested by Mr. Moore to
    $4 per sq. ft.</span></p>

    reducing the fee per sq. ft. for leasing services and uniqueness, the trial
    judge was not merely picking numbers out of the air, as the appellants suggest.
    Rather, he was adjusting Mr. Moore’s numbers to arrive at an award that he believed
    was fair and just in the circumstances. In short, he was performing the role
    expected of him as a trial judge. </span></p>

    the end, the trial judge was satisfied that Outlet and Amico were acting hand-in-hand
    as co-venturers in the project. On the trial judge’s analysis, amply supported
    by the evidence, it would be totally artificial to regard Amico and Heritage as
    entirely separate entities for purposes of the development. They were fingers
    of the same hand and both stood to gain and did gain directly from the
    successful development of the property.</span></p>

    and the issue of damages. In the circumstances, with the concurrence of the
    appellants, Consulate is entitled to its costs of the appeal in the amount of
    $30,000 inclusive of disbursements and H.S.T.</span></p>
