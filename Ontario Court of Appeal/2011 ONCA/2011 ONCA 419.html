  <h2>I.         OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    Province of Ontario completed a new four-lane section of Highway 417 near the
    Hamlet of Antrim, close to Ottawa. The reason for this undertaking was public
    safety.  The new highway rerouted traffic
    away from Highway 17, the use of which had exceeded its design capacity.  This over-use was causing so many accidents
    that the particular portion of Highway 17 in issue had acquired the name,
    &quot;the killer highway&quot;.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>This appeal involves
    the effect of the new Highway 417 on a truck stop, owned by the respondent,
    Antrim Truck Centre Ltd., which was, at the time the new portion of Highway 417
    was built, located on the affected part of Highway 17. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>Antrim took the
    position that the undertaking severely impeded the road access to the truck
    stop and therefore substantially interfered with its use and enjoyment of its
    property.  As a result, Antrim applied to
    the Ontario Municipal Board (the “OMB”) for a determination of the compensation
    to which it was entitled from the appellant, Her Majesty the Queen in right of
    Ontario, as represented by the Minister of Transportation (the
    &quot;MTO&quot;), for injurious affection under the <i>Expropriations Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26. Antrim claimed
    compensation of $8,224,671 for “business damages” including the costs it
    incurred in relocating the truck stop to nearby Arnprior shortly after the new
    Highway 417 opened.  <i></i></span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>The OMB, in its order
    of January 9, 2009, awarded Antrim damages of $393,000<i> </i>for injurious affection. <i></i></span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    order to the Divisional Court and Antrim cross-appealed the amount of the
    award. The decision was affirmed on appeal: (2010), 100 O.R. (3d) 425.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>On its appeal from the
    decision of the Divisional Court, with<i> </i>the
    leave of this<i> </i>court, the MTO advances
    two main arguments.  First, it submits
    that the Divisional Court erred in upholding the OMB's finding that Antrim had
    made out the tort of nuisance, a necessary element of its claim based on injurious
    affection.  Second, the MTO contends that
    the Divisional Court erred in upholding the OMB’s finding that the interference
    with the Antrim land was the result of the construction of Highway 417 rather
    than its use, also a necessary element of its claim.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>In its cross-appeal,
    Antrim contends that restitution principles should apply to allow it to recover
    its construction and relocation costs as business damages under s. 1(1)(b) of
    the <i>Expropriations Act.</i>  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>For the reasons that
    follow, I would allow the appeal.  While
    it is not necessary to consider the cross-appeal in these circumstances, I
    would dismiss the cross-appeal.  </span></p>
  <h2>II.        THE
    FACTS </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>The facts are not in
    dispute. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>In 1978, Mr. and Ms.
    Cameron, as shareholders of Antrim, purchased the truck stop property from Ms.
    Cameron's mother.  In the first few
    years, the Camerons lived in a trailer on the property and operated a small gas
    bar, restaurant and store frequented by truck drivers.  Over the years, the Camerons’ hard work paid
    off.  By the time Highway 417 opened, the
    business had become highly successful and included a restaurant, bakery, gift
    shop, gas bar, offices, truck sales, leasing and service centre and diesel fuel
    bar.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>In 2003, its final
    full year of operation at the original location, the business generated gross
    revenue of over $15,000,000 and employed more than 100 people.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>In 1978, when the
    Camerons acquired the property, they knew that the MTO was considering the
    construction of a new highway, the exact location of which had not been
    finalized.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>The MTO was sensitive
    to the impact a change in the highway configuration might have on Antrim’s
    business. During the planning phase of the new highway, MTO officials discussed
    with the Camerons proposals for the alignment of the new road. The minutes of
    these meetings demonstrate that while the Camerons understood that a change was
    necessary, they were concerned about the survival of their business and what
    compensation might be available to them for any loss they suffered as a result
    of the new highway. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>Ultimately, the MTO
    adopted a plan to construct the new highway approximately 500 metres to the
    south of the Antrim property.  For six
    weeks during the construction process, Highway 17 was blocked east of Antrim’s
    property, but access to the property remained available via Regional Road 20,
    the route currently used to access the Antrim site from Highway 417.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>In September 2004, the
    MTO completed and opened the new section of Highway 417. Highway 17 was merged
    with Grant’s Side Road one and a half kilometres to the east.  Attached to these reasons and marked as
    Schedule A, is a map showing the town of Antrim, the Antrim site and Highway
    417 together with the driving distances between Highway 417 and the Antrim site
    for motorists travelling either east or west on the highway.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>As can be seen from this
    map, the construction of the new highway and the merger of Highway 17 and
    Grant’s Side Road affected the access to the Antrim property.  Traffic travelling either east or west on
    Highway 417 can now access the site by turning off onto Regional Road 20 and
    from there onto Highway 17.  Once on
    Highway 17, the property is accessible as before.  Whereas the property was previously located right
    on the highway, motorists travelling on Highway 417 must now drive
    approximately two kilometres to reach the truck stop.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>Several years prior to
    the construction of the new highway, the Camerons began to acquire property in
    the Arnprior area, approximately 15 kilometres from the Antrim site. Six weeks
    after the new highway opened, they moved their business to Arnprior, a move
    that turned out to be financially beneficial.   </span></p>
  <h2>III.      THE LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    conditions in which the government of Ontario may expropriate land, the
    circumstances in which compensation will be available to the owners of land
    that is expropriated or injuriously affected by government actions and the
    nature of the compensation that will be available. As explained by Cory J. in <i>Toronto Area Transit Authority v. Dell
    Holdings Ltd</i>., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 32, at para 19, the Act “is clearly a
    remedial statute enacted for the specific purpose of adequately compensating

    based on “injurious affection” where the statutory authority (the MTO) does not
    acquire part of the claimant’s land.  Section 1 of the <i>Expropriations
    Act</i> sets out the basis of the compensation available under a claim of this
    nature:</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>“injurious affection” means,</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a) where a statutory

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)   the reduction in

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)  such personal and
    business damages, resulting from the construction or use, or both, of the works

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b) where the

    such reduction in the market value of the land of the owner, and</span></p>

    such personal and business damages,</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>resulting from the construction and not the use of the works

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, s. 21 of the Act provides that an

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>All highway construction will
    cause disruption. Sometimes it will damage property, sometimes it will enhance
    its value. To fix the Minister with liability for damages to every landowner
    whose property interest is damaged, by reason only of the construction of a
    highway on neighbouring lands, would place an intolerable burden on the public
    purse. Highways are necessary: they cause disruption. In the balancing process
    inherent in the law of nuisance, their utility for the public good far
    outweighs the disruption and injury which is visited upon some adjoining lands.

    other disputed issue, whether the interference with the access to Antrim’s
    property was caused by the construction rather than the use of the new highway
    as required under s. 1(1)(b) of the Act, the OMB relied on the articulation of
    the test found in George S. Challies, <i>The
    Law of Expropriation</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Montreal: Wilson &amp; Lafleur,
    Limited, 1963), at p. 138, as adopted in <i>Re

    damages, the board noted that in this case, where no land was taken, compensation
    under the <i>Expropriations Act</i> was
    limited to the reduction in the market value of the Antrim property and
    personal and business damages. Accordingly, based on <i>Dell Holdings</i> and ss. 18 and 19 of the <i>Expropriations Act</i>, which exclude disturbance damages and
    relocation costs from the compensation available for injurious affection,<i> </i>Antrim’s principal claim based on the
    costs of the move to the Arnprior location could not succeed. Relying on the
    expert evidence provided by the MTO, the board concluded that Antrim had
    established a business loss of $58,000 and a loss in the market value of the
    affected property of $335,000, giving rise to total damages of $393,000.</span></p>

    identified the definition of and test for nuisance as a question of law that
    should be reviewed on a standard of correctness. The court saw the application
    of the law of nuisance as a question of mixed fact and law that engages the
    board’s expertise and therefore held it to be reviewable on a standard of
    reasonableness.</span></p>

    specifically focused on the parties’ dispute over whether the examination of
    Antrim’s claim in nuisance required the board to balance the public interest
    against Antrim’s individual interest.  On
    that issue, the court held that this was a question of law outside of the
    expertise of the OMB and that therefore the appropriate standard of review was
    correctness.  However, the actual
    exercise of balancing these competing interests was found to squarely engage
    the expertise of the board and therefore the standard of reasonableness applied. </span></p>

    Court recognized the interpretation of the “construction not the use” test as a
    question of law, it identified the issue, codified in the <i>Expropriations Act</i>, as being unique to the law of injurious
    affection and therefore within the specialized expertise of the board.  Accordingly, the court concluded that both
    the definition and the application of this test should be reviewed on a
    standard of reasonableness.</span></p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A person, then, may be said to

    interference with access, short of complete obstruction, can amount to nuisance
    as long as the interference is “proximate and substantial”.  In expressing this view, the court relied on <i>R. v. Loiselle</i>, [1962] S.C.R. 624; <i>Larson</i>; <i>Jesperson’s Brake and Muffler Ltd. v. Chilliwack (District) </i>(1994),

    an appropriate weighing of the competing interests. It further held that the
    board’s findings were supported by the evidence.  As a result, the Divisional Court determined

  <h2>The “construction not the use” test</h2>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The clearest examples of “use” as distinguished from “construction”
    would appear to be highway noise, or noise emanating from the operation of an

    landfill site: <i>Barnside Sand &amp; Gravel
    Ltd. v. Ottawa-Carleton (Regional Municipality) </i>(2000), 71 L.C.R. 216

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The clearest example of a loss
    resulting from “construction” is business loss arising from interference with
    access during the construction of a public work. <i>Loiselle, supra </i>and the [<i>Larson</i>]
    case seem to lie somewhat in the middle, but given the tenor of judicial
    thinking, it seems evident that where the completed work interferes with access
    to an owner’s land he or she will be compensated for any loss which directly
    results from that interference.</span></p>

    the leading case as <i>Larson</i>, which
    articulates the test to be applied as “whether the works as constructed, if
    left unused, would interfere with the actual enjoyment of the property”. The
    court noted that, in this case, if Highway 417 were constructed but not used,
    traffic coming from the east would have to make a significant,
    three-directional detour to reach the truck stop. Observing that the OMB had
    the benefit of a site visit and that this issue engaged the board’s expertise,
    the court concluded that the OMB’s decision that the interference was the
    product of the construction of Highway 417, and particularly of the detour, was
    supported by the evidence and was reasonable.</span></p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>There is no effective privative clause applicable to the

    as of right to the Divisional Court “on questions of law or fact or both and
    the Divisional Court (a) may refer any matter back to the Board; or (b) may
    make any decision or order that the Board has power to make”. Thus, not only is
    there no privative clause but a very wide power of appeal is granted. Nor is
    there any aspect of particular expertise involved in this decision. I would
    agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that no particular deference
    should be accorded to a decision of the Board. That is to say the decision of
    the Board must be correct.</span></p>

    the standard of review applicable to all OMB decisions or all issues that could
    potentially be raised on an appeal under s. 31 of the <i>Expropriations Act</i>. I refer to the specific observation made by
    Cory J. in the excerpted paragraph to the effect that the issue being
    considered in <i>Dell Holdings</i> did not
    involve any particular expertise.  This sentence
    suggests that other issues considered by the board under the <i>Expropriations Act</i> that do engage the

    clear that the approach to the determination of the standard of review can vary
    significantly depending on, among other things, the issue being
    challenged.  One issue determined by a
    tribunal that a party seeks to have reviewed may attract a different standard
    of review than another issue, even where both have been decided by the same

    board’s identification of the definition of and test for nuisance. Within this
    issue is the contentious question of whether the nuisance test includes
    balancing the interests of the party whose activity is the subject of the
    complaint and the party whose land is allegedly affected by that activity.  I agree with what appears to be a consensus
    that correctness is the standard that applies to these issues.</span></p>

    application of the law of nuisance is reviewable on a standard of
    reasonableness.  Once the law of nuisance
    is properly identified, there is good reason to defer to the board’s
    determination of the facts and whether they satisfy the requirements of the legal
    test. The board is best positioned to appreciate the relevant facts and to apply
    those facts in deciding whether the interference with the claimant’s land is
    substantial and unreasonable. These are clearly questions of mixed fact and law
    that<i> </i>do not lend themselves to
    objectively correct and incorrect answers. I see no reason why they would be
    reviewed on a standard of correctness: see the recent decision of the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Susan Heyes
    Inc. v. Vancouver (City)</i> (2011), 15 B.C.L.R. (5<sup>th</sup>) 47, at para.

    the board failed to take into account all relevant evidence in determining the
    reasonableness of the MTO’s actions, most notably the board’s specific finding
    of fact that Antrim’s access to Highway 417 was typical of other truck
    stops.  It relies on this submission in
    support of its position that the Divisional Court should have reviewed the
    board’s application of the test for nuisance to the facts on a standard of
    correctness. Citing <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen, </i>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235,<i> </i>the MTO
    submits that where a decision-maker properly identifies the legal test but
    mis-applies the facts to the law, the decision-maker has committed an error of
    law, reviewable on a correctness standard.</span></p>

    required consideration of only A, B, and C.&nbsp; If the correct test requires
    him or her to consider D as well, then the decision-maker has in effect applied
    the wrong law, and so has made an error of law.</span></p>

    nature would attract review on a standard of correctness, this does not require
    that the board’s application of the law of nuisance to the facts of this case,
    in its entirety, be reviewed on a standard of correctness. However, the
    omission upon which the MTO relies does not assist its argument. As I will
    explain later, it cannot necessarily be said that the board made an error of
    this nature.  </span></p>

    which there is a dispute as to the standard of review, is the Divisional
    Court’s consideration of the board’s interpretation and application of the
    “construction not the use” test on a standard of reasonableness. The MTO
    contends that the proper standard of review is correctness, its argument being
    that this “hypothetical question is a question of law.”  </span></p>

    injurious affection. The “construction not the use” test is a key aspect of the
    injurious affection analysis.  The
    experience the board gains in working with a test that is specifically set out
    in the <i>Expropriations Act</i>, allows it
    to develop a particular expertise. This observation provides support for the
    Divisional Court’s conclusion that both the interpretation and application of
    the test are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. Furthermore, the
    application of the “construction not the use” test is a question of mixed fact
    and law, offering additional support for the Divisional Court’s conclusion that
    this issue should be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness.</span></p>

    by discussing its underlying rationale:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='color:black'>The assessment whether a given interference should be
    characterized as a nuisance turns on the question, simple to state but
    difficult to resolve, whether in the circumstances it is reasonable to deny
    compensation to the aggrieved party. The courts have traditionally approached
    this problem of reconciling conflicting uses of land with an eye to a standard
    based, in large part, on the formulations of Knight Bruce V.C. in <i>Walter v.
    Selfe</i></span><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'> (1851), 4 De G.

    S. 66, 122 E.R. 27</span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>,<span style='color:black'>  at pp. 83-84 and at pp. 32-33 respectively. There it was observed that
    the very existence of organised society depended on a generous application of
    the principle of “give and take, live and let live”. It was therefore
    appropriate to interpret as actionable nuisances only those inconveniences that
    materially interfere with ordinary comfort as defined according to the
    standards held by those of plain and sober tastes. In effect, the law would
    only intervene to shield persons from interferences to their enjoyment of
    property that were unreasonable in the light of all the circumstances.<br>

    this definition, the test for nuisance, at its core, commands a two-part
    analysis. Fleming (<i>The Law of Torts</i>,
    9<sup>th</sup> ed. (Sydney: The Law Book Company, 1998) puts it simply at p.
    466: “[T]o constitute a legal nuisance, the annoyance or discomfort must be <i>substantial</i> and <i>unreasonable</i>” (emphasis added): see also <i>St. Lawrence Cement v. Barrette</i>, at para. 77. Murphy, at p. 420,
    explains that these elements of the test should not be viewed as mutually
    exclusive and that an interference that is unreasonable will also often
    necessarily be substantial.</span></p>

    live in closer proximity to each other, a certain amount, arguably an
    ever-increasing amount, of interference with each other’s property must be
    tolerated.  It makes sense, therefore,
    that only substantial interference constitutes nuisance. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The requirement that the interference be
    substantial is a threshold aspect of the test. At this stage of the analysis,
    the court will exclude claims that disclose no actual interference as well as
    those in which the interference alleged is so trifling as to amount to no
    interference at all: Fleming, at p. 466; Linden &amp; Feldthusen, at p. 581;

    an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff's land
    is a question of judgment based on all of the circumstances. The focus is on
    the gravity of the harm caused and the utility of the defendant's conduct. As identified by the
    Divisional Court, this assessment is undertaken through the consideration of
    four factors:</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>the severity of the

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>the sensitivity of the
    plaintiff.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    severity of the interference, recognizes that the greater the impact of the
    interference, the more likely it will be characterized as unreasonable. As
    indicated by Murphy, at p. 420, there is significant overlap between this
    factor of the reasonableness analysis and the first part of the test for
    nuisance – whether the interference is substantial.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>The substance test and
    the severity factor ask essentially the same question – how serious is the harm
    caused by the interference – but do so for different purposes. In asking
    whether the interference is substantial, the court seeks to determine whether
    the actions of the defendant have caused any harm at all, and if so, whether it
    is sufficiently material to justify recognition, and possible intervention, by
    the courts. Where the interference is so trivial that it does not pass this
    stage of the test, there will be no need to consider whether the interference is
    unreasonable in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>The severity of the
    interference element of the reasonableness analysis again considers the
    significance of the harm caused by the interference in question. At this stage,
    however, the purpose of the inquiry is not to determine whether the
    interference alleged is of a sort that warrants the recognition of the courts
    (the threshold test), but rather whether the interference is sufficiently
    severe that, when viewed alongside the other elements of the reasonableness
    analysis, the plaintiff should not be expected to tolerate it in the
    circumstances. Murphy makes the point, at p. 420 that, in many cases, an
    interference that is unreasonable will also necessarily be substantial, raising
    a question as to the actual value of the substantial interference part of the
    test for nuisance. However, as the authorities indicate that to amount to
    nuisance the interference must be both substantial and unreasonable, in my
    view, distinct considerations of these elements are required.</span></p>

    second factor, the character of the neighbourhood, recognizes that what is reasonable
    must be viewed with reference to where the interference takes place and what is

    utility of the defendant's conduct, involves an examination of the importance
    of the defendant’s enterprise and its value to the community. Thus, a defendant

    considerable public value in the particular locality. </span></p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman";color:black'>It was never intended that where the execution
    of works, authorized by Acts of Parliament, sentimentally affected values in
    the neighbourhood, all such property owners could have a claim for damages. In
    most of our large cities values are continually changing by reason of necessary
    public improvements made, and if, although no lands are taken, everybody owning
    lands in the locality could, by reason of the changed character of the
    neighbourhood or interference with certain convenient highways, claim
    compensation by reason of a supposed falling of the previous market value of
    property in the neighbourhood, it would render practically impossible the

    given substantial weight. </i>An indication of the kind of weight which should
    be given to this factor where a highway is involved appears in the reasons for
    judgment delivered by McIntyre J. on behalf of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>St. Pierre v. Ontario (Minister of

    will be no actionable nuisance. A property owner cannot expose a neighbour to
    greater liability by adopting an unusual and especially sensitive use of his or
    her land: Murphy, at p. 428. The simple fact that a plaintiff is abnormally
    sensitive is not sufficient, however, to bar a claim in nuisance, as the claim
    may nevertheless succeed if the interference would have amounted to an
    actionable claim were the plaintiff a person with ordinary sensitivities:

    be gone through to determine whether the Minister’s conduct or use of land has
    been “unreasonable.” In both <i>Loiselle</i> and <i>Larson</i> there had been substantial
    or significant interference with access to the claimant’s land. That was held
    sufficient to constitute a nuisance. Mr. Justice McIntyre distinguished those

    where, at p. 916, McIntyre J. observes that the interferences in <i>Loiselle</i> and <i>Larson</i> were in close proximity to the land. I read this, however, merely
    as a description of the interference in question rather than as the expression

    road configuration, may be one such activity.  However, this does not mean that one who has suffered an interference
    with the use and enjoyment of his or her land should be barred from seeking
    compensation for that interference simply because its source is geographically

    Claimant’s property. Physical changes to Highway 17 were made. After the
    opening of Highway 417 on September 24, 2004, Highway 17 was closed east of the
    Claimant’s property until October 28, 2004. The purpose of this was to merge
    Highway 17 with Grants Side Road. Grants Side Road is a dirt road. The
    Respondent argues no change in a Highway running east/west joining a dirt road
    running north/south. While it is possible to travel some distance on the dirt
    road to intersect with Donald Munro and then Panmure Drive which intersects
    with Highway 417 at an interchange, it is indeed a stretch to assert no

    further mention of this aspect of the test for nuisance, aside from identifying
    it as an element to be considered in the balancing process it found to be part
    of that test.  Rather, in concluding that
    the OMB’s determination that nuisance had been made out was reasonable, the court
    focused almost exclusively on the board’s findings that the interference was
    substantial and met what the court described as the test of proximity. At para.

    the lands so changed their situation as to greatly reduce if not eliminate

    interference with access amounted to a “serious impairment in nuisance”, its
    analysis fell short in two respects. First, the board failed to consider two of
    the other three factors it was obliged to take into account in assessing the
    reasonableness of the interference: the character of the neighbourhood and any abnormal
    sensitivity of Antrim. Secondly, the board failed to recognize the elevated
    importance of the utility of the defendant’s conduct where the interference is

    of evidence available about the characteristics of the locale that were critical
    to the reasonableness assessment. Antrim operated its business in an area
    adjacent to a highway. That highway posed a significant safety risk to the
    general public. The Camerons knew, even when they purchased their property,
    that a new highway would eventually be built. They had no reason to believe
    that the new highway would be built along the same route as the old one and no
    guarantee that access to their property would not be affected. </span></p>

    to believe that, had the board considered the character of the neighbourhood,
    it would have found this factor to support the reasonableness of the interference.
    A highway was already present in the area. It was universally accepted that the
    existing highway was inadequate for the level of traffic that used it.
    Accordingly, an upgrade was necessary. The new highway needed to be
    significantly different from the old to resolve the safety concerns. The MTO
    ultimately decided that this required a new route and changes to the
    surrounding road network. The interference, therefore, was not only reasonable,
    given the character of the neighbourhood, it was the product of a project,
    undertaken in the public interest, which was essential to the safety of the
    neighbourhood.</span></p>

    neglected to consider whether the interference was the product of any abnormal
    sensitivity on the part of Antrim. Given Antrim operated a facility dedicated
    predominantly to truck traffic, its particular dependence on easy access to the
    highway might have been raised as a relevant consideration in determining the
    reasonableness of the interference.  However, in my view, the argument would have little if any impact given
    it would be difficult to categorize the interference as solely being based on
    Antrim’s sensitivity. My reason for mentioning it is merely to emphasize the
    need to consider all four factors relevant to the determination of whether the
    interference was reasonable as set out in <i>Tock

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Moreover, I am unable to say
    that there is anything unreasonable in the Minister’s use of the land. The
    Minister is authorized – indeed he is charged with the duty – to construct
    highways. All highway construction will cause disruption. Sometimes it will
    damage property, sometimes it will enhance its value. To fix the Minister with
    liability for damages to every landowner whose property interest is damaged, by
    reason only of the construction of a highway on neighbouring lands, would place
    an intolerable burden on the public purse. Highways are necessary: they cause
    disruption. In the balancing process inherent in the law of nuisance, their
    utility for the public good far outweighs the disruption and injury which is
    visited upon some adjoining lands. The law of nuisance will not extend to allow

    public service is involved the factor of the utility of the defendant’s conduct
    must not be disregarded. <i>Indeed, I think
    it must be given substantial weight</i>” (emphasis added). The direction in <i>Mandrake Management</i> employs mandatory

    unreasonable.  As the board reasonably
    concluded, the interference amounted to a “serious impairment in nuisance”.
    However, the interference was such that it fell within the boundaries of what
    the reasonable property owner in the area should be expected to tolerate and
    was the result of a project that served the public interest – more, was
    actually essential to public safety.  Simply
    put, the highway was built to save lives. In the light of the substantial
    weight to be given to this factor in the circumstances, it is difficult to see
    how this change in the access to the Antrim property, particularly given the
    fact that it actually brought the Antrim truck stop in line with the access
    typical of Ontario truck stops, can be viewed as unreasonable.<i></i></span></p>
  <h2><i>Balancing </i></h2>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'> </span></i><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>In failing to properly
    carry out the reasonableness analysis, the board failed to give effect to the
    fundamental purpose of the law of nuisance: balancing the competing rights of
    property owners to use their land as they wish.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>The board did acknowledge
    at p. 11 of its reasons that nuisance involves a “balancing of interests”:</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The Board does not interpret the <i>St. Pierre </i>reasoning as to the necessity of the highway
    construction as argued to be obiter, but rather a finding in that case on
    whether on its facts and with the necessary balancing of interests was the
    second test of being actionable at common law met.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>Unfortunately, it
    failed to balance. Instead, after identifying factors that had been advanced by
    the parties as to the reasonableness of the interference, the board proceeded
    directly to its conclusion that the interference was substantial on the basis
    that access to Highway 17 was not “as before”. On this alone, without
    contrasting the public benefit with the private detriment and without
    explaining how one outweighed the other, the board concluded that there was a
    common law claim in nuisance. With respect, this was not enough. The board was
    required to consider whether the interference suffered by Antrim was reasonable
    when balanced against the public interest in the project causing that
    interference. That the interference was substantial is only one element of the
    equation.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    to Antrim’s access, while significant but clearly far from complete, is
    measured against the reasonableness of the MTO’s use of its land, in an area through
    which a highway already ran, for the purpose of protecting the public from
    danger, the conclusion must be that Antrim has not made out a case in nuisance.  </span></p>
  <h2>3.         The
    “construction not the use” test</h2>

    it is not necessary to address the third issue the MTO raises in this appeal –
    that Antrim is not entitled to damages as it cannot satisfy the “construction
    not the use” test.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>However, for the sake
    of completeness, I will do so by briefly explaining why I would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

    Divisional Court both correctly articulated the “construction not the use”
    test. Coates &amp; Waqué, at p. 10-154.27, clearly indicate that interference
    of the nature in question here should be considered the product of
    construction, not use. If the harm alleged was a loss of traffic flow (which
    does not appear to be compensable in law in any event: see <i>Re Municipal Expropriation Act Gross and Gross v. City of Saskatoon </i>(1970),
    73 W.W.R. 272 (Sask. Dist. Ct.), at para. 18), there would be a strong argument
    that the loss was the product of the use of Highway 417 as, had the highway not
    been opened, the traffic may have continued to use Highway 17. However, the
    interference alleged is the change in the access to the truck stop property.
    This is the product of the physical changes to Highway 17, which forces traffic
    travelling in one direction to take a detour to reach the property. It is these
    physical changes, the “completed fact of construction” (Coates &amp; Waqué, at
    p. 10-74.13), which cause the interference.  </span></p>

    this issue relate more closely to the significance of the interference than the
    nature of the interference. It argues that the test is unsatisfied because
    access was only impeded by the construction, not eliminated entirely. However,
    the degree of interference, while an important consideration in whether or not
    the claim would have been actionable at common law, at least where the common
    law claim is framed in nuisance, is not relevant to this stage of the injurious
    affection test. Even if the interference is only minimal, provided it is the
    product of the construction and not the use, it will satisfy the “construction
    not the use” rule.</span></p>
