    for the purpose of establishing that an officer had grounds to make an approved

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted Mr. Soules’ evidence that he
    remained at the scene of the collision and answered the questions of Constable
    Bucci because he understood that he was required by law to do so.  He held that the statements were statutorily
    compelled and inadmissible pursuant to <i>R.
    v. White</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417.  Based
    on <i>R. v. Powers</i> (2006), 213 C.C.C.
    (3d) 351 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No.
    452, the breath results were excluded under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> because in the absence of those
    statements there was no reasonable suspicion for the approved screening device
    demand.  Mr. Soules was acquitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further held that the breath results
    would also be excluded under s.&nbsp;24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> because of the violation of Mr. Soules’ right to counsel
    under</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span class=GramE>s</span>.&nbsp;10(b) by the failure to give a <i>Prosper</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";"Times New Roman";'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> warning.   The trial judge held that it
    was unnecessary to consider Mr. Soules’ additional argument that ss. 258(1<span

    decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed from the acquittal on the basis that
    there was no breach of s. 7 or s. 10(b), and if there was a breach then the
    evidence should not have been excluded.  In brief written reasons, the summary conviction appeal judge upheld the
    s. 7 <span class=GramE>violation</span> and the exclusion of the breath results
    under s. 24(1).  As a result, he found it
    unnecessary to consider s. 10(b).</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is a proper case for leave to a second

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both the summary conviction appeal judge and the
    trial judge erred in their application of <i>Powers</i> and its ruling on s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Further, even if the statements made by Mr.
    Soules infringed s. 7, it is a reasonable limit on that right pursuant to s. 1
    of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>

    not considered by the summary conviction appeal court,</span> this court should
    consider whether Mr. Soules’ s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights were breached and whether the evidence should have been excluded

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>For
    the following reasons, while I would grant the Crown leave to appeal, I would
    dismiss the appeal entirely.  I am
    satisfied that this case, because of </span><span lang=EN-US>the <i>Charter </i>implications for
    drivers and police, clearly raises an issue of significance to the general
    administration of justice.  Nevertheless,
    I am also satisfied that</span><span lang=EN> this

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 1: Leave to appeal<i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court established in <i>R. v. R.R.</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), and has repeated
    numerous times since then, that leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 should only
    be granted in two distinct categories of cases:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=GramE>Where the merits of the proposed
    question of law are arguable, even if not strong, and the proposed question of
    law has significance to the administration of justice that goes beyond the
    particular case.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where there appears to be a “clear” error even if
    it cannot be said that the error has significance to the administration of
    justice beyond the particular case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, at para. 27 of <i>R.R.</i>, Doherty J.A emphasized that access to this court for a second
    appeal “should be limited to those cases in which the applicant can demonstrate
    some exceptional circumstance justifying a further appeal.” </p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    significance to the general administration of justice in this province for two

    whether or not a person's <i>Charter </i>rights have been violated; and (ii)
    the granting or denial of <i>Charter </i>relief as a result.  First, the Crown submits that the decisions
    below wrongly render inadmissible any statements made by an accused under
    compulsion at the scene of a collision, even for the limited purpose of
    establishing grounds for a breath demand and not as evidence of guilt.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the Crown submits that the s. 10(b) ruling in this case creates an absolute
    rule that in every case where a detainee changes his or her mind about speaking
    to counsel, additional information must be provided by the police.  This court, it says, has rejected such an
    interpretation<i>, </i>therefore this
    ground of appeal is also deserving of leave on the basis of strong merit. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Soules disagrees and argues that the present case
    cannot be brought under either of the two permissible categories to warrant
    granting of leave to this court.  That
    is, its issues of law are not sufficiently meritorious, nor does it raise a
    significant question for the administration of the justice system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His position is that the two arguments advanced in the
    leave application are virtually the same as those raised on the summary
    conviction appeal.  Apart from the leave
    issues, the appellant raises two questions of law – the rule against self
    incrimination and the right to counsel – which, Mr. Soules argues, are based on
    well-settled and consistently applied principles of law.  The appellant is merely challenging the
    application of these firmly settled <i>Charter</i> principles. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would, as I said, grant leave to appeal.  This is a case of first impression for this
    court.  The trial courts in Ontario
    currently rely on the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>White </i>as interpreted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Powers.</i>  That, together with <span lang=EN-US>the <i>Charter </i>implications for drivers and
    police, raises issues of significance to the general administration of justice
    so as to warrant leave to appeal.</span></p>

    a policy argument, the Crown submits that the holding below “has the potential
    to cripple the investigation of drinking and driving offences where a collision
    has occurred”.  More specifically, the
    Crown argues that admission of the statement to establish reasonable suspicion
    for an ASD demand does not infringe s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, or that such infringement is justifiable under s. 1.  </span></p>

    that the statements in that case went to an essential element of the offence
    charged, whereas the statements in <i>Powers</i> and in this case were not tendered as evidence of guilt.  <i>White</i>,
    the Crown argues, does not address the admissibility of compelled statements
    for establishing reasonable grounds for a breath demand, and it did recognize

    with the relevant statutory provisions, I believe a brief summary of <i>White</i> and <i>Powers</i> will assist in tracking my analysis.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Summary of <i>White</i> and <i>Powers</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R. v. White</i> involved a charge of failure to stop at the scene of an accident (<i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 252(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a)) in British Columbia.  The victim was struck by a passing vehicle at about midnight.  The next morning, the driver of that vehicle
    called the police to report the incident.  She provided her name, date of birth, and address.  An officer then attended at her home.  The driver described the incident and
    provided her driver’s licence.  She was
    then given <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 10(b) caution.  After contacting her lawyer, she told the
    officer she would not provide a statement.  She then answered additional questions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant provision then in force – s. 61 of the British
    Columbia <i>Motor Vehicle Act</i>, R.S.B.C.
    1979, c. 288 – was analogous to s. 199 of the Ontario <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, except for s. 61(7) which was a use-immunity
    provision.  The trial judge accepted that
    the accused subjectively believed she was required by law to report the
    accident.  He excluded her statements to
    the police on the basis that they violated the s. 7 <i>Charter</i> right against self-incrimination, and then dismissed the
    charge because no evidence remained as to the identity of the driver.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the court of appeal dismissed the
    Crown’s appeal.  In dissent Southin J.A.
    held that the automatic exclusion of all statutorily-compelled statements was
    overbroad – the name and address of the driver, and the fact that they were
    driving at a certain place and time, would not necessarily offend the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the Supreme Court, Iacobucci J. for the majority
    held at para. 30 that “[s]tatements made under compulsion of s. 61 of the <i>Motor Vehicle Act</i> are inadmissible in
    criminal proceedings against the declarant because their admission would
    violate the principle against self-incrimination.”  In particular he held that: the relationship
    between a driver and an officer receiving an accident report is potentially
    adversarial, because of the officer’s dual role in receiving reports and
    investigating crime; the prospect of unreliable confessions is quite real
    because of the strong incentive to provide a false statement; and there is a
    danger of abusive conduct by the state.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to claim the protection of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, Iacobucci J. held at para. 75
    that a driver must establish on a balance of probabilities an “honest and
    reasonably held belief that he or she was required by law to report the
    accident to the person to whom the report was given”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Powers</i> was an
    over 80 case that involved facts similar to those in our case.  The accused in <i>Powers</i> was involved in a collision.  When the attending officer asked who had been driving the vehicle, the
    accused identified himself as the driver.  His eyes were red and his breath had the odour of alcohol.  The officer made an approved screening device
    demand and the accused failed.  He then
    gave a breath sample that read over 80.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge accepted the evidence of the
    accused that he identified himself as the driver because he thought he was
    required to do so.  <span lang=EN>She found that to admit his admission that he was
    the driver of the vehicle in the ditch into evidence at trial would contravene
    s. <span style='color:black'><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>7</span></span> of the <i>Charter</i>.</span>  She excluded the admission, leaving no
    evidence <span lang=EN>that the officer had
    reasonable grounds to make the ASD demand.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal court upheld the
    decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal held at para. 13 that the statement
    contravened s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> following <i>White</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question on this case is whether, as the Crown
    contends, <i>White</i> allows for a
    different result in the circumstances of this case.  For the reasons that follow I have concluded
    that it does not.  Although the use of
    the statement in this case is less direct than it was in <i>White</i>, the evidence was a necessary link in the chain of evidence
    necessary to convict Mr. Powers.  As I
    read <i>White</i>, the Supreme Court of
    Canada has given a conclusive answer to the question which we are bound to
    apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on <i>White</i>,
    the court also rejected the Crown’s alternate arguments that: (1) the use of
    the statement for the limited purpose of establishing a proper foundation for
    making the device demands is a reasonable limitation under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>; or (2) the statement should not
    be inadmissible under s. 24(1).  (See
    paras. 32 and 38.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With that background I now turn to the two remaining
    issues, which relate specifically to the grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-US>Issue 2:
    Sections 7 and 1 of the <i>Charter</i>; the
    application of <i>Powers</i> in Ontario.</span></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s submission here is that <i>Powers</i> should not be followed in Ontario
    and that both the trial judge and the summary conviction appeal court judge
    erred by relying on that case.  In the
    Crown’s view the limited admissibility of Mr. Soules’ roadside statements
    either did not infringe his right against self-incrimination guaranteed by s. 7
    of the <i>Charter</i>, or represented a
    reasonable limit on that right pursuant to s. 1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Crown seems to argue that <i>Powers</i> itself is wrong in not holding
    that compelled statements at the scene of a collision were admissible for the
    limited purpose of forming part of a police officer’s “reasonable suspicion” to
    make an ASD demand.  <i>Powers</i>, and the decisions in this appeal, it is noted, do not apply
    the <i>Orbanski/Elias</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    purpose.  <span lang=EN>That is, the evidence is admissible for the
    limited purpose of establishing reasonable grounds for Constable Bucci to make
    an ASD demand. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown argues that while cases such as </span><i>Orbanski/Elias</i><span lang=EN-US> are
    not collision cases, the infringement in issue is no greater than that of
    admitting statements in a collision case.  Roadside statements such as those in our case, therefore, should be
    admissible as grounds for a breath demand as a reasonable limit on drivers’
    rights under s. 1.  That is, even if
    there is <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 7 infringement, the Crown submits that
    it ought to be justifiable under s. 1.  Protecting against “the carnage caused by impaired drivers” is a
    pressing and substantial objective.  The
    Crown put its position this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A
    complete bar on admissibility of road-side statements in collision cases
    constitutes a windfall for impaired drivers who have become involved in a
    collision.  The decisions below cripple
    police investigation of impaired driving at the scene of a collision, where the
    need for these preventative powers is most pressing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As I
    explain, I would reject each of the Crown’s arguments.  In the end I trust it will be clear that <i>Powers</i> correctly interpreted and applied
    the <i>White</i> decision, which in turn
    were correctly followed by the courts below in our case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In <i>Powers</i>, the majority referred to <i>Orbanski/Elias</i> and held that <i>White</i> was determinative of the issue.  That is, statutorily compelled statements
    were not admissible for any purpose including for the purpose of establishing
    reasonable grounds: <i>Powers</i> at para.
    38.  It is this portion of <i>Powers</i> that the Crown contends cannot be
    correct.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>To illustrate its view, the Crown notes that a</span> motorist’s compelled
    participation in an ASD test is admissible to support an officer’s grounds to
    make a breath demand: <i>R. v. Thomsen</i>,
    [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640.  Therefore, the
    Crown argues, it must also be the case that compelled statements made at the
    scene of a collision are admissible when they are being used for the same
    limited purpose.  The Crown points out
    that in both cases: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the evidence emanates from the accused; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>they invoke the same level of concern regarding
    the potential for self-incrimination;  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it is an offence to fail to participate or

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The
    Crown’s reliance on <i>Thomsen</i> and other
    like cases is misplaced, and for a very noteworthy reason: the questioning by
    police in those cases does not involve compelled answers.  In each of them the motorist can refuse to
    answer if he or she chooses; they are not forcefully enlisted in aid of their
    own prosecution.  For example, in the
    case of a breath demand made by a police officer pursuant to s. 254(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the motorist is legally
    obligated to comply with the demand; nevertheless, s. 7 continues to furnish
    him or her with the right to choose whether or not to speak with the police – a
    choice statutory compulsion clearly eradicates.  There is absolutely no legal compulsion to speak or provide information
    in any of the cases cited. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In
    the result, <i>Powers</i> was correct to
    hold that <i>White</i> was determinative of
    the issue.  The statutorily compelled
    admission from Mr. Soules in our case is not admissible for the purpose of
    establishing grounds for making either the ASD or the breath demand.  Indeed, as Iacobucci J. made clear in <i>White</i> at para. 70:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The protection afforded by the principle against
    self-incrimination does&nbsp;not vary based upon the relative importance of the
    self-incriminatory information sought to be used.&nbsp; If s. 7 is engaged by
    the circumstances surrounding the admission into evidence of a compelled
    statement, the concern with self-incrimination applies in relation to all of
    the information transmitted in the compelled statement.&nbsp; Section 7 is
    violated and that is the end of the analysis, subject to issues relating to s.
    24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown’s arguments on this issue rely almost
    exclusively on jurisprudence such as <i>Orbanski/Elias</i> directed at the s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> right to counsel exemption in drinking and driving cases.  However, despite the strong connection
    between ss. 7 and 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the two are not mutually exclusive.  As I
    believe the above quote from <i>White</i> illustrates, although it is a well established principle that s.10(b) rights
    are limited until arresting officers have developed reasonable and probable
    grounds to effect an arrest, the choice of whether or not to remain silent – and
    thus prevent self-incrimination – nevertheless remains.</p>

    Crown makes the further argument that</span><span lang=EN> the distinctions between the British Columbia
    legislation and the Ontario legislation are important.  </span><span lang=EN>While t</span>he British Columbia<i> </i>legislation
    expressly prohibits the use of statements compelled by the requirement to
    report a collision “in a trial or proceeding arising out of the accident”, the
    Ontario legislation contains no such limitation on the admissibility of this
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, both the trial judge and the summary
    conviction appeal judge in our case came to the correct result on this
    point.  <span lang=EN style='color:black;
'>I would begin with the apt comments of Wein J. in </span><i>R. v. DaCosta</i> (2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d)
    520 (Ont. S.C.) at para. 33:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[It cannot] be realistically said, that anything
    turns on the distinctions between the British Columbia legislation and the
    Ontario legislation… notwithstanding that the Ontario legislation is far less
    specific than the B.C. legislation concerning use immunity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use immunity created by a provincial statute cannot
    extend to proceedings under the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>, because it would be <i>ultra vires</i> the province to restrict
    the admissibility of evidence in criminal matters: <i>White</i> at para. 35.  As
    Iacobucci J. explains further in para. 72, the purpose of this type of
    provincial legislation is not to assist the police in the investigation of
    specific crimes; rather,&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The provinces are entitled to inquire into factual
    circumstances that may involve the commission of a criminal offence, but their
    jurisdiction does not extend so far as to trench upon the federal power under
    s. 91(27) of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i> over the criminal law. [Citation
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use immunity therefore is limited to the jurisdiction
    of the provincial legislature and relates to whether or not there has been
    compliance with the legislated reporting requirement.  Thus, although the Ontario <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> does not have
    similar use immunity provisions, this simply means that in Ontario the
    statutorily compelled accident report can be used to prove non-compliance as
    required by the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>;
    nothing more. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Iacobucci J. in <i>White</i> at para. 60 explained that the inclusion of use immunity provisions, like those
    in British Columbia, in relation to an accident report in subsequent proceedings
    means an intention to use them to gather information for non-litigious purposes
    only:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he partnership between the individual driver and
    the state does not encompass the use of the compelled accident report to
    incriminate the driver.  The fact that
    the statements in this case are sought to be introduced in criminal rather than
    regulatory proceedings simply serves to accentuate the fact that the Crown
    seeks to use the statement for a purpose that was never contemplated as being a
    component of the regulatory regime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, this argument respecting the difference

    moving to the last argument in this ground of appeal, I will make some brief
    comments on the Crown’s submission that this interpretation of the law “has the
    potential to cripple the investigation of drinking and driving offences where a
    collision has occurred”.  The Supreme
    Court in <i>White</i> essentially disagreed
    with this concern, Iacobucci J’s observations at para. 64 are instructive:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he possibility is real and serious that
    permitting the use of compelled accident reports within criminal proceedings
    might increase the likelihood of abusive conduct by the state.&nbsp; In taking
    accident reports from drivers, police would have a strong incentive or perhaps
    an unconscious inclination to overemphasize the extent of the statutory duty to
    report an accident under the Act, in order to obtain relevant
    information.&nbsp; The effect of such an overemphasis might be to circumvent or
    defeat a driver’s s. 7 <span class=GramE>right</span> to remain silent when
    under investigation for a criminal offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was accepted in <i>White</i> that the effect of statutory provisions such as those under consideration in
    this case is to create a logistical difficulty for police.&nbsp; That is, if
    the desire is to use information acquired from a motorist in criminal
    proceedings, the information cannot derive from the duty of the motorist
    mandated by the statutory provisions: para. 65.  Iacobucci J. then at para. 80 stressed the importance of the police
    taking an accident report while simultaneously investigating a crime to
    describe clearly to the motorist the start and end points of the accident
    report.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At various places in his reasons Iacobucci J. describes
    several ways in which police might investigate so as to acquire information
    independently of the accident report that is subject to use immunity.  One, he says, is to inform the driver that
    they intend to secure the details of the accident report from sources other
    than the driver, thus terminating the statutory duty to report.  Second,<b> </b>they might tell the driver that they will postpone the taking of an
    accident report until after they have questioned him or her. (See paras. 65 and

    the above, I think it is an unfounded argument that use immunity arising from
    the information mandated by provincial legislation such as that in this case
    has the “potential to cripple the investigation of drinking and driving

    ground of appeal: that e<span lang=EN-US>ven if
    there is <span class=GramE>a</span> s. 7 infringement, it is justifiable under

    as in the case of the ASD test, the infringement of s. 7 in the circumstances of this case represents a reasonable limit on that
    right.  It says that “measures aimed at protecting the public

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>Given that </span><span
class=apple-style-span><span style='line-height:200%;

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 3: Consideration of s.
    10(b) of the <i>Charter</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed the trial judge’s findings on both
    s. 7 and s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The summary conviction appeal court judge
    ruled that since he upheld the finding that Mr. Soules’ right against
    self-incrimination was violated, it was unnecessary for him to consider the s.
    10(b) issue.  The Crown argues that this
    court should do so.  It relies on this
    court’s decision in <i>R. v. Flis</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 384.  <i>Flis</i> is not helpful to the Crown on this
    point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the issues before the summary conviction appeal
    judge in our case are entirely different from those that were of concern and
    addressed in <i>Flis</i>.  <i>Flis</i> was a case in which this court allowed the respondent in a Crown appeal to
    raise additional alleged errors by the trial judge in an effort to sustain the
    order of the summary conviction appeal court: <i>Flis</i> at para. 55.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end our case was fully decided on the s. 7 <i>Charter</i> issue.  The core issue engaged the principle against
    self-incrimination.  As Iacobucci J.
    makes clear at para. 70 in <i>White</i> –
    which is set out in more detail above – if s. 7 is violated, the analysis is
    ended, subject to issues relating to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where s. 7 applies to provide use immunity in relation
    to compelled statements in subsequent criminal proceedings – as it does in this
    case – exclusion of the evidence is compulsory.&nbsp; And, although the
    evidence can be excluded under the common law duty because admission would
    render the trial unfair, it can also be excluded pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>: see <i>White</i> at para. 89.  This is precisely what occurred in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was within the discretion of the summary conviction
    appeal judge to make a ruling on s. 10(b) in this case.  However, because the <span lang=EN-US>self-incrimination issue alone is determinative
    of this appeal, the summary conviction appeal judge did not have to go beyond
    what he did.  It was unnecessary for the
    appeal judge, and it is unnecessary for this court, to consider the s. 10(b)
    issue.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have previously concluded, I think this is a
    proper case for leave to appeal to this court pursuant to s. 839 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  However, for the reasons given above, I would
    dismiss the appeal.  In my view, neither
    the summary conviction appeal court judge nor the trial judge erred in their
    application of <i>Powers</i> and its ruling
    on s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Further, <span class=apple-style-span><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>I would give no
    consideration to the argument</span></span> <span
class=apple-style-span><span style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>of justification under s.&nbsp;1 because it was not raised below
    and was only raised in a cursory fashion on this appeal.  </span></span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, </span>because the <span lang=EN-US>self-incrimination
    issue alone is sufficient to decide this appeal, I conclude that it was
    unnecessary for either the appeal judge or for this court to consider the s.
    10(b) <i>Charter</i> issue.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
