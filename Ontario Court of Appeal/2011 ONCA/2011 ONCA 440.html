  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.  <u>Introduction</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issue on this appeal is whether the provincial offences appeal court judge erred
    in law in upholding the dismissal of three counts – counts 1, 2 and 4 – in an
    information.  The case arises out of the
    death of an employee of the respondent Black &amp; McDonald Limited at a
    construction site in Ottawa.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    City of Ottawa hired the respondent, Thomas G. Fuller and Sons Ltd., as the
    general contractor on a project to upgrade the Fleet Street Pumping
    Station.  Fuller retained Black &amp;
    McDonald as a subcontractor.  Yves
    Blondin, a supervisor with Black &amp; McDonald, was accidentally killed during
    the construction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Ministry of Labour laid charges under the <i>Occupational
    Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 against both Fuller and Black
    &amp; McDonald in an eight count information, of which counts 6, 7 and 8 were later
    withdrawn.  Counts 1, 2 and 3 laid
    charges against Fuller; counts 4 and 5 laid charges against Black &amp;
    McDonald.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
    a seven day trial in the Ontario Court of Justice, the trial judge convicted
    Fuller on count 3 and Black &amp; McDonald on count 5, and fined each
    respondent $85,000.  However, the trial
    judge dismissed counts 1, 2 and 4, holding that they were “duplicitous” and
    “fail to disclose an offence, in clear and simple terms”.  Each respondent appealed its conviction.  The Crown cross-appealed against the
    dismissal of counts 1, 2 and 4, and against the sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    appeal, the appeal court judge set aside the convictions and entered
    acquittals.  He concluded that each
    respondent had made out the defence of due diligence.  The appeal court judge also dismissed the
    Crown’s cross-appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    respect of counts 1, 2 and 4, although he did not agree with all of the trial
    judge’s reasoning, the appeal court judge concluded that the trial judge had
    reached the correct result.  In the
    appeal court judge’s view, there was duplication or overlapping among all five
    counts and the trial judge had exercised his discretion reasonably in reducing
    the number of counts against each respondent to one. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown sought leave to appeal under s. 131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33.  Armstrong J.A. denied leave to appeal from
    the acquittals on counts 3 and 5.  However, he granted leave to appeal from the dismissal of counts 1, 2
    and 4.  He wrote that the Crown “has
    raised a question of law concerning the validity of the charges, the answer to
    which … is essential for the due administration of justice.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the Crown’s appeal, and order a new
    trial on counts 1, 2 and 4.</span></p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>B.    <u>Additional
    Facts</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Fleet Street Pumping Station provides clean drinking water to commercial and
    residential buildings in the Ottawa area.  Fuller was hired to do the main construction work at the station.  Its work included laying large pre-cast
    concrete pipe sections in the underground trenches in order to carry water from
    the pumping station.  Fuller had not
    performed this type of installation before, so it brought in Black &amp;
    McDonald as a mechanical subcontractor.  Black &amp; McDonald had some experience with this installation, and
    provided both workers and a supervisor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    wooden framework was used as a brace to pull the pipe sections into place.  On the day of the incident – February 21,
    2006 – Mr. Blondin went down in the trenches.  A vertical section of the wooden framework snapped.  A piece broke off, struck Mr. Blondin in the
    head and killed him.  The Crown’s theory
    was that the wooden framework was not designed or constructed to resist the
    forces to which it was subjected.</span></p>

    barely discloses an offence”.  In short,
    according to the trial judge, counts 1, 2, and 4 “fail to disclose an offence,
    in clear and simpler terms” and “[a]bsent ‘particulars’ a defendant might be

    that duplicates or overlaps another count.  A count is duplicitous if it offends the single transaction rule – that
    is, it joins separate and distinct offences in the same count: see <i>R. v. Papalia</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256; <i>R v. Selles</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 332
    (C.A.).  The single transaction rule is
    codified s. 25(2) of the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Each
    count in an information shall in general apply to a single transaction and
    shall contain and is sufficient if it contains in substance a statement that the
    defendant committed an offence therein specified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Here,
    each count alleges a single offence.  No
    count offends the single transaction rule.  Neither Fuller nor Black &amp; McDonald suggested otherwise.  Additionally, a number of counts in an
    information, each arising out of the same incident and even overlapping or
    duplicating each other, does not create a duplicitous charge.  A single incident may give rise to multiple
    charges.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>However,
    even if the trial judge used the word duplicitous to try to express his view
    that the counts were repetitive, he erred in dismissing counts 1, 2 and 4 on
    that basis, as I will explain below. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
    trial judge was obviously concerned, from the way the charges were drafted,
    that Fuller and Black &amp; McDonald would not know the case against them.  However, each count is drafted precisely in
    the wording of the relevant sections of the Act and s. 31(1)(a) of the
    Regulation.  Offences drafted in the words
    of a statute or a regulation are presumed to be valid.  For example, in <i>R. v. Rowley </i>(1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 230, at p. 232, a majority of
    this court upheld the validity of an information “[h]aving regard to the fact
    that the information does charge an offence and charges that offence in the
    exact wording of the section of the Code under which it was laid”.  See also <i>R.
    v. Milberg </i>(1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 45 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 49-50.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>A
    defendant is entitled to sufficient particulars of each charge.  Section 25(6) of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> states: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>A count
    shall contain sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence to
    give to the defendant reasonable information with respect to the act or
    omission to be proved against the defendant and to identify the transaction
    referred to.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
    five counts in the information complied with s. 25(6).  Some particulars were given.  Neither Fuller nor Black &amp; McDonald asked
    for more particulars.  Neither claimed
    that it did not know what it was charged with or that any of the charges failed
    to disclose an offence.  The trial judge
    dismissed counts 1, 2, and 4 on his own initiative, and he was wrong to do so.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN style='font-weight:normal;'>(b) <u>Reasons of the Appeal Court</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
    provincial offences appeal court judge exacerbated the trial judge’s
    errors.  He gave two reasons of his own
    for upholding the dismissal of counts 1, 2 and 4.  First, he said, “there is definitely
    duplication and/or overlapping between all five counts.”  Second, he said that the trial judge had
    exercised his discretion reasonably in reducing the number of counts to one
    against each defendant.  I do not agree
    with either reason.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN>(i) <u>The counts can overlap </u></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I
    accept that some of these counts overlap with others; however, that does not
    make any of the counts objectionable.  A
    single incident may give rise to more than one charge.  As Cory J.A. said in <i>Milberg </i>at p. 49, “It is manifest that many offences are capable of
    being committed in more ways than one under the provisions of the Code.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
    trial judge should have adjudicated on all five counts and made findings on
    each of them.  If he convicted either or
    both defendants on all charges, he could then decide whether to conditionally
    stay one or more charges under the rule against multiple convictions:  see <i>R.
    v. Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729; <i>R.
    v. Provo</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3.</span></p>
  <p>(ii) <u>The appeal court judge erred in holding that
    the trial judge could collapse a valid information</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal court judge was wrong to say that the trial
    judge had discretion to reduce the number of counts to one count against each
    defendant.  No such discretion
    exists.  A trial judge cannot collapse an
    information by dismissing some of the counts simply because those counts may
    overlap with other counts arising out of the same incident.  To give a trial judge that discretion would
    improperly interfere with the Crown’s discretion to lay the charges it deems
    appropriate.  The appeal court judge
    therefore erred in upholding the dismissals on counts 1, 2, and 4.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, Fuller and Black &amp; McDonald put
    forward two other bases to dismiss the appeal.  First, they argue that the trial ought to have applied <i>Kienapple</i> to counts 1, 2 and 4 because
    they were subsumed in the two more general counts, 3 and 5.  Second, they argue that their due diligence
    defence, which succeeded on counts 3 and 5 before the appeal court judge, is
    bound to succeed on counts 1, 2, and 4.  I do not accept either argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Supreme Court of Canada made clear in <i>Provo, </i>the application of the rule in <i>Kienapple</i> against multiple convictions
    does not result in an acquittal; it results in a conditional stay.  Therefore, assuming the trial judge had made
    findings of guilt on all five counts, even if he had applied <i>Kienapple</i> to counts 1, 2 and 4, at most
    he could have ordered a conditional stay.  He could not have acquitted the defendants or dismissed the charges
    against them.  And once the appeal court
    judge overturned the findings of guilt on counts 3 and 5, the conditional stays
    on counts 1, 2 and 4 would have been set aside and the findings of guilt on
    these counts restored.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants’ due diligence defence succeeded on
    counts 3 and 5.  That does not necessarily
    mean a due diligence defence would succeed on counts 1, 2 and 4.  As I said earlier, counts 3 and 5 are aimed
    at different conduct from counts 1, 2 and 4.  The two sets of counts may overlap each other but they do not duplicate
    each other.  Counts 3 and 5 address the
    alleged failure of Fuller and Black &amp; McDonald to take reasonable
    precautions at the construction site to protect Mr. Blondin.  Counts 1, 2, and 4 address alleged design and
    construction deficiencies in the pipe and wooden framework.  If Fuller and Black &amp; McDonald have a due
    diligence defence to counts 1, 2 and 4, they must establish that defence at
    trial.</p>
