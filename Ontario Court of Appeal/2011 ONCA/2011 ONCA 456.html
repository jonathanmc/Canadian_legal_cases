  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
    December 2, 1999 operative report, Dr. Anderson made the observation that the
    feeding tube had recoiled into the abdominal wall and that feed “had leaked a
    little bit through <i>right where the
    jejunum was attached</i> (emphasis added).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    in context, the reasonable and obvious meaning of “attached” as it appears in
    the December 2, 1999 operative report is “sutured”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>In describing
    the </span><span lang=EN-US>jejunum</span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'> as “attached”,
    Dr. Anderson was not describing a step taken during the December 2, 1999
    surgery. Rather, he was describing the situation he encountered when he re-opened
    the patient on that date. As was explained by the appellant’s expert, Dr.
    Anderson would have been able to make this observation by taking down the
    sutures he originally made.</span><span lang=EN-US> The concessions made by the respondents’
    expert, Dr. Colapinto, in cross-examination that when something is sutured it
    is attached and that at least one of the other two sutures necessary to meet
    the standard of care for inserting a feeding tube were performed, even though
    not referred to in the November 26, 1999 operative report, support this
    conclusion. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In all the circumstances, in our view, it was
    simply not open to the trial judge to prefer Dr. Colapinto’s opinion evidence
    over the only direct evidence at trial concerning the steps taken during the
    November 26, 1999 surgery.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence of the experts who testified at trial
    concerning whether Dr. Anderson sutured the jejunum to the abdominal wall was
    neither direct evidence nor fact evidence; rather, it was opinion evidence
    premised largely on a review of the two operative reports. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, there was no physical evidence that
    supported the opinion of Dr. Colapinto that the word “attached’ as it appears
    in the December 2, 1999 operative report does not mean sutured. In particular,
    there was no physical evidence to support the conclusion that Mr. Ortolan’s
    stomach cavity was infected with jejunum contents as well as feed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>Finally, as
    was noted by the respondents’ expert, the possibility that the jejunum could
    have attached naturally at the exact location on the abdominal wall where the
    feeding tube was located was remote in the extreme. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>Moreover,
    contrary to the trial judge’s line of reasoning, the fact that the feeding tube
    became dislodged did not support the conclusion that Dr. Anderson failed to
    suture the </span><span lang=EN-US>jejunum to the abdominal wall. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted above, in his December 2, 1999 operative
    report, Dr. Anderson observed that the feeding tube had recoiled into the
    abdominal wall. Although perhaps rare, there was no dispute that this is a
    known complication arising from insertion of a feeding tube. The fact that this
    complication occurred could not assist in determining whether Dr. Anderson
    sutured the jejunum to the abdominal wall. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>Considered
    in context, in our opinion, it is unreasonable to conclude that “attached” as
    it appears in the December 2, 1999 operative report means anything other than “sutured”.</span><span
lang=EN-US> This is
    particularly so when the respondent’s expert, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Colapinto</span>,
    conceded in cross-examination that “sutured” and “attached” mean the same
    thing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his December 2, 1999 operative report, Dr.
    Anderson described exactly what happened in clear terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I realized then that [the feeding tube] had
    recoiled and gone right into the abdominal wall …. <span class=GramE>and</span> there was a collection the size of my fist in the abdominal wall that had
    leaked a little bit through right where the jejunum was attached…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This is disappointing because the #8 feeding tube
    was sutured with <span class=GramE>an</span> 0 <span class=SpellE>Ethibond</span> which is almost as big as the tube and yet even this would not hold it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>In lay
    terms, what Dr. Anderson was saying was that the outer suture attaching the
    feeding tube to the skin came undone with the result that the feeding tube slid
    into the abdominal wall and some of the feed, which was being pumped through
    the abdominal wall under pressure, leaked out where the jejunum was attached to
    the abdomen. This was an unfortunate and tragic accident that resulted in the
    untimely death of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Ortolan</span>, but it was not caused
    by any negligence on the part of Dr. Anderson.</span></p>
