    legislative regime.  In order to obtain a

    the years following Dr. Lipsitz’s initial applications for licences, the CPSO,

    several occasions, the CPSO advised the Director that Dr. Lipsitz’s centres
    were not being operated in accordance with appropriate standards and in some
    instances that they presented a risk to the health, safety and welfare of
    persons.  On receiving the reports, the

    the appeals, the Director permitted Dr. Lipsitz to continue to operate in accordance
    with specified standards.  Before any of
    the appeals were heard by the HSARB, Dr. Lipsitz entered into Minutes of
    Settlement with the Director and the CPSO on terms and conditions that
    permitted him to continue to operate or to transfer operating licences to
    others.  In each case, Dr. Lipsitz

    Crown, two individuals who were Directors under the <i>IHFA</i> during the relevant time period, and two others who were
    managers of the Independent Health Facility Program (the “Ontario appellants”);
    and 2) the College defendants, i.e. the CPSO and nine individuals who were

    his statement of claim, Dr. Lipsitz alleges that from 2001 to 2007, the
    appellants engaged in a “closure campaign”.  As part of that campaign, they routinely engaged in excessive and unreasonable
    investigations and assessments and took reckless and unjustified steps to close
    his sleep disorder centres.  This
    improper conduct required him to operate the centres under unreasonable and
    expensive restrictions designed to make it impossible for him to continue.</span></p>

    prices.  </span></p>

    it is a collateral attack on the administrative proceedings for resolving
    licensing issues under the <i>IHFA</i>; 3)
    the claim is an abuse of process because Dr. Lipsitz is seeking to re-litigate
    issues that were or should have been disposed of in Dr. Lipsitz’s appeals to
    the HSARB; 4) Dr. Lipsitz’s allegation about the CPSO’s investigations pursuant

    on the leave motion to the Divisional Court.  As part of this argument, he submits that the motion judge’s orders with

    launched on these aspects of the motion judge’s decision.  In the event that the court does not consider

    s. 38.1.  In my view, the section provides
    immunity for those conducting inspections, investigations and assessments to
    the extent that the losses for which compensation is claimed result from one of
    the actions specified in the section.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issue is one of statutory interpretation.  The well accepted approach to interpreting a statute is that “the words
    of an <i>Act</i> are to be read in their
    entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with
    the scheme of the <i>Act</i>, the object of
    the <i>Act</i> and the intention of
    Parliament”: see, for example, <i>Canada
    (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa,</i> [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339, at para. 38.
    This approach typically involves courts considering the language of the
    provision in issue, the context in which the provision is found, and the
    purpose and scheme of the legislation.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    language in s. 38.1 is straightforward.  It can best be analyzed in two parts.  The first relates to the entities or individuals to whom the section
    affords protection.  The language is
    expansive.  It applies to the Crown, the
    Minister, the Director and to anyone who is engaged in the administration of the <i>Act</i>.  Significantly, I suggest, the section may include persons carrying out
    the activities mentioned by the motion judge, namely, “investigations,
    inspections or assessments”.  Thus, if
    investigators, inspectors or assessors are engaged in the administration of the <i>Act</i>, the first part of the
    requirement for immunity under s. 38.1 has been met.</span></p>

    second part of s. 38.1 sets out the types of losses which are shielded by the
    section.  The effect of the second part
    is to limit the protection to only losses suffered as a result of the Minister
    or Director doing one of the actions specified in the section.  These actions are regulatory orders and are
    central to the decision-making scheme of the <i>IHFA</i>.   Thus, in general terms, s. 38.1 provides
    immunity for losses resulting from certain regulatory orders made under the <i>Act</i>.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>  Thus, administrative actions such as
    investigations, inspections and assessments that lead to an order referred to
    in s. 38.1 are protected for losses resulting from the order.  For example, if a Director refuses to issue a
    licence based on an inspection report, and damages ensue, not only does the
    Director have immunity for those damages, so does the inspector who prepared
    the report.  There does, however, have to
    be a link between the inspector and the order expressly protected by s. 38.1.</span></p>

    note that s. 20(1) of the <i>IHFA</i> requires the Director to give notice to a licensee when he or she proposes to
    make some of the types of orders referred to in s. 38.1 in other than emergency
    situations.  Under s. 20(1), the Director
    must give a licensee notice if the Director proposes to revoke, suspend or

    wrongly concluded that Dr. Lipsitz was not operating the sleep disorder centres
    in accordance with appropriate standards and, in some instances, was operating
    the centres in a way that presented risks to the health and safety of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Section

    report would be admissible in a civil action if the College did not pursue the
    matter to a hearing, but not if there was a hearing.  Similarly, a letter of complaint could form
    the basis of a civil suit by a doctor against the complainant if the College

    documents that cannot be admitted at trial, that paragraph may be struck out on
    a motion”.  The court indicated that such
    a motion should be brought under Rule 25.11.  The motion in this case was brought under that rule.</span></p>

    I see no basis to interfere with the motion judge’s decision to strike Dr.
    Lipsitz’s allegations pertaining to the College’s investigations of his
    professional conduct.  I agree with the
    motion judge’s comment at para. 34 of his endorsement where he said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I
    would simply add, for the plaintiff’s benefit, that although the documentation
    is inadmissible, the fact that a complaint was made or that an investigative
    proceeding was commenced may be provable at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the result, the cross-appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></u></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would dismiss the appeals and the cross-appeal.  In my view, the immunity issue and the abuse of process issues should remain
    open at trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would set aside the motion judge’s costs order in favour of Dr. Lipsitz.  I would leave the issue of costs of the
    motion to the trial judge.  On my view of
    the appellants’ arguments on immunity and abuse of process, Dr. Lipsitz’s
    claims in the civil action will be significantly narrowed, if not disposed of
    entirely at trial on the basis of these arguments.  The exercise at trial will be to determine
    what portion, if any, of his civil claim should survive.  In those circumstances, I think it makes
    sense to reserve the costs of the motions below to the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would make no award with respect to costs of the appeal.  There has been mixed success.  On the one hand, the appellants have
    succeeded in reducing their exposure because of the view I take of the immunity
    and abuse of process arguments.  The
    appellants were also successful in having Dr. Lipsitz’s cross-appeal
    dismissed.  On the other hand, I would
    not dismiss Dr. Lipsitz’s action or strike his statement of claim as the
    appellants asked this court to do.  In
    that respect, Dr. Lipsitz has realized some success.</span></p>
