style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), claims that it is
    entitled to unilaterally and without court sanction effectively freeze accounts
    belonging to the respondent, Ankur Rastogi (Rastogi), pending the results of
    its action against Rastogi.  Three of those accounts are RBC accounts, two are
    accounts with the other appellant, RBC Direct Investing Inc. (RBC Direct), an
    affiliate of RBC, and one account, an account that Rastogi holds jointly with
    his wife, is with the Toronto Dominion Bank (TD).  Belobaba J. (the motion
    judge) agreed that RBC was entitled to freeze its own accounts but ordered that
    the accounts at RBC Direct and TD should be released immediately to Rastogi. 
    RBC and RBC Direct appeal from that order.  Rastogi has not appealed from the
    order made with respect to the RBC accounts and the status of these accounts is
    not in issue on this appeal.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellants submits that although Rastogi purported to
    bring the motion under Rule 44, the motion was in reality a motion for summary
    judgment.  Counsel argues that the motion judge effectively gave judgment on
    some of the claims advanced by RBC and by Rastogi in his counterclaim and that
    he erred in doing so in the face of several triable issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with counsel for RBC that Rule 44 had no application.  This was
    in reality a motion for summary judgment on Rastogi’s entitlement to the funds
    in his accounts.  However, I agree with the motion judge that RBC had no basis
    in law to prevent Rastogi from accessing his funds in RBC Direct and TD.  This was
    an appropriate case for summary judgment in the terms of the order made by the
    motion judge.  I would vary the parts of the order referable to the accounts at
    RBC Direct and TD to a judgment in the same terms, and would otherwise dismiss
    the appeal.</p>

    2007 and September 2008 Rastogi misused his position as an employee of RBC to

    able to make the trades at prices that ensured him a profit and an equivalent
    loss to RBC.  RBC alleges that in operating the scheme to his personal

    Instead, it froze Rastogi’s three accounts with RBC.  It also, presumably by
    virtue of its relationship with RBC Direct, froze both of Rastogi’s accounts with
    RBC Direct.  RBC then commenced this action and, by naming the TD as a
    defendant, effectively froze Rastogi’s account at TD.  Pursuant to s. 437(2) of
    the <i>Bank Act</i>, S.C. 1991, c. 46, TD declined to pay the funds in the

    Dominion Securities Inc. (RBC Dominion).  Rastogi admits that he engaged in currency
    trading on his own behalf.  He alleges, however, that he used publicly
    available information and traded at the rates set by RBC.  Rastogi maintains
    that his trading was well known to the RBC representatives at the branch where
    he kept his accounts.  He contends that he did nothing that breached his
    contract of employment or made improper use of information available to him as
    an employee.  Rastogi goes on to assert that RBC did not suffer any loss as a
    result of his currency trading.  </span></p>

    Direct and TD do not come exclusively from the profits earned in his currency
    exchange trading and that, by freezing those accounts without any authority to
    do so, RBC has made it impossible for him to pay his outstanding debts, such as

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Motion Judge’s Ruling</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC claimed that Rastogi owed it some $700,000.  There was about
    $100,000 in Rastogi’s three RBC bank accounts.  The credit in those accounts
    represented a debt owed by RBC to Rastogi.  The motion judge held, at paras.
    8-12, that RBC could claim a set off of the credits in Rastogi’s account
    against any debt owed by Rastogi to RBC.  The set off claim justified RBC’s
    refusal to release the funds in Rastogi’s RBC accounts unless ordered to do so
    following a trial of the merits of the respective claims.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge determined that RBC Direct had no claim against Rastogi
    and therefore no debt that it could purport to set off against the credit in
    Rastogi’s accounts at RBC Direct.  The motion judge also rejected the argument
    that because of the corporate affiliation between RBC and RBC Direct, RBC was
    entitled to treat Rastogi’s accounts in RBC Direct as if they were accounts in
    RBC.  The motion judge said at para. 13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>More importantly, Direct Investing (“DI”) makes no
    claim against Rastogi.  It has no legal basis, in set off or otherwise, for
    freezing his accounts and holding on to his funds, absent a court-granted
    injunction, which in all likelihood would not be granted on these facts.  In
    any event, no such injunction has been sought by DI.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found no basis to withhold Rastogi’s funds held by TD
    (paras. 16-21).  He held that RBC’s mere assertion that it was entitled to a
    tracing order could not provide the basis for withholding Rastogi’s funds.  The
    motion judge also rejected RBC’s contention that s. 437(2) of the <i>Bank Act</i> gave RBC a right to freeze Rastogi’s accounts at TD.  The motion judge interpreted
    s. 437(2) as merely giving TD the option of interpleading the funds into court
    or holding the funds pending court order once TD was sued.  TD had chosen the
    latter course.  The motion judge concluded at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>RBC’s claim for a tracing order is not enough,
    absent an injunction or some other court order or at least some proof of legal
    entitlement, to justify any further retention by the TD Bank of depositor Rastogi’s
    funds.  In my view, these funds should be released immediately.</p>

    That rule applies to a motion for an “interim order” made under s. 104(1) of

    63.  Although RBC Direct is not a bank, I see no reason to treat credits in the
    RBC Direct accounts any differently.  Those credits represented a debt owed by
    RBC Direct to Rastogi.  </span></p>

    conclusion as to whether a debt is included within the phrase “personal

    application to a debt, Rastogi was not seeking an interim order for possession
    of property, and was not offering to post any security.  Rastogi wanted the release
    of his funds plain and simple.  The order made by the motion judge reflects the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rastogi’s claim to the funds in RBC Direct and TD is straightforward. 
    The credit in those accounts represents debts owed to him by RBC Direct and
    TD.  He has demanded payment.  Neither RBC Direct nor TD advanced any claim
    against Rastogi, much less a claim that would give rise to any right of set
    off.  Counsel for Rastogi submits that RBC does not, merely by commencing a
    lawsuit in which it claims a right to the funds, acquire any right to
    unilaterally prevent Rastogi from obtaining those funds.  Counsel contends that,
    absent a court order, RBC was not entitled to preemptively interfere with
    Rastogi’s rights in respect of his accounts at RBC Direct and TD.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC’s claim that the funds should not be released to Rastogi rests on
    the assertion that the material filed on the motion demonstrates that RBC has
    an arguable claim to a restitution order with respect to the funds.  RBC
    asserts that its remedy goes beyond damages and that the funds in those
    accounts in fact belong to RBC.  The restitutionary claim is based on either a
    constructive trust flowing from Rastogi’s breach of his duties to RBC, or on
    RBC’s mistaken payment of the funds into Rastogi’s accounts at RBC.  RBC
    maintains that its arguable restitutionary claim, combined with the
    uncontroverted evidence that some of the proceeds of the currency trading are
    in the accounts in issue, is enough to give RBC a valid interest in those funds
    and create what counsel called a “interpleader situation” as between RBC and
    Rastogi.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC’s position confuses its undenied right to pursue its restitutionary
    claims and any right it has to unilaterally deprive Rastogi of his property
    while RBC pursues its restitutionary claim.  The fact that RBC has an arguable
    case would certainly preclude Rastogi from obtaining summary judgment on RBC’s
    restitutionary claim.  The mere fact that RBC has an arguable restitutionary
    claim, however, does not give it any right to interfere with Rastogi’s property
    pending a determination of the merits of that claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC’s restitutionary claim comes down to the assertion that the funds in
    Rastogi’s accounts at RBC Direct and TD belong to RBC and not to Rastogi.  If
    RBC had concerns about the disputed property disappearing before trial, it
    could have sought an interlocutory injunction.  Had RBC chosen to do so,
    however, it would have been required to show more than an arguable case before
    it could obtain an order freezing those accounts.  Under the well-known
    tripartite test in <i>RJR MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,
    [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, RBC would have been required to show:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An arguable case (serious issue to be tried);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Irreparable harm if injunctive relief was not granted;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The balance of convenience favoured injunctive relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC cannot escape the tripartite test for injunctive relief because the
    nature of the property in issue has permitted RBC to unilaterally achieve a <i>de
    facto</i> injunction without a court order.  Surely RBC would not argue that it
    was entitled to go into Rastogi’s garage and unilaterally seize his vehicles
    and hold them until trial if it had an arguable case that the vehicles were
    purchased with the proceeds of the currency trading.  I do not see how RBC’s
    legal position is improved because the assets in issue are debts owed to
    Rastogi by another bank and an affiliate of RBC.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For whatever reason, RBC has not sought an interlocutory injunction in
    the two years since it started this action.  RBC is not entitled to what would
    effectively be an interlocutory injunction merely by showing that its
    allegations, including those related to his restitutionary claims raise
    arguable issues.  On the motion record, Rastogi’s entitlement to the funds
    vis-à-vis RBC Direct and TD is undeniable.  He is their creditor.  RBC’s
    entitlement to the funds is contingent upon RBC establishing the merits of its
    claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any entitlement RBC has to freeze Rastogi’s accounts pending trial is
    not improved merely because RBC Direct is a subsidiary of RBC.  RBC accepts
    that the credit in Rastogi’s RBC Direct accounts constituted a debt owed by RBC
    Direct.  While the relationship between RBC Direct and RBC permitted the latter
    to freeze Rastogi’s accounts by what counsel for RBC referred to as an
    “internal demand”, the subsidiary status does not make the debts of RBC Direct
    debts of RBC.  The two are separate corporate entities.  RBC cannot claim any
    right to set off of a debt owed by RBC Direct to Rastogi against a debt owed by
    Rastogi to RBC.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with the motion judge’s interpretation of s. 437(2) of the <i>Bank
    Act</i>.  That section gives TD the right to hold the funds in Rastogi’s
    account that it would otherwise be obligated to pay on demand to Rastogi.  That
    right is triggered by RBC’s claim in which it names TD as a defendant.  Section
    437(2) does not give RBC any rights in respect of the funds in Rastogi’s TD
    account or inhibit the court’s power to make orders directing payment of funds
    out of those accounts.     </p>

    no legal basis upon which either RBC Direct or TD can withhold the funds held
    by them to the credit of Rastogi.  There are no issues requiring a trial in
    respect of Rastogi’s entitlement to those funds.  Rastogi is entitled to summary
    judgment on his counterclaim to the extent that the claim seeks judgment
    directing the return to him of all funds held in Rastogi’s accounts at RBC
    Direct.  He is similarly entitled to judgment on the crossclaim to the extent
    that he seeks judgment directing that TD release all funds in Rastogi’s joint
    account to him.  </span></p>
