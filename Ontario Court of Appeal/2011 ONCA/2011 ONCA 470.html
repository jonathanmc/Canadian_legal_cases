  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 267.8(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, <span class=GramE>c</span>. I. 8
    provides that in an action for loss or damage from bodily injury arising from
    the use or operation of an automobile, the damages to which a plaintiff is
    entitled shall be reduced by payments for statutory accident benefits that the
    plaintiff has received or that were “available”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, for the purposes of the motion
    that gives rise to this appeal, it was agreed that the plaintiff was entitled to
    two types of statutory accident benefits: income replacement benefits and
    caregiver benefits.  He was required to elect
    which of the two he would receive from his insurer.  He elected to receive caregiver
    benefits.  Were the income replacement
    benefits “available” to him within the meaning of s. 267.8(1)?  As I will explain, in my view, the answer to
    that question is “no”. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 23, 2006, Derrick Sutherland, the plaintiff, was
    rear-ended by <span class=SpellE>Gurmeet</span> Singh, one of the defendants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Sutherland has a wife and three children.  At the time of the accident, he was employed
    full-time as a machine operator at <span class=SpellE>Winpack</span>.  He claims that because of the injuries he
    sustained in the accident, he was temporarily unable to return to work <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>and </span>unable to perform his
    pre-accident <span class=SpellE>caregiving</span> duties for his three
    children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of his motor vehicle liability policy
    and s. 268(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, Mr.
    Sutherland was entitled to the statutory accident benefits (SABS) set out in the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule –
    Accidents on or After November 1, 1996</i>, O. Reg. 403/96 (the Regulation).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An insured person injured in a motor vehicle accident
    may qualify for a weekly income replacement benefit (IRB), a non-earner benefit
    or a weekly caregiver benefit (CGB).  Because Mr. Sutherland was employed at the time of the accident, he was not
    eligible for a non-earner benefit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Sutherland’s insurer notified him that he might
    qualify for the SABS benefits.  Along
    with the notice, the insurer included an OCF-10 election form, which it asked Mr.
    Sutherland to complete.  The form
    required him to elect which of the benefits he wished to receive.  It made clear that he could receive only one type
    of the SABS benefits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Sutherland elected to receive CGBs. His insurer
    paid him CGBs for the period during which he remained unable to provide care for
    his children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2008, Mr. Sutherland issued a statement of claim in
    which he claimed for, among other things, past income loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants sought to deduct, from Mr. Sutherland’s
    past income loss, the value of the IRBs that were available to him but which he
    never received because he had elected to receive CGBs.  They maintained that prior to his election, Mr.
    Sutherland could have chosen IRBs and, therefore, those payments were “available”
    within the meaning of section 267.8(1) of the <i>Insurance Act. </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Sutherland brought a motion to have the matter
    determined as a question of law.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge agreed with the defendants and dismissed
    the motion.  He noted that s. 267.8(1)
    entitles the defendants to deduct benefits that were available to Mr.
    Sutherland and that the purpose of the provision, as acknowledged by the
    parties, is to prevent double recovery.  Nonetheless, at <span class=SpellE>para</span>. 13 of his reasons for
    decision, he concluded that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the term available must be given its
    usual plain language meaning in the context of section 267.8(1).  Where at the point of making his election for
    SAB benefits, the plaintiff can choose to receive income benefits but chooses
    not to as in this case, such benefits must be understood to have been
    “available” to the plaintiff at the point of the election.  If available, then according to the
    provisions of 267.8(1), such benefits may be deducted from the damages to which
    the plaintiff is entitled.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Sutherland appealed to this court.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After the oral hearing of the appeal, the court
    advised the parties that the appeal would be allowed, with reasons to follow.  These are the promised reasons.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raised a single issue:  were IRBs “available” to Mr. Sutherland within
    the meaning of s. 267.8(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, given that he properly
    elected to receive CGBs?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 267.8(1) and 268(1) of the <i>Insurance Act </i>are referred to throughout
    the reasons.  They read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>            267.8  </b>(1)<b>  </b>In an action for loss or damage from
    bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>               1. All payments in respect of the incident
    that the  plaintiff
    has received or that <b><i>were</i></b> <b><i>available</i></b>  before the trial
    of the action for statutory accident
    benefits in respect of the
    income loss and
    loss of earning capacity. [<span class=GramE>emphasis</span> added]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>            </b>(6) In an action for loss or
    damage from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the use

    pecuniary loss, other than the damages for income loss or loss of earning
    capacity and the damages for expenses that have been incurred or will be
    incurred for health care, shall be reduced by all payments in respect of the
    incident that the plaintiff has received or that were available before the
    trial of the action for statutory accident benefits in respect of pecuniary
    loss, other than income loss, loss of earning capacity and expenses for health
    care.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>268.    </b>(1) Every contract evidenced by a motor
    vehicle liability policy, including every such contract in force when the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i> is
    made or amended, shall be deemed to provide for the statutory accident benefits

    amendments to the <i>Schedule</i>, subject
    to the terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions and limits set out in that <i>Schedule</i>, c. 10, s. 26 (1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 4(1), 13(1) and 36(1) of the Regulation are
    relevant to this appeal.  They read as
    follows:</p>

    267.8 entitles a defendant <span class=SpellE>tortfeasor</span> to deduct from
    the damages it must pay a plaintiff, among other things, any sum the plaintiff has
    received under SABS or could have received under SABS because it was available
    for IRBs (s. 267.8(1)) or pecuniary loss, such as CGBs (s. 267.8(6)).  The parties accept, and I agree, that the
    purpose of s. 267.8 of the <i>Insurance Act </i>is
    to prevent double recovery: see <span class=SpellE><i>Bannon</i></span><i> v. <span

    the purposes of the motion, the parties agreed that Mr. Sutherland was eligible

lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    36(1) of the Regulation stipulates that only one of the IRBs, CGBs or a
    non-earner benefit may be paid to a person.  As mentioned earlier, non-earner benefits are not relevant in this
    case.  Given that s. 36(1) stipulates
    that a person may only receive one type of benefit, once Mr. Sutherland elected
    to receive CGBs, in my view IRBs were no longer available to him.  It would not be fair to allow the defendants,
    who are the <span class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span>, to reduce the damages they
    ought to pay by an amount that Mr. Sutherland never received and, once he
    elected to receive CGBs, he could not receive.      </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    benefits, despite the fact that they were available to him, and that he must
    bear the consequences of his decision.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    argument ignores two things. First, it ignores the fact that Mr. Sutherland had
    to make an election.  Section 36(1) of
    the Regulation says he may be paid only one of the SABS benefits.  Therefore, he had to make an election.  Once he elected to receive CGBs, he could not
    be paid IRBs.  In that sense, the IRBs
    were not available to him.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    this argument ignores the underlying purpose of s. 267.8, which is to prevent
    plaintiffs from double recovery for their losses.  If the defendants’ argument is correct, they
    will be entitled to credit for both CGBs, which Mr. Sutherland received, and
    IRBs, which he never received.  This
    would lead to a situation in which Mr. Sutherland is undercompensated and the
    defendants would receive a windfall.  This
    would not be a fair result and it cannot have been intended.  The purpose of s. 267.8 is to ensure that
    plaintiffs do not receive double compensation – not to create a windfall for <span
class=SpellE>tortfeasors</span>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A final comment is in order.  While counsel for the defendants on appeal
    (not the same as counsel below) submitted that the decision below was correct
    and should be upheld, he also argued that there were certain factual matters in
    dispute that made it inappropriate to have this issue decided as a question of
    law.  For example, he queried whether Mr.
    Sutherland was properly entitled to claim CGBs.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This position is logically inconsistent.  The court could not ratify the decision below
    if that decision was made on a fundamentally flawed procedural basis.  In any event, it is not available given the
    way in which this matter unfolded.  The
    motion judge dealt with this matter on the basis that “[t]he significant facts
    are not in dispute” (<span class=SpellE>para</span>. 2 of the reasons for
    decision).  At the oral hearing of the
    appeal, counsel for the defendants below confirmed (through counsel for the
    defendants on appeal) that he had, for the purposes of the motion, conceded
    that Mr. Sutherland was entitled to CGBs and properly made his election for the
    same.  Neither this court nor the court
    below made those findings.  Both courts
    simply acted on the facts as agreed to by the parties.  Thus, there were no factual questions that
    precluded the motion judge or this court from deciding the question of law in
    issue.        </p>
