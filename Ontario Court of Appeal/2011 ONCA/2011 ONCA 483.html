style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An interim spousal support order is made.  Can the order be appealed as
    of right or only with leave?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This question lies at the heart of this appeal.  Its resolution involves
    a significant constitutional challenge based on the doctrine of federal
    paramountcy.  Conflicting caselaw from across Canada tells us that there is no
    easy answer to it.        </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Claude Frederick Elgner, the appellant, and Carol Ann Elgner, the
    respondent, separated in June 2007 after thirty-three years of marriage.  Mr.
    Elgner is now 63 years old; Ms. Elgner is 62.  They have three adult children,
    none of whom is a child of the marriage for support purposes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 2, 2009, pursuant to s. 15.2 of the <i>Divorce Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), Greer J. ordered Mr. Elgner to pay <span
lang=EN-GB>interim spousal support of $110,000 per month, and retroactive
    spousal support of $3,360,000 for the period from January 2008 to December 2009
    (the interim order).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Elgner wishes to appeal the interim order.  He moved to file a
    notice of appeal as of right or, if leave to appeal is required, that leave be
    granted.  Justice Sachs, sitting as a single judge of the Divisional Court,
    dismissed the motion by order dated March 17, 2010 (the first Divisional Court
    order).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Elgner then moved for a review of the first Divisional Court order by
    a full panel of the Divisional Court.  He sought only a review of that part of
    the order dismissing his motion for an order permitting him to file his appeal
    as of right.  He did not seek a review of Sachs J.’s refusal to grant leave to
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated September 9, 2010, a panel of the Divisional Court
    dismissed the motion (the order under appeal), holding that leave to appeal the
    interim order was required.  The Divisional Court gave two sets of reasons for
    dismissing the appeal.  Justice Herold wrote reasons with which Lederman J.
    concurred (the majority or the majority decision).  Justice Jennings wrote
    concurring reasons (the minority or the minority decision).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> With leave of this court, Mr. Elgner brings this appeal.  He argues
    that he is entitled to appeal the interim order as of right – that leave to
    appeal is not required.  He bases his appeal on s. 21(1) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>,
    which provides that, with two exceptions that do not apply in the present case,
    “… an appeal lies to the appellate court from any judgment or order, whether
    final or interim, rendered or made by a court under this Act”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Elgner contends that s. 21(1) of the <i>Divorce Act </i>gives the
    right of appeal for all orders, interim and final, made under the <i>Divorce
    Act</i>.  As the <i>Divorce Act</i> is federal legislation, he says that right is
    paramount over s. 19(1)(b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C. 43 (the <i>CJA</i>), which requires leave to appeal from interlocutory orders
    of judges of the Superior Court of Justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the appeal raises a constitutional question and the principle of
    paramountcy, notice was given to both the Attorneys General of Ontario and
    Canada.  Only the Attorney General of Ontario intervened.  It took the position
    that s. 19(1)(b) of the <i>CJA </i>is not rendered constitutionally inoperative
    by virtue of s. 21 of the <i>Divorce Act </i>and the doctrine of paramountcy. 
    Thus, like Ms. Elgner, the Attorney General of Ontario submitted that leave to
    appeal is required and the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I explain below, I agree with the majority
    decision of the Divisional Court.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>THE DECISIONS BELOW</b><b> </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>            <b><i>The First Divisional
    Court Order </i></b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based on the decision in <i>Kral v. Kral</i> (1994), 68 O.A.C. 188 (Div. Ct.), Sachs J., sitting as a single judge of the
    Divisional Court, held that Mr. Elgner required leave to appeal the interim
    order<i>. </i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Kral</i>, the Divisional Court observed that
    s. 21(6) of the <i>Divorce Act</i> provides that appeals are to be asserted in
    accordance with the ordinary procedure governing appeals.  Section 21(6) of the <i>Divorce Act </i>reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Except as otherwise provided by
    this Act or the rules or regulations, an appeal under this section shall be
    asserted, heard and decided according to the ordinary procedure governing
    appeals to the appellate court from the court rendering the judgment or making
    the order being appealed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, the Divisional Court reasoned in <i>Kral</i>,
    s. 21(6) of the <i>Divorce Act </i>authorizes the requirement for leave set out
    in s. 19(1)(b) of the <i>CJA</i>.  Consequently, there is no conflict between
    the two provisions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Justice Sachs considered <i>Kral </i>to be
    binding upon her.  She noted that in deciding <i>Kral</i>, the Divisional Court
    relied on the statement of Finlayson J.A. in <i>Colletta v. Colletta</i> (1992),
    10 O.R. (3d) 464 (C.A.), at para. 5, that leave to appeal is required in
    respect of interim orders under the <i>Divorce Act</i>.  She further noted that
    in <i>Kral</i>, the Divisional Court adopted the reasoning of Carruthers J.,
    sitting as a single judge, in <i>Potts v. Potts </i>(1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 284
    (Div. Ct.), to the same effect.  Justice Sachs concluded by observing that the
    ruling in <i>Kral</i> furthers the legitimate policy objective of discouraging
    appeals from interim orders in family law matters, which cause additional
    expense, emotional anguish and delay to the parties. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Justice Sachs refused to grant leave to appeal
    the interim order because the proposed appeal raises no issues that transcend
    the private interests of the parties or questions of law requiring resolution
    by a higher judicial authority.  Any issues that are raised require resolution
    by the trial judge, who will have a full opportunity to assess the parties’
    credibility and the evidence.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <b><i>The Order under Appeal</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court gave two sets of reasons for dismissing the appeal. 
    It is instructive to consider both.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <b>The Majority Decision</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority endorsed the reasons of Sachs J.  They stated that ss.
    21(1) and (6) of the <i>Divorce Act</i> must be read together.  In light of the
    conflicting interpretations that these provisions have been given, they viewed them
    to be ambiguous.  Consequently, they stated that policy considerations – as
    well as context – could inform their interpretation.  The majority quoted with
    approval the policy considerations that Sach J. identified and which are set
    out at para. 15 above.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority went on to note the anomalous situation that would result
    if a judge dealt with a motion for interim support under the <i>Divorce Act </i>and
    for interim exclusive possession under the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. F.3.  If Mr. Elgner’s position is correct, leave would not be required to
    appeal the interim support part of any order that was made but it would be
    required for the interim order in respect of possession of the matrimonial
    home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority opined that s. 21 must be interpreted within the context of
    the “gatekeeper” function played by the courts, which is becoming more
    necessary and acceptable in our judicial system, in order to prevent the
    situation where the person with the deepest pockets or the inclination and
    ability to argue motions and appeals can wear down his or her opponent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When read in context, the majority concluded that s. 19(1) of the <i>CJA </i>is not inconsistent with s. 21 of the <i>Divorce Act</i>.  Section 19(1) does
    not take away a substantive right to appeal – it merely sets out the procedure
    for asserting and enforcing that right.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority acknowledged the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Kelvin
    Energy v. Lee</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 235 (<i>Kelvin Energy</i>), which held that wording
    similar to that in s. 21(1) of the <i>Divorce Act</i> gave an absolute right of
    appeal from an order made under the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (<i>CBCA)</i>.  However, it did not find <i>Kelvin Energy</i> to be significant because there is no comparable section in the <i>CBCA</i> to
    s. 21(6) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <b>The Minority Decision</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The minority would have dismissed the appeal solely on the ground that
    the panel was bound by <i>Kral</i>.  However, he expressed serious reservations
    about the correctness of <i>Kral</i>.  He analysed Ontario lower court
    decisions and decisions of the Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Quebec
    courts of appeal, all of which have held that leave is not required to appeal
    interim orders made under the <i>Divorce Act</i>.  He concluded that the weight
    of judicial authority on the interpretation of s. 21 is contrary to the
    conclusion reached in <i>Potts</i>.  In his view, these contrary authorities
    are consistent with the plain language of s. 21(1).     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The minority also differed from the majority in finding it incompatible
    for legislation to grant an absolute right of appeal but require that leave be
    granted.  He observed, at para. 40 of the reasons, that “a right to apply for a
    right to appeal is not a right of appeal as provided in s. 21.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the minority expressed reservations about whether admittedly sound
    policy considerations should affect the court’s interpretation of s. 21, saying
    that if Parliament has granted an absolute right of appeal, courts cannot do
    other than permit that right to be exercised.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></h4>

    Act </i>provides a direct right of appeal of all orders, interim and final,
    made under the <i>Divorce Act</i>.  Consequently, he argues, s. 19(1)(b) of the <i>CJA</i> conflicts with s. 21(1) because it stipulates that an appeal from an
    interlocutory order of a Superior Court judge lies to the Divisional Court only
    with leave.  Mr. Elgner argues that a provincial law cannot derogate from the
    right of appeal specifically created by a federal statute.  Therefore, because
    the <i>Divorce Act </i>is federal legislation, he says that the doctrine of
    paramountcy applies to render s. 19(1)(b) of the <i>CJA</i> inoperative to the
    extent of the conflict.  He also argues that the Divisional Court erred in
    relying on policy considerations to interpret appeal rights created by s. 21(1)
    of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, given that the language of s. 21(1) is clear and

    interim orders made under that Act, notwithstanding any leave requirement under

    subject to the leave requirement in s. 19(1) of the <i>CJA</i>.  To conclude

    However, Finlayson J.A. did not simply accept this concession.  At para. 5 of <i>Colletta</i>,

    interpretation of s. 21(6).  First, he says that it reads out the words “except
    as otherwise provided by this Act” in s. 21(6).  He submits that the <i>Divorce
    Act </i>“otherwise provides” for an unrestricted right of appeal under s.
    21(1).  Therefore, the incorporation of provincial procedure by s. 21(6) is
    subject to the appeal right granted by s. 21(1).  Second, relying on <i>792266
    Ontario Ltd. v. Monarch Trust Co. (Liquidator of) </i>(1996), 94 O.A.C. 384 (C.A.),
    he argues that a right of appeal is a substantive right, not a matter of procedure. 
    Therefore, the word “procedure” in s. 21(6) does not refer to, or have the
    effect of, incorporating into the <i>Divorce Act </i>the provincial rules
    governing leave to appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the first argument is circular. 
    Section 21(1) does not “otherwise provide” for the way in which an appeal shall
    be asserted.  Section 21(1) sets out the appeal right and s. 21(6) sets out
    how, among other things, that right is to be asserted.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for the second argument, while I agree that a
    right of appeal is a substantive right and not a mere procedural right, nothing
    turns on this point.  A leave to appeal requirement for interim orders in
    divorce matters does not finally determine the rights of the parties. Interim
    orders are designed to be made quickly to meet the immediate needs of the
    claimant and allow the matter to proceed to trial.  Any adjustments that must
    be made to interim orders can be done at the trial.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, by spelling out in s. 21(6) that an
    appeal under s. 21(1) is to be “asserted, heard and decided according to the
    ordinary procedure governing appeals”, Parliament dictated that the provincial rules
    are to be followed when exercising the appeal right given by s. 21(1).  As has
    been noted, s. 19(1) of the <i>CJA </i>was operative when s. 21(6) of the <i>Divorce
    Act </i>was enacted.  It was the “ordinary procedure” in Ontario for asserting
    an appeal from an interlocutory order.  It can be assumed that Parliament, when
    enacting s. 21(6), was aware of the ordinary procedure in place in Ontario.  It
    follows that Parliament could have inserted a provision that excluded the leave
    requirement.  It did not.  Instead, it chose to cede to the provinces the right
    to govern the procedure on appeal.     </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 25 of the <i>Divorce Act</i> reinforces
    this point.  It provides that the provinces may “make rules applicable to any
    proceedings under this Act in a court, or appellate court”.  The power given to
    the provinces in s. 25 expressly includes regulating “practice and procedure”
    (s. 25(2)(a)) as well as regulating “any other matter considered expedient to
    attain the ends of justice and carry into effect the purposes and provisions of
    this Act” (s. 25(2)(g)).   </span></p>

    Parliament: see <i>Bell ExpressVu Ltd. Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R.
    559, at para. 26.  Thus, having considered the words of s. 21(1), in context,
    it is necessary to consider also the object of the <i>Divorce Act </i>and the

    fundamental rethinking of the divorce process through the introduction of a
    no-fault divorce regime.  At p. 33, the Report recommended that the <i>Divorce
    Act </i>create an expeditious process that would avoid delay and enforce limits
    to prevent unreasonable delay.  It is evident that the object of the reforms underlying
    the 1985 amendments was to simplify divorce proceedings, thereby rendering the
    divorce process less expensive and more timely.  Interpreting ss. 21(1) and (6)
    as the Divisional Court did is consonant with Parliament’s intention and the
    object of the amendments to the <i>Divorce Act</i>, which were designed to
    shorten and simplify the divorce process.  </span></p>

    considerations, voiced by Sachs J. and endorsed by the majority, were to
    discourage appeals from interim orders in family law matters because they would
    cause the parties additional expense, emotional anguish and delay.  Although
    referred to as a matter of policy, the Divisional Court was simply taking into
    consideration the object of the amendments to the 1985 <i>Divorce Act</i>.  In
    light of the modern approach to statutory interpretation, set out above, it was

    explained, it is the interplay between ss. 21(1) and (6) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>,
    considered within the context of the purpose of the provision and the underlying
