style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for aggravated assault, assault
    with a weapon and obstruction of justice.  Although his notice of appeal also
    seeks leave to appeal sentence, leave was not pursued and is dismissed as
    abandoned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the complainant was a hostile witness at trial, counsel for
    the Crown sought to have two out of court statements the complainant made
    admitted into evidence on the basis of the principled exception to the hearsay
    rule.  The first was the complainant’s out of court statement made at the
    hospital to Nurse Cowan admitted into evidence as a principled exception to the
    hearsay rule.  The second was the complainant’s video-taped statement made to
    the police.  The necessity of admitting the statements was not contested. 
    There, as here, the issue is the threshold reliability of the statements which
    the trial judge admitted into evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the threshold of reliability was not met for
    a compendium of reasons.  One is that the notes of Nurse Cowan contained the
    wrong date.  Another is that Nurse Cowan was an agent of the police or not a
    disinterested party.  Nurse Cowan did not attend solely to treat the
    complainant but obtained the complainant’s consent to take pictures of her
    injuries and to report the matter to the police.  There is no merit to either
    of these arguments and we dismiss them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further submits that the trial judge erred in holding that
    the statement to Nurse Cowan was reliable because both she and complainant were
    available for cross-examination at trial.  The complainant testified at trial
    that she could not remember making the statements and because she was “drugged
    up” on painkillers.  Since the complainant could not remember what she said,
    the appellant submits that any cross-examination of her with regard to these
    statements could not be effective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, the trial judge did not err in noting that both Nurse
    Cowan and the complainant were available to be cross-examined at trial.  Nurse
    Cowan’s testimony at trial was relevant to proving that the complainant made
    the statements to her despite the complainant’s claim that she could not
    remember doing so.  The complainant’s claim that she could not recall what she
    said at the hospital was doubtful given that she gave a very similar statement
    to the police some months later.  Furthermore, there is no general rule that a
    hearsay statement cannot be admitted in the absence of an opportunity to
    meaningfully cross-examine a declarant.  A declarant’s lack of memory of the
    prior statement is merely one factor to take into account when determining the
    reliability of the statement.  The trial judge found that the complainant made
    the statements while she was still traumatized by the attack and was therefore
    not in a position to be concocting the statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The determination of whether these two hearsay statements were
    sufficiently reliable as to be admissible required the trial judge to perform a
    full assessment of the facts.  His decision is therefore entitled to deference.
     He was clearly cautious about relying on evidence from a complainant who later
    recanted at trial, but found that her statements to Nurse Cowan and the police
    were truthful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has not identified any material misapprehension of the
    evidence or error in principle that would require this court to interfere with
    the trial judge’s decision. The trial judge gave extensive and persuasive
    reasons as to why the complainant’s statements to the nurse and to the police
    were reliable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
