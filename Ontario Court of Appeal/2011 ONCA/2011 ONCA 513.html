  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first ground of appeal concerns the manner in which
    Mr. Clark gave evidence. It is apparent and was conceded by counsel that
    experienced defence counsel chose not to seek a mistrial but, rather, sought to
    make use of the manner in which Mr. Clark gave evidence to undermine his assertion
    that he lied to the police out of fear. This was a reasonable tactical decision
    and defence counsel made it clear in his jury address how the manner in which
    the witness gave evidence could be used. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, it was important that the jury understand that
    Mr. Clark’s gratuitous personal opinions could not be used as evidence. The
    trial judge did make this clear in his charge to the jury in virtually the identical
    terms suggested by defence counsel. The appellant now submits that this
    direction would have led the jury to disregard the manner in which Mr. Clark
    gave evidence in assessing his credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree. The jury was told that they could use
    the manner in which witnesses gave evidence in evaluating credibility. As a
    matter of common sense, the jury would have understood that this instruction
    would especially apply to Mr. Clark. We are satisfied that the trial judge’s
    instructions on this issue were correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground of appeal concerns a single question
    asked by Crown counsel in re-examination of the appellant’s uncle. We are
    satisfied that this was a proper question given defence counsel’s extensive
    cross-examination of the witness about the purpose of the Windsor trip. In any
    event, even if the question was improper, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
    justice was occasioned. The question merely pointed out the notorious and
    obvious fact that Windsor is a border city. The defence was not caught by
    surprise by the question. As we have said, counsel had extensively cross-examined
    the uncle on the purpose of the trip in the obvious effort to blunt the
    possible prejudicial effect of the trip to Windsor shortly after the killing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we note that there was no objection to the
    question and the trial judge refused Crown counsel’s request to give a post
    offence conduct instruction based on the evidence of the Windsor trip.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
