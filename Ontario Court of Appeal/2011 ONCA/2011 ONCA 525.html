    judge erred by staying the application brought by Her Majesty the Queen in
    Right of Ontario in the Superior Court because he concluded an arbitration
    process should be followed. The appeal raises again the scope of the exceptions
    to the general rule stated in <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Dell Computer
    Corp. v. Union des consommateurs</span></i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801 that “in any
    case involving an arbitration clause, a challenge to the arbitrator’s
    jurisdiction must be resolved first by the arbitrator.” </p>

    Court has to do with a settlement of litigation between Imperial Tobacco Canada
    Limited (“ITCAN”) on one side and the governments of Canada and the provinces
    on the other. The governments had brought an action against ITCAN and its
    subsidiaries for their role in the smuggling of tobacco across the Canada-U.S.
    border between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 1996. The parties entered into
    a Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated July 31, 2008.
    Under the Agreement, ITCAN agreed to pay up to $350 million to the governments
    in annual payments over 15 years in exchange for a release from future actions,
    the terms of which I will discuss in detail later in these reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Subsequently, on December 2, 2009, the Ontario
    Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board (the “Tobacco Board”) and four
    tobacco farmers commenced a $50 million class action against ITCAN on behalf of
    growers and producers who were required to sell tobacco through the Tobacco
    Board between 1986 and 1996. The Tobacco Board claims on its own behalf and on
    behalf of growers and producers the difference between the lower export price
    paid by ITCAN to the Tobacco Board for tobacco exported from Canada and the
    higher price that should have been paid for tobacco for domestic use, in
    respect of tobacco which was first exported from Canada and then smuggled back
    into Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Claiming to rely on provisions of the Agreement,
    ITCAN gave notice on March 29, 2010 that, commencing April 30, 2010, it would
    pay the settlement funds due to Ontario under the Agreement into an escrow
    account pending the resolution of the class action. Ontario brought an
    application for declarations that ITCAN was not entitled to withhold annual
    payments to Ontario, which the motion judge dismissed so that the arbitration
    process in the Agreement could be followed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Ontario has appealed the motion judge’s decision to
    this court, arguing that the dispute between Ontario and ITCAN does not fall
    within the arbitration clause, or in the alternative, that this court should
    determine its application in any event to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings
    and the possibility of inconsistent results.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the motion
    judge’s stay of Ontario’s application and confirm his referral of the parties
    to the arbitrator so that the arbitration process set out in the Agreement may
    be followed.  </p>

    The terms “Releasing Entities”, “Released Entities” and “Released Claims” are
    important to understanding s.&nbsp;15. The Agreement defines those terms as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>(a) “Releasing
    Entities” means: “Her Majesty in Right of Canada and in Right of the Provinces
    and includes for greater certainty the Canada Revenue Agency and the Canada
    Border Services Agency.”</span></font></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>(b) “Released
    Claims” include, <i><span style='font-style:italic'>inter alia</span></i>, “all
    civil claims that may be allowable to the Releasing Entities” relating to or
    arising out of the smuggling of tobacco or any failure on the part of ITCAN to
    pay taxes, duties, excise, customs or excise taxes or duties or amounts payable
    on account of smuggled or imported tobacco.</span></font></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4 face="Times New Roman"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>(c) “Released Entities” include ITCAN and
    related companies.</span></font></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[9]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Section 15 provides that the Releasing Entities
    absolutely and unconditionally fully release and forever discharge the Released
    Entities from the Released Claims. Section 15 does not stop there, however.  It
    goes on to provide that if a Releasing Entity does bring a Released Claim
    against a Released Entity, the release may be pleaded as a complete defence and
    may be relied upon as a complete estoppel to dismiss the claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Because of its importance, I set out s. 15 in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>RELEASE</span></font></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>15. The
    Releasing Entities hereby, without any further action on the part of such
    Releasing Entities, absolutely and unconditionally fully release and forever
    discharge, the Released Entities from the Released Claims. Without in any way
    limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Releasing Entities further agree
    that:</span></font></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>(a) in the
    event that a proceeding, claim, action, suit or complaint with respect to a
    Released Claim is brought by Releasing Entity against a Released Entity, this
    release may be pleaded as a complete defence and reply, and may be relied upon
    in such a proceeding as a complete estoppel to dismiss the said proceeding; and</span></font></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4

    incurred by the Released Entity as a result of such proceeding.          </span></font></p>

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Section 7 of the Agreement gives ITCAN additional
    rights in the event that it incurs monetary liabilities “in any way relating
    to, arising out of or in connection with any Released Claims or Claims Over”.
    If ITCAN does incur such monetary liabilities, it has the right to reduce the
    amount of the payments it must make to the government concerned under the
    Agreement. In addition, upon ITCAN learning of the existence of any claim that
    might give rise to such liabilities, it has the right, after giving 30 days’
    notice, to begin paying any funds due to a government under the Agreement into
    an escrow account.</p>

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>In my view, as this case turns on contrasting the
    rights of ITCAN under s. 7 with its rights under s. 15, I examine those rights
    carefully. Section 7 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4 face="Times New Roman"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>Without prejudice to any other rights or
    remedies as provided in paragraphs 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of this Agreement, in
    the event that monetary liabilities (including all fees, expenses and
    disbursements on a full indemnity scale) are incurred by Released Entities in
    any way relating to, arising out of or in connection with any Released Claims
    or Claims Over made by a Releasing Entity or an Entity claiming through or on
    behalf of a Releasing Entity (and for the avoidance of doubt including such
    Government’s crown-controlled corporations or crown agencies) (a “Responsible
    Government”), the amount of the Payment due in the fiscal year in which the
    monetary liabilities are incurred, and Payments due in subsequent fiscal years,
    shall be reduced by such amounts incurred. Upon learning of the existence of
    any claim, action, suit, or proceeding that could give rise to such
    liabilities, ITCAN may, upon giving 30 days’ notice to the Responsible
    Government, begin paying any funds which are then or thereafter due into an
    interest-bearing escrow account, up to the amount claimed in such claim,
    action, suit, or proceeding pending its resolution. The amount by which the
    Payments shall be so reduced or escrowed shall not exceed the then-remaining
    Responsible Government’s share of the Payments (as set out in Schedule “C”
    hereto). </span></font></p>

    while s. 15 provides ITCAN the right to assert a defence to certain claims, s.
    7 provides ITCAN the right to reduce or escrow the payments it must make under
    the Agreement if faced with certain claims. Second, s. 7 applies to a broader
    range of claims than does s. 15. While both sections apply to claims brought by
    a “Releasing Entity”, s. 7 also applies to claims made by “an Entity claiming
    through or on behalf of a Releasing Entity”, a term which includes a
    government’s crown-controlled corporations and crown agencies. Third, s. 7
    applies to give ITCAN the right to reduce or escrow payments regardless of
    whether it has or asserts a defence to the claim under s. 15. This is clear
    because s. 7 applies when ITCAN actually incurs monetary liabilities, a
    situation that could not arise if it had a defence under s. 15.</p>

    Government”. It provides ITCAN with the right to set off against the annual
    payments it makes under the agreement monetary liabilities:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4

    “an Entity claiming through or on behalf of a Releasing Entity” to be a
    Responsible Government. They therefore identify the question disputed as
    whether the Tobacco Board is a Responsible Government. I digress to explain why
    I am uncomfortable with the short form terminology used by the parties. I think
    it is preferable to state the question as whether the Tobacco Board is “an
    Entity claiming through or on behalf of a Releasing Entity”, and not whether it
    is a Responsible Government. </p>

    Government in s. 7 cast doubt on the parties’ characterization of the dispute.
    Section 7 goes on to provide for ITCAN giving 30 days’ notice to the
    Responsible Government of its intention to set off its monetary liabilities.
    Section 7 also provides that the amount of money that ITCAN places in escrow
    “shall not exceed the then-remaining Responsible Government’s share of the
    payments (as set out in Schedule “C” hereto).” The Entity claiming through or
    on behalf of a Releasing Entity does not have a share of the payments and does
    not get notice that such payments are being placed in escrow. The payments
    under Schedule “C” are made to Canada and the provinces. </p>

    Government lead me to think that the term Responsible Government may refer to
    the government responsible for the “Entity claiming through or on behalf of a
    Releasing Entity” and not the Entity itself. That is why I prefer to articulate
    the question as whether the Tobacco Board is an Entity claiming through or on behalf
    of a Releasing Entity, and not whether the Tobacco Board is itself a
    Responsible Government. However, in my review of the parties’ documents, I need
    quote their language referring to the Tobacco Board as potentially a
    Responsible Government. </p>

    Code as the Model Law. Doing so emphasizes that international jurisprudence is
    helpful in the interpretation and application of the statute. In <i><span

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>The rule of systematic referral to arbitration
    rests on art. 8(1) of the Model Law, which requires courts to refer any matter
    subject to an arbitration agreement to arbitration subject to limited
    exceptions. The article provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4 face="Times New Roman"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>A court before which an action is brought
    in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement <u>shall</u>, if a
    party so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the
    substance of the dispute, <u>refer the parties to arbitration</u> unless it
    finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being
    performed. [Emphasis added.]</span></font></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Article 8(1) operates in conjunction with art.
    16(1), which provides in part: “The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction,
    including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the
    arbitration agreement.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Pursuant to arts. 8(1) and 16(1), a court should
    not itself rule on the scope of an arbitration agreement, but should leave the
    issue to the arbitrator. Deschamps J. laid down the general rule in <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>Dell Computer</span></i> “that in any case involving
    an arbitration clause, a challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction must be
    resolved first by the arbitrator”.</p>

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Deschamps J. did, however, carve out two exceptions
    to the rule of systematic referral to the arbitrator:  A court may depart from
    the rule of systematic referral to arbitration if the challenge to the
    arbitrator’s jurisdiction is based solely on a question of law, or on a
    question of mixed law and fact where the question of fact requires only
    superficial consideration of the documentary evidence in the record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>These exceptions must be carefully applied.
    Deschamps J. immediately added that “even when considering one of the
    exceptions, the court might decide that to allow the arbitrator to rule first
    on his or her competence would be best for the arbitration process.” Before
    applying an exception, the court “must be satisfied that the challenge to the
    arbitrator’s jurisdiction is not a delaying tactic and that it will not unduly
    impair the conduct of the arbitration proceeding.”</p>

    not as an exception to the systematic rule of referral, but submits that the
    court can and should decide whether the dispute between Ontario and ITCAN is

    provides for the delivery of a notice of dispute only by ITCAN or Canada.
    Ontario also argues that when the arbitration and dispute resolution provisions
    are read in the context of the entire Agreement, it is clear that the parties
    to the Agreement did not intend to authorize Canada to act as agent for and on
    behalf of the provinces in resolving disputes between ITCAN and one of the

    the other parties to the Agreement have the right to have a dispute dealt with
    under s. 33. It follows, Ontario submits, that none of the other parties to the
    Agreement are able to refer an unresolved dispute to arbitration under s. 34.
    Therefore, Ontario would have the court conclude that s. 34’s arbitration
    provision does not apply to Ontario. </p>

    Canada and Ontario both submit that Canada has no interest in the dispute
    between ITCAN and Ontario, as Canada will receive all of its settlement funds
    due to it under the Agreement. Therefore, Canada has no reason to engage in
    arbitration with ITCAN.</p>

    argument that the arbitration provision does apply to Ontario. The provision is
    broadly worded and states quite plainly that “[a]ny dispute between the Parties
    to this agreement…may be referred to arbitration.” Section 1 of the Agreement
    defines “Parties” as ITCAN and the Governments. “Governments” is defined to
    mean Canada and the provinces. The title of the Agreement states that it is
    made between ITCAN and the Queen in right of Canada and “The Province listed on
    the signature pages attached hereto”. The Agreement was executed by the
    Attorney General of Ontario immediately below the sentence that reads “[t]his
    Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Province of Ontario
    and is enforceable in accordance with its terms”. Section 28 of the Agreement
    provides that it is “binding upon the Parties”. In s. 3 of the Agreement, each
    government warrants that it has obtained all approvals and authorizations to
    execute the Agreement and make it binding upon it. Each government further
    warrants that the Agreement constitutes a legally binding obligation of the
    government and is enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. There is
    no doubt that Ontario is a party to the Agreement.</p>

    under the Agreement. Nor can any of the other provinces. Nor can any of ITCAN’s
    Affiliates or any of the other Released Entities. The Agreement has a detailed
    definition of “Affiliate” and its definition of “Released Entity” includes the
    48 tobacco corporations listed in Schedule B. </p>

    38 provides that “<u>All notices</u> under this Agreement” (emphasis added)
    shall be made to ITCAN or to Canada at specified addresses. Nowhere in the
    Agreement does it provide for the provinces to directly receive notice from
    ITCAN or any of the Affiliates on any matter. Nor does it make any provision
    for any Affiliate to give or receive notice.</p>

    the Agreement is made apparent by several provisions. For example, s. 39
    provides “[a]ll payments shall be made to Canada”. Section 5 is more specific.
    It provides that “ITCAN shall pay to Canada, for Canada, and on behalf of and
    as agent for the Provinces…” the settlement funds provided for in the
    Agreement. Sections 10 and 11 provide that ITCAN shall provide certain
    certificates “to Canada for Canada, and as agent for and on behalf of the
    Provinces” each year. </p>

    Agreement to support its submission that it is structured so that the two
    corresponding parties are ITCAN and Canada, thus avoiding the need for any
    entity to deal with a multiplicity of parties. Certainly, the fact that Canada
    receives and distributes the settlement funds and various documentation as
    agent for the provinces can be taken to suggest that Canada administers the
    Agreement, including the arbitration provisions, on their behalf. </p>

    discussed in <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Bell Canada</span></i> was the
    standard of review to be applied on an appeal of a trial judge’s interpretation

    involved a question of mixed fact and law per se. That perspective led him to
    comment that Feldman J.A.’s conclusion <span lang=EN-US>in <i><span

    181 O.A.C. 19 (C.A.), at para. 34, that “[t]he construction of a written

    standard of appellate review must always be applied to the interpretation of a
    contract. </span>The view Blair J.A. expressed in <i><span style='font-style:

    especially where the determination of the surrounding factual matrix is
    significant to its meaning, should be regarded as a question of mixed fact and
    law for the purposes of the general rule of systematic referral to arbitration.
    The very purpose of art. 8 (1) of the Model Law is to give the arbitrator the
    jurisdiction to determine disputes about the existence and scope of the
    arbitration agreement. This seems to be the view that Sharpe J.A. adopted in <i><span

    makes plain, what the parties <span lang=EN-US>intended by the language of the Agreement,
    viewed objectively, in the circumstances in which the Agreement was made</span> can only be assessed after a careful review of the surrounding factual matrix.
    The comments of Sharpe J.A. in <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Dancap</span></i> at para. 40 about the arbitration clause in that case could equally be made
    about the Agreement in this case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt'>The determination
    of the scope of [</span></font>the agreement<span lang=EN-US>] and the
    arbitration clause will require a thorough review of the parties’ complex
    contractual discussions, understandings, expectations and arrangements, an
    inquiry that clearly calls for much more than a “superficial consideration of
    the documentary evidence in the record.” I conclude, therefore, that on this
    record, the motion judge erred in refusing to stay Dancap’s action on account
    of the arbitration clause.</span></p>

    the arbitration provision applies to any dispute “between the Parties to this
    Agreement” that arises out of or in relation to the Agreement “or any breach,
    clarification, or enforcement of any provision of this Agreement or any conduct
    contemplated herein”. Ontario’s application in the Superior Court is replete
    with questions about the Agreement. It seeks declarations about what is or is
    not a Released Claim by a Responsible Government “for the purposes of the
    Comprehensive Agreement”; it seeks a declaration that ITCAN is not entitled to
    withhold payments “pursuant to the Comprehensive Agreement”; and it seeks a
    declaration that ITCAN is required to make the payments “under the
    Comprehensive Agreement”. </p>

    challenge that it is not a party to the arbitration clause will be up to the
    arbitrator, this language must be considered in the context of this court’s
    conclusion in <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Canadian National Railway

    provides for arbitration, the courts should lean towards honouring that
    option”. </p>

    arbitration provisions involves a question of mixed fact and law. I also
    conclude that Ontario has not established that that question can be determined
    on only a superficial consideration of the documentary evidence in the record.
    Very much to the contrary, a superficial consideration of the documentary
    evidence in the record indicates that it is arguable that the arbitration
    provision applies to Ontario. It is for the arbitrator, in deciding on his or

    court with jurisdiction over the action; and (2) since s. 7 also requires a

    arbitration may well raise issues not found in domestic arbitration cases. For
    example, in international arbitration, the likelihood of multiple proceedings
    and inconsistent results could arise if the courts of different states adopt an
    interventionist approach and take jurisdiction. I pause to note that this case
    involves the federal government and all ten provinces, and many of the Released

    Law to avoid the possibility of multiple proceedings has been considered by the
    courts of appeal in Alberta and British Columbia. Before turning to those
    cases, it is worth recalling that art. 8(1) of the Model Law provides that a
    court “shall…refer the parties to arbitration…unless it finds that the
    agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed”.</p>

    there is no appreciable possibility of a multiplicity of proceedings. I reach
    that conclusion on a cursory review of the Agreement and the documents in the
    record. I stress that it is not the court’s function to interpret the Agreement
    and these documents. That is a matter for the arbitrator. However, in order to
    assess Ontario’s argument it is necessary to take a preliminary view of these
    matters. The preliminary view leads me to conclude that Ontario has not

    inconsistent results.</p>

    and if it did, there is no appreciable risk it would be answered differently.</p>

    the Tobacco Board does not fit within the definition of a Releasing Entity. The
    Tobacco Board is not Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario. No other part
    of the definition could conceivably apply. I consider it extremely unlikely
    that the Tobacco Board would be found to be a Releasing Entity by the
    arbitrator or by the court (assuming the court could be and was called upon to
    address the issue). </p>

    to do with the application of s. 7 of the Agreement and not s. 15. It is s. 15
    that provides ITCAN with a defence to a claim brought by a Releasing Entity.
    Section 7 recognizes that entities may still bring claims against ITCAN that
    result in actual monetary liabilities, but allows ITCAN to set those
    liabilities off against the payments it must make under the Agreement.  Both
    Ontario and ITCAN, in their documents that I review below, characterize their
    dispute not as whether the Tobacco Board is a Releasing Entity, but rather
    whether it is a Responsible Government. </p>

    the question as whether the Tobacco Board is an Entity claiming through or on
    behalf of a Releasing Entity, but in reviewing the parties’ documents, I need
    quote their language. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[84]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>In the notice dated March 29, 2010 that ITCAN
    served on Canada under s. 7 of the Agreement, I see no claim that the Tobacco
    Board is a Releasing Entity or that s. 15 applies. The notice refers to the
    class action commenced by the Tobacco Board, sets out that the regulations made
    under the<i><span style='font-style:italic'> Farm Products Marketing Act</span></i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. F-9 required that the Tobacco Board obtain the prior written
    consent of the Farm Products Marketing Commission before commencing any civil
    proceeding, and then claims that “[b]oth the Commission and the Board are <u>Responsible
    Governments</u> within the meaning of section 7 of the Comprehensive Agreement”
    (emphasis added).</p>

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Similarly, ITCAN’s Notice of Arbitration dated June
    15, 2010 does not mention s. 15 of the Agreement at all. Rather, as set out
    above, ITCAN claims in the Notice the right to start setting off payments to
    Canada on behalf of Ontario because “[t]he amount of funds owing to Canada,
    starting on April 30, 2010, shall be reduced by the amount of monetary
    liabilities incurred by ITCAN in any way relating to, arising out of or in
    connection with the Board Action, in accordance with s. 7 of the Agreement.”
    This language specifically contemplates that ITCAN may incur monetary
    liabilities as a result of the Tobacco Board’s action, which will proceed
    regardless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>I recognize that the Notice of Arbitration does say
    that “the Board Action is a Released Claim made by a Releasing Entity or a
    Responsible Government”. I do not take this to be a claim that the Tobacco
    Board is a Releasing Entity. When the Notice is read as a whole, it is clear to
    me that ITCAN, while it uses the composite term found in s. 7, is asserting its
    position that the Board’s action is made by a “Responsible Government”, (i.e.
    an Entity claiming through or on behalf of a Releasing Entity). </p>

    ITCAN’s position is that the Tobacco Board is a Responsible Government, because
    its application in the Superior Court seeks a declaration that the Tobacco
    Board’s class action “is not a ‘Released Claim <u>by a Responsible Government</u>’
    for purposes of the Comprehensive Agreement…” (emphasis added).</p>

    between Ontario and ITCAN is whether the Tobacco Board is an “Entity claiming

    Entity itself. </p>

    the court. I do observe, however, that the Tobacco Board has not a whit of
    interest in whether or not it is found to be an “Entity claiming through or on
    behalf of a Releasing Entity”. The Tobacco Board’s interest is in obtaining the
    damages it claims in the class action it has brought on behalf of itself and
    the growers and producers. The Tobacco Board’s right to damages would be
    unaffected by a finding that it is an “Entity claiming through or on behalf of
    a Releasing Entity”. Whether or not it is such an Entity, the Tobacco Board can
    still press ahead with its class action, and if successful, can enforce any
    judgment it obtains against ITCAN. The only consequence of the Tobacco Board
    being such an Entity is that ITCAN can set off the money it pays to the Tobacco
    Board as damages against the annual payments it makes to Canada on behalf of
    Ontario.</p>

    multiple proceedings and a risk of inconsistent results. The Tobacco Board’s
    class action will proceed and be determined in the Superior Court. The Superior
    Court will determine whether ITCAN has incurred monetary liabilities to the
    Tobacco Board. The arbitrator will determine whether ITCAN can set off those
    monetary liabilities against the payments it makes to Canada on behalf of
    Ontario under the Agreement. The arbitrator will also decide whether ITCAN is
    entitled to begin paying the monies it may set off into an interest-bearing
    escrow account until the Superior Court has determined the class action. </p>

    Releasing Entity is a live issue before the arbitrator, the arbitrator’s ruling
    will not be binding on the Tobacco Board in the class proceeding. ITCAN has not
    pleaded the Release as a defence in the class action, i.e. that the Tobacco
    Board is a Releasing Entity. If it does eventually raise that defence in the

    Tobacco Board is a Releasing Entity, would be binding on Ontario and ITCAN, but
    not on the Tobacco Board. Such a decision would resolve the current dispute
    between Ontario and ITCAN, namely whether ITCAN can begin to pay the annual
    payments due to Ontario into an escrow account. As well, such a decision may
    affect disputes that might arise in the future between Ontario and ITCAN, such

    the Release of ITCAN by Ontario applies to its class action. However, no one
    puts forward that the Tobacco Board is a party to the arbitration agreement and
    must arbitrate, and so I don’t see Sharpe J.A.’s comment in <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>Dancap</span></i>, on which Goudge J.A. relies, as
    applying. The Tobacco Board did not bring the application stayed by the motion
    judge, Ontario did. The Tobacco Board’s class action will proceed and its
    rights will be determined by the court in that class action whether Ontario’s
    application is stayed or whether the arbitrator proceeds. Consequently, the Tobacco
    Board does not require that Ontario’s application proceed in order to have the
    court decide its interests. The extraordinary step of declining to stay
    Ontario’s action is not necessary to protect the Tobacco Board’s rights. </p>

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>The fact that a preliminary view of the issue, on a
    cursory review of the record, makes it doubtful the arbitrator could find the
    Tobacco Board to be a Releasing Entity lends additional reason for staying
    Ontario’s application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[99]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>I add a couple of further observations. First,
    declining to stay Ontario’s application does not necessarily lead to greater
    efficiency. Because the Agreement, as Goudge J.A. agrees, must be interpreted
    in the light of the factual matrix in which it was negotiated, the court
    hearing Ontario’s application will have to admit evidence of that factual
    matrix. Since allowing Ontario’s application to proceed does not prevent the
    arbitration from proceeding, the parties may have to call evidence about the
    factual matrix in two separate proceedings. As I see it, it would be more
    efficient to stay Ontario’s application, recognizing that the issues between
    Ontario and ITCAN will be resolved by arbitration as they agreed, and awaiting
    the determination of the Tobacco Board’s rights in the class action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Second, I note that the parties provided that the
    federal <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Commercial Arbitration Act</span></i> applies to arbitrations under their Agreement, and chose the Federal Court as
    the forum in which applications to name an arbitrator must be brought. The
    approach my colleague takes opens the door to any of the courts in the home
    jurisdiction of any of the many parties to the Agreement to assert the right to
    make binding interpretations of the Agreement. </p>

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Finally, I express my view that permitting parties
    to bring applications such as Ontario’s to court would not be best for the
    arbitration system.  As Kerans J.A. observed in <i><span style='font-style:
italic'>Kaverit Steel </span></i>and as is manifest in the international
    jurisprudence, modern commercial disputes involve many parties. Allowing parties
    to resort to the court system in the face of an arbitration agreement simply by
    including in the proceeding non-parties to the agreement will provide
    encouragement for others who seek to evade their arbitration agreement. Such an
    approach will not only diminish the competence-competence principle but will result
    in added cost, complexity and delay to the arbitration process.</p>

    the court retaining jurisdiction over the matter. No such exceptions exist in
    this case. T<a name="_GoBack"></a>he challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction

    its class action against ITCAN. The Tobacco Board is a corporation without
    share capital established by regulation under the <i><span style='font-style:

    into annual agreements with tobacco manufacturers including ITCAN which, among
    other things, set the prices paid by ITCAN to tobacco growers for the tobacco
    they sold to ITCAN. The Tobacco Board’s class action is brought on behalf of
    tobacco growers against ITCAN claiming $50,000,000 damages because ITCAN paid
    less than contract prices to the growers for their tobacco. Ontario is not a
    party to the class action and will not receive any of the amounts claimed
    therein if the action is successful.</p>

    pay into escrow the funds then or thereafter due to Ontario under the
    Agreement, up to $50,000,000, pending resolution of the class action. The

    in the application, the question is whether the Tobacco Board’s claim in the
    class action is a Released Claim by a Responsible Government for the purposes
    of the Agreement. Because of the definition of “Released Claim” in the
    Agreement, this requires scrutiny of whether the claim in the class action is a
    civil claim allowable to a Releasing Entity, namely the Tobacco Board. It also
    requires scrutiny of whether the Tobacco Board is a Responsible Government. And
    both analyses must be done for the purposes of the entire Agreement.</p>

    question before the court that ITCAN says is subject to arbitration can be

    behalf of a Releasing Entity. Nor do I agree that it can be confined to the

    then and thereafter due to the credit of Ontario up to the maximum of
    $50,000,000. Those funds would remain in escrow until the Tobacco Board’s

    the event that a proceeding, claim, action, suit or complaint with respect to a

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>As applied to the present circumstances, if the

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>In summary, the answer to the question raised in
    the application has the consequence, for the purposes of s. 15, of determining
    whether, in the circumstances, ITCAN has a complete defence to the Tobacco
    Board’s action. The Tobacco Board has a significant stake in that question. </p>

size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>I now turn to the challenges to the arbitrator’s
    jurisdiction raised by Ontario and the Tobacco Board in response to ITCAN’s
    motion to stay the application because the question raised for the court is
    subject to arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[132]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>My colleague deals first with Ontario’s challenge
    that the arbitration provisions of the Agreement apply only to disputes between
    ITCAN and Canada. Ontario says these provisions do not apply at all to disputes
    between ITCAN and Ontario. It argues that the arbitrator therefore has no
    jurisdiction to decide the question raised by the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[133]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>For the reasons given by my colleague, I agree that
    this argument fails. I agree with him that the argument that a party is not
    subject to the arbitration provisions of the Agreement is simply one species of
    challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction. In this case, the argument raises a
    question of mixed fact and law, namely whether in light of the factual matrix
    in which the arbitration provisions of the Agreement were negotiated, these
    provisions extend to disputes between Ontario and ITCAN. Determining the
    necessary facts cannot be done on the basis only of a superficial consideration
    of the documentary evidence in the record. This challenge to the jurisdiction
    of the arbitrator must be addressed first by the arbitrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[134]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Ontario also challenges the jurisdiction of the
    arbitrator to decide the question posed to the court because it says the
    dispute set out in the application does not fall within the arbitration
    provisions of the Agreement. Ontario argues that the Agreement requires that
    the question in the application, posed for s. 7 purposes, be answered by the
    same forum as is required when it is posed in the s. 15 context, namely the
    court rather than arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[135]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Finally, Ontario challenges the arbitrator’s
    jurisdiction because it says two parties to the legal proceeding, namely
    Ontario and the Tobacco Board, are not parties to the arbitration provisions of
    the Agreement. The Tobacco Board joins in this challenge on the basis that it
    is a party to the legal proceeding, has a vital interest in the question before
    the court, but is not a party to the Agreement or its arbitration provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[136]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>In my view, these remaining challenges must be
    analysed separately, first in the context of s. 7 of the Agreement and then in
    the context of s. 15, to determine if the challenges must be dealt with first
    by the arbitrator or whether the application can proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[137]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>First section 7. Ontario’s challenge based on the
    nature of the dispute is that the Agreement requires that the question of
    whether the claim in the class action is a Released Claim by a Responsible
    Government must be answered for s. 7 purposes in the same forum as for s. 15
    purposes. That is clearly a question of mixed fact and law. A determination of
    the factual matrix in which the Agreement was negotiated is clearly required. A
    superficial consideration of the documentary evidence is not enough. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[138]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Turning to the challenge based on not being parties
    to the arbitration provisions, the question raised in the application, when
    posed in the s. 7 context, affects only Ontario and ITCAN. Whether the Tobacco
    Board is a party to the arbitration provisions in the Agreement is irrelevant
    to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction over the question posed in the s. 7 context.
    In addition, as I have indicated, whether Ontario is a party to the arbitration
    provisions of the Agreement is an issue that must be dealt with first by the
    arbitrator. This is so just as much so for the question raised in the
    application for s. 7 purposes as it is for the question of whether Ontario is a
    party to the arbitration provisions at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[139]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>In summary, I would conclude that, for the purposes
    of s. 7, the challenges to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to resolve the
    question raised in the application must fail. To that extent the application
    was properly stayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[140]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>However, I reach a different conclusion when the
    context is changed to s. 15. I need deal with no more than the challenge to the
    arbitrator’s jurisdiction raised by both Ontario and the Tobacco Board, that
    the Tobacco Board is not a party to the Agreement or its arbitration
    provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[141]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>As was said in <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Dancap</span></i>,
    where it is clear that a party to the legal proceedings is not a party to the
    arbitration agreement, the court can reach a final determination rather than
    require that the arbitrator first determine a jurisdictional challenge brought
    on that basis. In the language of <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Dell</span></i>,
    when no more than a superficial examination of the documentary evidence is
    required to determine this challenge, the court can do so rather than require
    the arbitrator to do so first.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[142]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Here, no one contends that the Tobacco Board is a
    party to the Agreement and its arbitration provisions. A superficial review of
    the record is enough to reach that conclusion. There is equally no doubt that
    the Tobacco Board is a party to the legal proceedings that ITCAN seeks to stay
    in favour in arbitration. Nor is there any doubt that the Tobacco Board has a
    vital interest in the question raised by the application, for the purposes of
    s. 15. The answer could provide ITCAN with a complete defence to its action, or
    could eliminate that possibility. The application directly implicates the
    Tobacco Board’s rights, not just those of Ontario and ITCAN. The arbitrator
    cannot resolve that question posed by the application because the Tobacco Board
    is not a party to the Agreement or its arbitration provisions. The arbitrator
    has no jurisdiction to determine the Tobacco Board’s rights. The question asked
    of the court must, for the purposes of s. 15, be determined in a forum in which
    the Tobacco Board has the right to participate. Hence the application should
    not be stayed in preference to arbitration so far as the question is posed for
    the purposes of s. 15.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[143]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>I would therefore dismiss the appeal so far as the
    application seeks the declaration for the purposes of s. 7. I would allow the
    appeal and lift the stay so far as the declaration sought is for the purposes
    of s. 15.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><font size=4
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[144]<font
size=1 face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Ontario has been only partially successful on
    appeal. The Tobacco Board succeeded in its main argument. I would therefore
    award Ontario significantly less in costs than it sought, and the Tobacco Board
    most of what it sought. Both are awarded costs on a partial indemnity basis
    fixed at $7,000 each, inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
