    Landlord took the position before the motion judge that repudiation of the

    parties of further performance, though not relieving the repudiating party from
    its liabilities for breach.   </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He
    then considered this court’s decision in <i>Place
    Concorde East Ltd. Partnership v. Shelter Corp. of Canada Ltd. </i>(2006), 270
    D.L.R. (4th) 181, in which rescission and repudiation were distinguished.  Rescission is a remedy available to an
    innocent party when the other party has made a false or misleading
    representation.  It allows the innocent
    party to treat the contract as void <i>ab
    initio</i>.  In contrast, repudiation
    occurs by words or conduct that show an intention not to be bound by the
    contract.  The consequences of
    repudiation depend on the election made by the innocent party.  The innocent party can elect to treat the
    contract as remaining in full force and effect.  In that case, both parties have the right to sue for damages for past or
    future breaches.  Alternatively, the
    innocent party can elect to accept the repudiation and the contract is
    terminated.  Each party is then
    discharged from future obligations.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge observed, based on <i>Highway Properties
    v. Kelly, Douglas &amp; Co</i>., [1971] S.C.R. 562, that the same principle
    applies in the case of repudiation of commercial leases.  He said it was particularly important in <i>CCAA </i>proceedings for the landlord to
    promptly advise which option it intends to pursue, when it receives notice of
    repudiation from a commercial tenant.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Based
    on the authorities, the motion judge was satisfied that the lease had not been
    forfeited prior to bankruptcy.  While the
    tenant had given notice of repudiation, the Landlord had not responded to the
    notice prior to bankruptcy.  Accordingly,
    the Trustee was entitled to disallow the Claim on the basis of disclaimer under
    s. 30(1)(k) of the <i>Bankruptcy and
    Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (<i>BIA</i>).</span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE #1 Did the Trustee have anything left to disclaim
    at the date of bankruptcy?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>HP
    submits that, in the <i>CCAA </i>context,
    the Repudiation Letter had the effect of ending the lease.  Thus, as of March 21, 2008 – the date
    stipulated in the Repudiation Letter and prior to the bankruptcy – Nex no
    longer had any interest in the premises.  HP says that pursuant to the terms of the Initial Order, it (as
    successor in interest to EDS) could not take any steps in respect of the
    repudiation of the lease other than to file a damages claim at the appropriate
    time.  The fact that Nex ended up a
    bankrupt and did not file a plan of compromise or arrangement in respect of the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings could not undo the
    legal relationship that existed as at the date of bankruptcy.  Accordingly, HP contends, at the date of the
    Nex bankruptcy, there was no longer a landlord/tenant relationship between EDS and
    Nex.  Rather, it was simply a
    debtor/creditor relationship.  Therefore,
    at the date of bankruptcy, there was no lease left for the Trustee to disclaim and
    it (HP) had an unsecured damages claim. </span></p>

    begin by observing that on the facts of this case, it is hard to see how this
    submission could succeed, given that EDS accepted rent payments after receipt
    of the Repudiation Letter.  But – more
    importantly – I reject the submission because it essentially asks the court to
    find that repudiation and termination are one and the same thing in a <i>CCAA </i>proceeding.  They are not.  Repudiation and termination are legally distinct acts that lead to
    significantly different legal rights and obligations for the parties.  They are not to be conflated.  </span></p>

    the motion judge observed, <i>Highway
    Properties </i>is the seminal Canadian case on repudiation of commercial
    leases.  In <i>Highway Properties</i>, a major tenant in a shopping centre repudiated
    its lease.  The landlord resumed
    possession and notified the tenant that it would be held liable for damages it
    (the landlord) suffered as a result of the repudiation.  The landlord sued for damages not only for
    the losses suffered to the date of repudiation but also for prospective losses
    resulting from the tenant’s failure to carry on business in the shopping centre
    for the full term of the lease.  At trial
    and on appeal, the courts held that the landlord could recover only for
    breaches that occurred to the date of surrender.  On further appeal to the Supreme Court, Laskin
    J., writing for a unanimous court, allowed the appeal and awarded damages as
    the landlord had sought.  </span></p>

    p. 570 of <i>Highway Properties</i>, Laskin
    J. set out three courses of action that a landlord may take when a tenant has
    repudiated the lease entirely: 1) the landlord may insist on performance and
    sue for rent or damages on the footing that the lease remains in force; 2) the landlord
    may elect to terminate the lease, retaining the right to sue for rent accrued
    due or for damages to the date of termination for previous breaches of covenant;
    or 3) the landlord may advise the tenant that it proposes to re-let the
    property on the tenant’s account and enter into possession on that basis.</span></p>

    as <i>Highway Properties </i>makes clear,
    termination and repudiation are distinct legal concepts.  To terminate a lease is to bring it to an
    end.  Repudiation of a lease, on the
    other hand, does not in itself bring the lease to an end.  Repudiation occurs when one party indicates,
    by words or conduct, that they no longer intend to honour their obligations
    when they fall due in the future.  It confers
    on the innocent party a right of election to, among other things, treat the lease
    as at an end, thereby relieving the parties of further performance, though not
    relieving the repudiating party from its liabilities for breach.    </span></p>

    the repudiation and notification of the acceptance, the lease will be treated

    the present case, EDS never made an election after receiving the Repudiation Letter.  It did not acknowledge or accept the
    repudiation.  Moreover, neither of the
    two alternative mechanisms provided by para. 8(c) of the Initial Order for
    dealing with repudiation was used.  It
    will be recalled that para. 8(c) gave the tenant the right to repudiate “on such
    terms as may be agreed upon” between it and EDS and Nex or, “failing such agreement,
    to deal with the consequences thereof in the Plan”.  There was no such agreement between the
    parties nor was a plan of arrangement or compromise ever filed in the <i>CCAA </i>proceeding.  </span></p>

    notwithstanding the Repudiation Letter, the relationship between EDS and Nex
    remained that of landlord and tenant at the date of the bankruptcy.  Thus, in my view, the motion judge correctly
    concluded that the lease had not been brought to an end in the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings and it was, therefore, susceptible
    to statutory disclaimer by the Trustee following the commencement of bankruptcy.  </span></p>

    submits that the motion judge erred in holding that the landlord was required
    to do something in order to make the repudiation effective.  It argues that in the context of a <i>CCAA </i>proceeding, it makes no sense for a
    landlord to do anything other than accept the notice of repudiation, locate a
    new tenant and file a damages claim.   </span></p>

    the reasons given above, I would not accept this submission.  The caselaw makes it clear that the landlord
    has an election to make when a tenant repudiates.  The landlord must make the election in order
    for the parties to know what consequences flow from the repudiation.  If the landlord does nothing, the
    landlord/tenant relationship remains and the lease continues in force: <i>Highway Properties</i>, at p. 570.    </span></p>
