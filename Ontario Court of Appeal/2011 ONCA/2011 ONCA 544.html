  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to set aside his conviction on a charge of touching
    the complainant for a sexual purpose, entered by Justice Gilmore of the
    Superior Court of Justice on July 16, 2010.  He received a sentence of 12
    months imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was a young high school teacher.  The trial judge found
    that he and the complainant  then a 15-year old grade 10 student  carried on
    a sexual relationship between December 2006 and September 2007.  Witnesses over
    the 23-day trial included the complainant, teachers, principals, students,
    police officers, the appellants common law spouse, his mother, and a
    handwriting expert.  The appellant did not testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence also included a series of MSN chat logs/emails extending
    over a lengthy period of time, as well as notes exchanged between the appellant
    and the complainant during classes that he supervised at the school.  The MSN
    messages and notes were salacious and graphic in their description of sexual
    activities between the two, both past and intended.  One final MSN chat/email
    occurred after the disclosure of the relationship; in it the appellant pleads
    for the complainant to lie about the relationship to save him and his job and
    to tell people she made it all up.  The complainant declined to do so.  The
    trial judge accurately characterized this MSN chat as darkly compelling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he raised other issues on behalf of the appellant, Mr. Rubels
    principal argument was that the trial judge  having found that certain events
    could not have occurred as described by the complainant  failed to consider
    the impact of what he called these falsehoods and impossibilities on the
    overall credibility and reliability of the complainants evidence as a whole. 
    This fed his further submissions that the trial judge misapprehended certain
    evidence and applied an uneven level of scrutiny to the assessment of the
    complainants testimony as compared to that of the defence witnesses,
    particularly, that of Ms. P. (the appellants common law spouse).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave lengthy and thorough reasons, canvassing the
    pertinent evidence of all the witnesses in detail and considering and applying
    the applicable legal factors, including those surrounding the application of
    the <i>W.D.</i> principle.  She was assiduously alive to the important
    inconsistencies and contradictions in relation to the complainants evidence
    and, as well, that of other witnesses, and addressed these issues directly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant where she found
    it to be confirmed by other independent evidence  particularly the MSN chats
    and notes referred to above, but rejected it when it did not accord with the
    objective evidence.  In doing so, she found that certain events and incidents
    could not have, or did not occur as the complainant described them.  In each
    circumstance, having done so, however, she explained why she was nonetheless
    accepting the complainants evidence that something of a sexual nature did
    happen.  While there were arguments to be made to the contrary regarding these
    circumstances, the trial judge took a different view and the record supports
    her findings on the whole.  We are not persuaded that she applied a different
    level of scrutiny to the evidence of the complainant and that of the defence
    witnesses, particularly that of Ms. P.  She was entitled on the evidence to
    draw the inferences and to make the findings she did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a reading of the trial judges reasons as a whole, we are quite
    satisfied that she was aware of the impact of her findings rejecting portions
    of the complainants testimony on the credibility and reliability of the
    complainants testimony overall, and that she applied the appropriate
    considerations in addressing and resolving the important credibility issues on
    which the trial turned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The existence of the MSN chats and the notes mentioned previously was
    established through evidence that was essentially independent of the
    complainants testimony.  This evidence was simply overwhelming in support of
    the Crowns case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was properly convicted, and the appeal is therefore
    dismissed.</p>
