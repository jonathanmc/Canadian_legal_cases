    well as his health. In January 2010, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span>,

    was amended in early May 2010 to include the parts of the reasons that detailed

    Ms. Killen <span style='color:black'>was involved in adjusting medical
    insurance claims made by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span> while
    simultaneously engaging in a personal relationship with him.  Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span> was

    application and to seek an “appropriate” publication ban on information
    respecting his personal health and any personal health care he had received.  On consent of the parties, on February 25,
    2010, Milanetti J, granted both the Star and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span> leave to intervene.  </span></span></p>

    January 2010.  She replaced them with a
    publication ban only pertaining to information concerning Mr. <span

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Reasons of the Motions Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a brief introduction, the motions judge’s
    reasons on costs can be broken down into two parts; why costs are appropriate,
    and why “full indemnity” costs are warranted.  I will provide further detail of his reasons on these two parts as I
    proceed through my analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For purposes of the first part, the motions judge noted that
    the motion regarding the publication ban touched on significant <i>Charter</i> issues of privacy and openness
    of the courts, but that the specific information sought by the Star was “not
    lofty” and was possibly prurient.  The
    Star, he found, is a business, not a non-profit interest group, and while it
    may have acted “to preserve freedom of the press and openness of the court”, it
    was also motivated by a potential economic benefit.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span>, the motions judge
    held, was entitled to protect his interests to privacy and had legal precedent
    to support doing so.  In the motions
    judge’s view, there was no reason in the circumstances of this case to depart
    from the general principle that the successful party should receive his
    costs.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As for the second part, the motions judge held that this is
    an exceptional situation for which substantial indemnity costs are usually
    reserved.  However, he then went on to
    award “full indemnity” costs.  In the
    motions judge’s opinion this was a “David and Goliath situation”, “between a
    media giant and an individual trying to protect his right to privacy ... <span
class=SpellE>fac</span>[<span class=SpellE>ing</span>] the possible publication
    of profound and unproven allegations”.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Star appeals the motions judge’s decision on
    costs and advances three grounds, namely: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) the
    costs award is inconsistent with the protection provided under s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>; (ii) the costs award
    contravenes a rule of general principle; and (iii) elevated costs are not
    appropriate in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh’s</span> position is essentially that
    the Star demonstrated a callous disregard for the highly sensitive personal
    health interests of an emotionally fragile person, and should not be insulated
    from its conduct.  He submits that the
    law's requirement of an &quot;obvious&quot; case in which there are
    &quot;strong grounds&quot; to interfere with an order as to costs, has not been
    met.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;'>I would dismiss grounds one and two
    advanced by the Star, but I would give effect to the third ground.  While I believe the motions judge erred in
    awarding full indemnity costs, I find that it was a proper exercise of his
    discretion to award costs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Contrary to the Star’s assertions, I do not think the
    specific facts of this case provide a compelling argument that the costs award <span
class=Prompt><span style='color:black'>undermines the open court principle by
    deterring the media from fulfilling its important constitutional role in
    protecting open courts.</span></span></span></p>

style='color:black'>I begin by observing that the Star does not <i>per se</i> argue a violation of s. 2(b) of
    the <i>Charter</i>; rather, it relies on the
    section as evidence of the constitutionally important role of the media in
    protecting Canada’s open courts doctrine.  The essence of the argument is that to punish the Star with costs – as
    was done here – is not only inconsistent with the media’s <i>Charter</i>-protected role, but puts a chill on it: it discourages the
    media from protecting the open court doctrine.</span></span></p>

    dismissing the Star’s motion regarding costs, the motions judge, at para. 10, </span></span><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What was at stake in terms of what was going to be

    view was that t</span>he Star was not compelled to resist the application of
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span>.  That may be true; however, it was nevertheless lawfully entitled <span
style='color:black'>to advance and argue the constitutional principles underlying
    the intervention.  The Star was properly
    responding to an order obtained <i>ex parte</i> by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span>, which effectively closed the court
    to the public.  It did nothing wrong and
    was within its rights to do so.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>At the same time, however,
    the motions judge also found that the Star was additionally motivated by
    business interests, which was open to him on the record.  The nature of the information Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span> sought to protect was very personal and had little
    public importance in regards to keeping the courts open.</span></p>

    the information at stake, weighed against the public interest in the openness
    of courts together with a financial interest.  These competing interests, in these circumstances, do not necessarily
    insulate either of the parties from a costs order. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%;color:black'>In this case
    both parties intervened in the litigation for legitimate purposes as is
    indicated by the fact they were each granted the necessary leave to do so.  Indeed, the motions judge recognizes the legitimacy
    of the interventions where, at para. 18 he notes, “</span></span>Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span>, like the Star, was entitled to protest his
    interests”.  Accordingly, t<span
class=Prompt><span style='line-height:200%;

    awarded costs, nor are costs awarded against them.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='line-height:200%;color:black'>The Star argues
    further that there was no basis for any departure from this general rule.  On the contrary, the Star claims that given
    the fact that both the affected parties are interveners, the court should apply
    the general principle that no costs should be awarded to interveners.  </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-autospace:none'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the immediate case, both the Star and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span> were joined as interveners, but the nature of
    their involvement is not in the typical context. As such the references to more
    typical interveners on this appeal are not determinative.  Even so, the Star, as I have mentioned,
    argues that the normal rule for interveners in public interest litigation
    should apply – that is, that interveners neither receive nor pay costs.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it does appear that a general rule has developed
    where interveners are neither awarded costs nor ordered to pay them, exceptions
    have been made.  For example, in <span
class=SpellE><i>Lavigne</i></span><i> v. O.P.S.E.U. </i>(1989), 67 O.R. (2d) 536,
    which included in part a constitutional challenge to a section of the <i>Colleges Collective Bargaining Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1980, C. 74, the Court of Appeal for Ontario awarded costs to several
    interveners: p. 576.  In ordering costs to
    interveners, a judge exercises discretion and is owed deference by this
    court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, while the Star was entitled to take the position
    that there was a public interest element to its intervention to preserve
    freedom of the press and openness of the court, it was also intervening to
    advance its own interest in publishing the protected information.  As the motions judge found it was also
    motivated by business interests, a finding that was open to him on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties in this proceeding were entitled to use
    legal proceedings to protect their interests or advance public interest
    obligations and to ask for costs, especially if successful.  I would therefore not interfere with the
    motions judge’s exercise of his discretion to order costs in the circumstances
    of this case. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Did the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    determining the extent of a costs award, the ordinary rule is that the
    successful litigant is entitled to his or her costs.  However, while awarding costs is a
    discretionary exercise, attracting a high level of deference, awards must be
    given on a principled basis.  While I
    accept that the motions judge was entitled to exercise his discretion and order
    costs, I do not accept that he did so on a proper basis.  Accordingly, his decision is not entitled to
    deference and this court can intervene: </span><i>Davies v. Clarington (Municipality) </i>(2009), 100 O.R. (3d) 66 (Ont.
    C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I begin by noting that it is not entirely clear
    from the motions judge’s decision whether he intended to award costs on a
    substantial indemnity or full indemnity scale.  At paras. 19 and 20 he notes that this is an exceptional case that calls
    for substantial indemnity, but goes on to award full indemnity costs.  In any event, <span class=Prompt><span
style='color:black'>I believe he erred in three respects in awarding elevated
    costs: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) he made no findings of misconduct; (ii) he
    relied on the relative resources of the parties; and (iii) he </span></span>awarded
    costs for steps taken by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span> which should
    not be the responsibility of the Star.  </p>

    court at para. 31 of <i>Clarington</i> reaffirmed the principle </span></span><span style='color:black'>that elevated
    costs are warranted in only two circumstances.  First, where there is an offer to settle under rule 49.10 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, which has no
    application in this case.  Second, on a
    clear finding of reprehensible conduct on the part of the party against which
    the cost award is being made.  </span></p>

class=Prompt><span style='color:black'>t seems to me that the motions judge was
    primarily motivated by his unfavourable view of the Star’s claims and his

    later, a<span class=Prompt><span style='color:black'>t</span></span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'> para. 19 he
    justifies his ultimate order with these remarks:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Substantial indemnity costs are usually reserved
    for exceptional situations.&nbsp; This situation, between a media giant and an

    information about Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fraleigh</span> does not amount to
    conduct worthy of sanction by the courts. <span class=Prompt><span
style='color:black'> Second, the relative
    resources of litigants is not relevant in determining a costs award except
