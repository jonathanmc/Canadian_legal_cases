  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 26, 2009, after a five-day judge-alone trial, the appellant
    was convicted of ten offences – five counts of assault, two counts of assault
    causing bodily harm, two counts of sexual assault and one count of uttering a
    threat.   On April 28, 2009, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment on
    each count, with each sentence running concurrently.  He appeals his convictions
    and, if leave is granted, the sentences imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Smith was charged with 13 offences arising out of his relationships
    with three long-term partners, B.L.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    D.Q. and M.O.  These relationships spanned the period from 1977 to 2006.  In
    2006, B.L. went to the police and reported nine years of continuous verbal,
    physical, financial and sexual abuse by the appellant.  As a result of B.L.’s
    report, the police contacted the appellant’s two previous partners, D.Q. and
    M.O., each of whom described similar abuse during their relationships with Mr.
    Smith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The grounds upon which the appellant challenges the convictions are
    primarily evidentiary, although he also submits that the trial judge erred in
    law by finding him guilty of threatening to kill D.Q. and in reversing the
    burden of proof in relation to two counts arising out of his relationship with
    M.O.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal in relation to counts one, two, four, five,
    six, seven and eight, the counts that pertain to the appellant’s relationship
    with B.L., on the basis that the trial judge erred by relying on information
    not in evidence to support his acceptance of B.L.’s version of the events where
    the credibility of B.L.’s trial testimony was critical to the Crown’s case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal in relation to
    the remainder of the counts, namely, counts nine, ten and 12.  I would,
    however, grant leave to appeal sentence and vary the sentences imposed on the
    remaining counts.</p>

    events reported by B.L. – counts one through eight</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B.L. and the appellant were together from 1995 to 2006.  B.L. testified
    that the violence, consisting of verbal, physical and sexual abuse, started
    about two years into their relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count one, a charge of common assault, related to an incident that took
    place on March 26, 2006, the day the relationship between B.L. and the
    appellant ended.  In her trial testimony, B.L. described a lengthy dispute
    between her and the appellant that day, during which the appellant hit her on
    the knuckles with a telephone when she tried to phone the police and stood on her
    toes to prevent her from leaving the house where they lived. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he and B.L. did argue that day but his
    description of events differed from that of B.L.  Significantly, the appellant
    denied that he assaulted B.L. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count two, another common assault charge, related to allegations that
    the appellant, angry that the washing machine was not working, elbowed B.L. in
    the ribs.  B.L. testified that, as a result, she swung at him but missed, hit a
    wardrobe and bruised her hand.  The appellant then pushed her down on the bed,
    jumped on her, and repeatedly hit her on the back of the head as she lay face
    down.  He also pulled her hair.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant described the difficulty with the washing machine and
    B.L’s having hit the wardrobe and bruised her hand, but denied the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count three, assault with a weapon, related to allegations that the
    appellant hit B.L. with a chair.  B.L. testified that she had bruises and marks
    on her back for a couple of weeks following the incident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant denied the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count four, assault causing bodily harm, related to allegations that,
    during an argument in which B.L. said she was going to the police, the
    appellant grabbed the purse she was holding and jerked her onto the ground.  As
    a result, B.L. sustained bruising to the inside of her arm from her elbow up to
    her underarm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, the appellant denied the assault.  He testified that B.L.
    received the bruises from an incident with a horse on their hobby farm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count five, common assault, related to allegations that, during an
    argument, the appellant chased B.L. down the hall into the bedroom and, as she
    lay on the bed face down, he punched her repeatedly with full force on the back
    of the head.  B.L. testified that she had severe headaches and wet the bed for
    about a week after the incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant remembered the bed wetting but denied the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count six, assault causing bodily harm, related to allegations that the
    appellant hit B.L. in the back and knocked her to the ground as a result of
    which she injured her knee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant denied the assault and testified that B.L. hurt her knee
    when she knelt on a toy at her son’s house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count seven, sexual assault, related to allegations that, on several
    occasions, the appellant forced B.L. to have oral sex.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that B.L. never performed oral sex due to a condition
    with her jaw, a gag and a bite reflex.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count eight was a catch-all charge of common assault that related to
    multiple incidents between 1997 and 2006. B.L. described these incidents as
    including slapping, pushing and hair pulling.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant denied the assaults, although he did agree that during
    their relationship they often argued and swore at each other.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>           (ii)       The
    event reported by D.Q. – count nine</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and D.Q. were in a relationship between 1987 and 1994.  Prior
    to the conduct in issue in the charges before the trial judge, the couple had a
    history of domestic violence.  In 1993, the appellant pleaded guilty to an
    assault that took place in 1991.  The appellant testified that the conviction
    arose from an incident in which he tried to restrain D.Q. in an attempt to
    prevent her from running away, as she had threatened to commit suicide by
    crashing into a truck on Highway 401.  He admitted that he was wrong to do so,
    but explained that he was trying to protect her from herself. There were no
    records of the 1993 assault proceedings to confirm or deny the basis upon which
    the appellant pleaded guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span

    1994, the appellant said to D.Q., “I could kill you at any moment, and no one
    would be the wiser”.  D.Q. testified that, at the time, she thought he was
    joking.  However, later she saw a hole dug in the back of their property.  The appellant
    described it to her as a test hole, related to construction taking place on the
    property. D.Q. doubted this explanation as, by that time, the construction had
    progressed to the point where there was no further need for a test hole, and
    she believed that the hole was big enough for a body.  She became fearful for
    her life and left the appellant while he was away on a trip.  D.Q. did not
    report the threat to the police until they contacted her in 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span

    whipped the back of her legs with a wire, grabbed her hair, hit her on the back
    of the head and kicked her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span

    ended her relationship with the appellant and begun a new one (with her current
    partner of 22 years at the time of the trial), the appellant called her and
    asked her to come over to help him find a receipt.  M.O. testified that after
    she found the receipt, she wanted to leave but the appellant said that first
    she had to have sex with him.  She said no, but after about an hour she gave
    in, as she believed she had no choice.  When she arrived home, M.O. told her
    partner what had happened.  </p>

    M.O. by both arms sufficiently hard that she had bruises on the inside of both
    arms above the elbows.  M.O. testified that she wore a long-sleeved wedding

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.      REASONS OF THE TRIAL
    JUDGE</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Convictions</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        The
    counts involving B.L. – counts one through eight</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the most part, the evidence relating to each count consisted of the
    testimony of B.L. and that of the appellant.  In his lengthy and detailed
    reasons, the trial judge, in convicting the appellant on counts one, two, four,
    five, six, seven and eight, reviewed the testimony of the appellant and B.L. and
    explained why he preferred that of B.L. He also considered and rejected the
    defence position that B.L. had motives to fabricate, evidenced by her <i>animus</i> toward the appellant given the “rocky” nature of their relationship, the testimony
    of L.C., a defence witness who testified that B.L. had told her she intended to
    ruin the appellant and B.L.’s 2.5 million dollar civil lawsuit against the
    appellant.  The trial judge, on his own, raised the concern that B.L. may have been
    alleging the assaults as a way of obtaining exclusive possession of the
    couple’s hobby farm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In explaining his preference for B.L.’s evidence over that of the
    appellant, the trial judge specifically noted, on a number of occasions, that
    B.L. had been consistent in the major details of her evidence throughout her
    statement to the police, the preliminary inquiry and trial.  In relation to
    counts four and six, the trial judge also made reference to supporting evidence
    such as medical records and the testimony of several witnesses who saw a large
    bruise on B.L.’s arm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In rejecting the appellant’s evidence and finding it did not raise a
    reasonable doubt, the trial judge described how he found Mr. Smith’s testimony
    to be improbable and in one instance, count six, to have been contradicted by
    that of B.L.’s son.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acquitted the appellant of count three on the basis that,
    while he accepted B.L.’s evidence that the appellant threw a chair at her and that
    the chair hit her, the trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant intended
    to hit B.L. with the chair.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       The
    count involving D.Q. – count nine</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to count nine, the trial judge found that the appellant’s
    credibility on this charge was severely damaged by his assertion that the 1993
    assault charge was prompted by an honest belief that he was holding on to D.Q.
    to prevent her from committing suicide.  The trial judge found it “totally
    unbelievable” that those facts were accepted as supporting a guilty plea to
    assault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the threatening charge, the trial judge held that the
    appellant said the words alleged by D.Q., and that although they were not taken
    seriously at the time, when considered together with the unexplained hole in the
    backyard, the words justifiably intimidated D.Q.  Further, it was a reasonable
    inference that, even without the added concern created by the hole, the words
    were intended to intimidate; a reasonable person would consider the words a
    threat.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     The
    counts involving M.O. – counts ten through 13</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge convicted the appellant on counts ten and 12 and
    acquitted the appellant on counts 11 and 13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to counts ten and 12, the trial judge accepted M.O.’s
    evidence describing it as detailed, specific and consistent.  He reasoned that
    her evidence with respect to count ten would have to be a “total fabrication”
    if the appellant’s evidence were to be believed, yet she had no motive to
    fabricate.  There was no evidence that she bore any <i>animus</i> toward the
    appellant.  She had moved on with her life. The trial judge stated that M.O.
    demonstrated candour in her testimony and that she did not attempt to “gild the
    lily”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These observations were in contrast to the trial judge’s assessment of
    the appellant’s evidence in response to M.O.’s description of the events
    pertaining to counts ten and twelve.  The trial judge described the appellant’s
    denial with respect to count ten as a “blanket denial” providing no evidence concerning
    the incidents surrounding any of the alleged assaults.  Furthermore, the trial
    judge found that the appellant’s assertions that M.O. arranged to meet him for
    consensual sex and then falsely reported rape to her partner, were incredible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge had some difficulty with M.O.’s evidence relating to
    count 11 on the basis that M.O. had dreamed of being raped by the appellant
    before waking up to find him, apparently still asleep, having intercourse with
    her.  In relation to count 13, the trial judge carefully examined the evidence
    and stated that he was “much more inclined to accept” M.O.’s evidence and that
    it “likely happened the way she described it”.  However, he found himself in
    some doubt and therefore also acquitted the appellant on count 13. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Sentences</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge began his reasons by
    reviewing the purposes of sentencing set out in s. 718 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    and specifically referring to the identification of spousal abuse as an
    aggravating factor in s. 718.2. The trial judge also emphasized the principle
    of totality, referring to it as a “huge” issue and further noting that “the
    whole concept of totality is what has been raised here, and I think that is
    highly relevant in this case.”</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of mitigation, the trial judge noted that other than the one
    previous assault conviction, for which he received a fine, the appellant
    appeared to be a law-abiding member of the community.  For three years, he had
    complied with his conditions of release.  The appellant was 56 years old and
    was being held to account for many actions that took place when he was in his
    20s.  The trial judge found that, while the appellant was a risk to women with
    whom he had an intimate relationship, that risk was decreasing with age. 
    Further, the trial judge held that there was no evidence that the appellant posed
    a risk to the community at large.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These mitigating factors notwithstanding, in response to the defence
    request for a conditional sentence, the trial judge stated that the offences
    were too serious for a sentence to be served in the community; a period of
    incarceration must be imposed.  However, he did take account of the mitigating
    factors by reducing what he identified as a fit sentence – one of four years –
    by one year, and imposed a “global sentence” of three years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The following exchange at p. 11 of his

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  So, a global sentence will be three

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MS. FERLAND: Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT: So, I will just put it on count four,
    and the others will be concurrent, so they will all be concurrent, three years.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following issues on his conviction appeal:   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to counts one, two, four, five, six, seven and eight, whether the
    trial judge erred in law by misapprehending the evidence and by relying on
    B.L.’s previous consistent statements made to the police and in her testimony
    at the preliminary inquiry to support the credibility of her trial testimony. And,
    in relation to the same counts, whether the trial judge erred by failing to
    take the evidence of L.C. into account.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to count nine, whether the trial judge erred in law by finding that
    the appellant’s utterance to D.Q. amounted to a threat to kill D.Q.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to count ten, whether the trial judge erred in misapprehending the
    appellant’s evidence in concluding that he gave only a “blanket denial”.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to counts ten and 12, whether the trial judge erred by reversing the
    onus of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the appellant’s sentence appeal is somewhat confusing.  In
    his Supplementary Notice of Appeal and in his factum, the appellant indicates
    he is appealing sentence on the basis that the trial judge erred by failing to
    impose a conditional sentence. However, in the appellant’s actual argument as
    set out in the body of his factum, he submits that his sentence appeal is
    dependent on a partially-successful conviction appeal.  Specifically, he asks
    that a conditional sentence be imposed “[i]f the appellant is successful on all
    or part of his conviction appeal”. He fails to offer any basis for varying the
    sentence if the conviction appeal is dismissed in its entirety.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>V.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Convictions</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(i)        <span
lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge err in law by misapprehending the evidence and
    by relying on B.L.’s previous consistent statements made to the police and in
    her testimony at the preliminary inquiry to support the credibility of her
    trial testimony?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As can be seen from the summary of the reasons for judgment, the Crown’s
    case was largely dependent on B.L.’s evidence at trial in which she described
    the events that supported each charge.  The appellant, in his testimony,
    disputed B.L.’s version of events.  For the most part, this was a “he said, she
    said” case.  The <span style='line-height:200%'>trial jud</span>ge’s assessment
    of B.L.’s credibility was, as I have said, critical to his determination of
    whether the Crown had proven the facts in support of each count beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that on all but one of the counts relating to
    B.L., count four, the trial judge erred in law by relying on B.L.’s initial statement
    to the police and the testimony she gave at the preliminary inquiry as support
    for preferring B.L.’s testimony over that of the appellant.  The appellant
    argues that the trial judge’s error in using B.L.’s prior statements was
    two-fold.   First, and most significantly, the statements were not part of the
    record available to the trial judge.  Secondly, the trial judge was not
    entitled to use B.L.’s prior statements, even if they were in evidence, to
    support her trial testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The portion of the reasons relating to B.L.’s allegations, over 50
    pages, contain a number of references that clearly demonstrate the importance
    the trial judge attached to the consistency between B.L.’s trial evidence and
    what she said in her extensive statement to the police and her testimony at the
    preliminary hearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To refer to just a few, the trial judge said, in relation to count one:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Another factor is, within less than an hour of
    walking down the lane, the complainant is at a police office, and that same
    afternoon gives a detailed account of this incident, and also goes back over
    eleven years of allegations. She has been consistent on all the major issues in
    her statement, through preliminary, and through trial in her evidence. It is
    not reasonable, in my view, to suggest that kind of detailed fabrication can be
    put together and consistently maintained. She was at the police station 40 to
    60 minutes after she walked off the property. I just do not think it is
    reasonably possible for her to fabricate all this detail, and not trip herself
    up.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>In relation to count five:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This allegation and her complaint is, again, first
    made on March 26, 2006, an hour and a half interview followed. It is not
    reasonably possible to fabricate this detailed account, repeated again in her
    evidence at the preliminary, and again at trial. He denies it, and I reject
    that denial. It is not going to raise as a reasonable doubt. The evidence of
    the complainant proves the allegation beyond a reasonable doubt because it is
    detailed, specific, and consistent.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Finally in relation to count eight:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Again, these allegations go back nine years. They
    were given to the police during an interview March 26, 2006 when they were
    first reported. No reasonable possibility they were all fabricated under those
    circumstances. They are consistent in detail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to the appellant’s arguments relating to the improper use of
    B.L.’s statement to the police and her testimony at the preliminary, the Crown
    submits that the trial judge relied on these previous statements only for the
    purpose of his analysis of the defence argument that B.L.’s allegations were
    fabricated.  This, argues the Crown, the trial judge was entitled to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My fundamental difficulty with this submission is that B.L.’s prior
    statements were not in evidence.  Neither the recording of the police interview
    or its transcript nor the transcript of B.L.’s evidence at the preliminary
    inquiry was tendered by counsel to form part of the trial evidence.  Both the
    preliminary inquiry and the police statement came up at various points during
    the trial and, in relation to B.L., defence counsel did read from the
    transcript of B.L.’s police statement in cross-examining B.L. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there is nothing in the record that indicates how the transcript
    of B.L.’s police statement or of the preliminary inquiry came into the
    possession of the trial judge, I can only presume that it took place informally
    as the trial proceeded.  There is certainly nothing in the transcript of the
    trial that demonstrates that either statement or a portion of either statement was
    formally tendered or admitted into evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These observations bring into focus problems that arise when proper
    attention is not paid to the boundaries of the trial evidence.  Both counsel
    and the trial judge are responsible for ensuring that there is no confusion
    about what is and what is not available to the trier of fact for the purposes
    of deciding the case.  Here, where Crown counsel wished to make use of the prior
    statements for the permissible purpose of rebutting the defence of fabrication,
    the Crown was obliged to decide first whether the entire statement or
    statements or just a portion were required, then to seek a ruling on the
    admission of what the Crown determined was necessary and finally, to ensure
    that what was admitted into evidence was limited to the information tendered
    and ruled admissible and nothing more. In some instances, for example, this may
    require redacting a portion of the page of a document to ensure that information
    not in evidence does not inadvertently become part of the record. Similarly,
    the trial judge has an obligation to monitor the admission of evidence
    carefully in order to ensure not only that the record is restricted to the material
    ruled admissible, but also that the evidence is used only for the purpose for
    which it was admitted.  see:  <i>R. v. Morrisey</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also disagree with Crown counsel’s argument that the trial judge’s
    only use of the previous statements was in considering the defence argument
    that B.L. had a motive to fabricate.  The above excerpts from the reasons for
    judgment demonstrate otherwise. They clearly indicate that the trial judge used
    the previous statements that were not in evidence, as corroborative of B.L.’s
    testimony.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Morrisey</i>, at p. 541, Doherty J.A., highlights the “fundamental
    requirement that a verdict must be based exclusively on the evidence adduced at
    trial.” In the same paragraph, Justice Doherty explains that where a trial
    judge has misapprehended the evidence, <i>including resorting to material not
    before him or her</i>, and the errors “play an essential part in the reasoning
    process resulting in a conviction then … the accused’s conviction is not based
    exclusively on the evidence and is not a “true” verdict” (emphasis added). This
    reasoning was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Lohrer</i>,
    [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, at paras. 2-3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellant has demonstrated that the convictions in
    relation to counts one, two, four, five, six, seven and eight depended on
    material not in evidence and this material played an essential part in his
    conviction of the appellant.  While the trial judge did not mention B.L’s
    previous consistent statements in his analysis of count four and the Crown’s
    case was supported by the testimony of other witnesses, reasons are to be read
    as a whole and I am not satisfied the trial judge’s conviction on count four
    was not tainted by the material not in evidence. Where a miscarriage of justice
    within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> has been
    demonstrated, the appellant does not need to show that the verdict cannot be
    supported by the evidence within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i).  It follows that,
    in relation to these counts, the convictions must be quashed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is not necessary for me to deal with the appellant’s second
    argument, namely, that the trial judge erred by failing to take into account L.C.’s
    evidence about B.L.’s motive to fabricate, I have decided, for the sake of
    completeness to do so.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept the appellant’s submission on this point. The trial
    judge did refer to L.C.’s evidence, at p. 17 of his reasons for judgment, when
    considering whether B.L. had a motive to fabricate her evidence.  Although, in
    his reasons, the trial judge did not advert directly to L.C.’s evidence about the
    toothpaste incident, it was not necessary in the circumstances since he had already
    rejected the appellant’s evidence with respect to this incident as being
    contrived and not credible. </p>

lang=EN-US>(ii)       Did the trial judge err in law by finding the appellant
    guilty of uttering threats to kill D.Q.?  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this count, there were two issues for the determination of the trial
    judge.  Did the appellant actually say the words to D.Q. and second, did they
    amount to a threat?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge not only rejected the appellant’s denial that he said
    the words, but also found that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.  This
    conclusion was based largely on the trial judge’s finding that the appellant’s
    description of the circumstances under which he pled guilty in 1993 of
    assaulting D.Q., was incredible.  Furthermore, he accepted D.Q.’s evidence that
    the appellant did say to her that he “could kill [her] at any moment, and no
    one would be the wiser”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant said those words to D.Q.
    was based on his assessment of the evidence. I see no reason to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only remaining issue is whether these words, in the circumstances in
    which they were uttered, support a conviction for uttering a death threat.  Counsel
    for the appellant submits that these words amount only to an assertion of the
    ability to kill and do not convey a present intention to kill now or in the
    future - the <i>actus reus</i> of uttering a threat to kill.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The structure and wording of s. 264.1(1)(<i>a</i>)

    &nbsp;They must be considered objectively and within the context of all the
    written words or conversation in which they occurred. As well, some thought
    must be given to the situation of the recipient of the threat.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question to be resolved may be put in the
    following way. &nbsp;<i>Looked at objectively, in the context of all the words

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span

    appellant “gave no evidence about any incidents surrounding any of these
    allegations” was contrary to the evidence as the record demonstrates that the appellant
    testified in some detail about various aspects of his relationship with M.O,
    including incidents that took place that related to some of the allegations
    that formed the basis of count ten.  Furthermore, argues the appellant, since
    he took the position that none of the assaults described by M.O. took place, it
    was unreasonable to expect him to provide detailed information about such
    events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge’s comment that the appellant gave a blanket
    denial must be read in the context of the entirety of the portion of his
    reasons dealing with count ten, in which the trial judge reviewed the
    appellant’s testimony in full, ending with his rejection of the appellant’s
    version of events and his conclusion that it did not raise a reasonable doubt. 
    In accepting M.O.’s evidence, the trial judge found that it was balanced,
    specific, detailed and consistent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no error in the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence relating

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(iv)      Did the trial judge err by reversing the onus of proof in

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to count ten, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred when he said that M.O.’s evidence would have to be a “total fabrication”
    if the appellant’s was to be believed.  The appellant only needed to raise
    reasonable doubt; he did not need to prove fabrication.  With respect to count
    12, the appellant similarly argues that the trial judge’s findings that it was
    unreasonable to believe the appellant’s testimony that M.O. would pursue the
    appellant after leaving him for a man with whom she still lives 22 years later,
    and that it defied common sense that she would falsely report a rape to her
    boyfriend, were unreasonable.  These findings, argues the appellant, show that
    the trial judge’s approach was to assume that he committed the sexual assault
    against M.O., as it was only then that his testimony would defy common sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge did not reverse the onus of proof with
    respect to count ten or count 12.  Throughout his reasons, the trial judge
    repeatedly referenced the required approach to the assessment of evidence
    established in <i>W.(D.)</i>. The trial judge was entitled to reject the
    appellant’s evidence and find that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.  With
    respect to count ten, the trial judge’s comment about fabrication was nothing
    more than a recognition of the obvious – that the appellant’s and M.O.’s
    evidence conflicted and thus could not both be true.  Similarly, with respect
    to count 12, the trial judge was entitled, on the available evidence, to make
    the findings of fact that he did. In noting that the appellant’s version of the
    events was unreasonable, the trial judge was merely explaining why that version
    did not raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Sentence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since I would allow the appeal in relation to counts one, two, four,
    five, six and eight, quash the convictions and order a new trial and dismiss
    the appeal in relation to all other counts, it is necessary to consider only
    the sentences imposed on counts nine, ten and 12.  The death threat to D.Q. and
    the assaults on M.O., including the sexual assault that forms the basis of
    count 12, must be considered separately for sentencing purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this province, sentences for uttering a death threat in circumstances
    similar to those in this case tend to range from the imposition of a suspended
    sentence to six months imprisonment: see <i>R. v. Rowe</i> (2006), 212 C.C.C.
    (3d) 254 (C.A.), <i>R. v. Bytyqi</i> (2004), 186 O.A.C. 114 (C.A.), <i>R. v.
    Stiliadis</i>, 2004 CarswellOnt 1388 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence of this court suggests that a sentence of one to two
    years will generally be appropriate for a conviction for common assault based
    on facts such as those comprising count ten, committed against a spouse or
    domestic partner in the context of a lengthy pattern of domestic abuse: see <i>R.
    v. Petrovic</i> (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 97 (C.A.), <i>R. v. Inwood</i> (1989), 32
    O.A.C. 287 (C.A.), <i>R. v. R.(B.S.)</i> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), <i>R.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in cases of sexual assault involving forced intercourse with a
    spouse or former spouse, sentences generally range from 21 months to four
    years: see <i>R. v. R.(B.S.)</i> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), <i>R. v.
    Jackson</i>, 2010 ONSC 3910, <i>R. v. M.(B.)</i>, 2008 ONCA 645, <i>R. v. Nolan</i>,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These observations take me to the question of whether the sentences I
    would impose for these crimes should be served consecutively or concurrently.  While
    the decision to impose sentences consecutively or concurrently is entitled to
    the same deference customarily afforded to sentencing decisions (<i>R. v.
    M.(T.E.)</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 46), in this case, the trial judge
    failed to offer any justification for his decision that each sentence be served
    concurrently. As such, there is no reasoning to which to defer. Given the
    length of time between the offences committed against D.Q. and against M.O.,
    the fact that they were committed against two different complainants and the
    lack of any other relevant nexus between the offences, including those in
    relation only to M.O., in my view the trial judge made a reversible error in
    deciding that the sentences should be served concurrently: see <i>R. v. W.Q. </i>(2006),
    213 O.A.C. 217 (C.A.), at para. 15, <i>R. v. Traverse</i> (2008), 231 Man R.
    (2d) 123 (C.A.), at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this juncture it is important to note that the Crown chose not to
    cross appeal sentence.  Therefore, the sentence I would impose in relation to
    the three counts that require reconsideration cannot exceed three years, in
    total.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against that background, having regard to the principles set out in s. 718
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the aggravating circumstances, the main one being
    the fact that the appellant’s acts were acts of spousal abuse, and the
    mitigating factors identified<i> </i>by the trial judge, I am of the view that
    fit sentences are two months for count nine, ten months for count ten and two
    years for count 12.  I would order the sentences for counts ten and 12 to be
    served consecutively with each other and consecutive to the sentence for count
    nine.</p>

    dismiss the appeal from the convictions on counts nine, ten and 12, grant leave
    to appeal the sentence imposed on those counts, allow the appeal and vary the
    sentences imposed on those counts to two months for count nine, ten months for
    count ten and two years for count 12, each sentence to be served consecutively

    individual offence and designate them concurrent or consecutive to fit within
    the already determined global sentence: see <i>R. v. Jewell</i> (1995), 83
    O.A.C. 81 (C.A.). The alternative approach requires a sentencing judge first to
    assign fit sentences for each offence and designate those sentences as
    concurrent or consecutive and only then, as a final step, consider the total
    sentence to ensure it does not offend the principle of totality: see <i>R. v.
