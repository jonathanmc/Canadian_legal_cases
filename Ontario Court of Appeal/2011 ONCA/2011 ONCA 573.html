  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Review Board’s November 27, 2009
    disposition ordered that the appellant be detained with a condition allowing
    him to live in the community in accommodation approved by the hospital. On July
    20, 2010 this court allowed an appeal from that disposition substituting an
    order directing that the appellant be conditionally released and remitting the
    matter to the Board to determine the appropriate conditions. When the Board
    reconvened on August 16, 2010, all parties, including the Crown, took the
    position that the only issue for the Board was to determine the conditions of
    the conditional discharge ordered by this court. The Board disagreed and stated
    that its mandate was not so limited and that it was entitled to engage in a
    broader inquiry and to consider whether there were any circumstances that
    required a change to the conditional discharge that this court had just
    ordered. The Board further held that as it was prepared to consider that wider
    issue, the appellant was not entitled to a further annual review until July
    2011.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the submission of all counsel, including
    the Crown, that the Board erred in its interpretation of this court’s July 20,
    2010 order. Section 672.78(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> gives this court the power to refer a matter back to the review board
    for a rehearing “in whole or in part, in accordance with any directions that
    the Court of Appeal considers appropriate”. The July 20, 2010 order was made
    pursuant to that power. The Board erred by, in effect, reviewing that order by
    purporting to engage in a full scale review of the appellant's situation. The
    Board’s action was not only contrary to the order made by this court; it also
    denied procedural fairness to the appellant who was not on notice that such a
    hearing would be held. Moreover the Board’s insistence that the appellant’s
    annual review be postponed to July 2011 denied the appellant the right to a
    mandatory annual review pursuant to s. 672. 81 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asks us to grant him an absolute
    discharge. We are not satisfied that the record before us is sufficient to
    grant that order. There is no updated hospital report and no current evidence
    from the appellant's treatment team as to his present situation. In the
    circumstances it is not practicable for this court to conduct the necessary
    inquiry. Moreover, as this is an appeal from the Board’s August 16, 2010
    disposition which should have been limited to the appropriate conditions, this
    appeal does not provide an appropriate vehicle to determine the issue of
    discharge. The appropriate order is to remit the matter to the Ontario Review
    Board for an immediate consideration of the appellant’s disposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly the appeal is allowed and the matter is
    referred back to a differently constituted panel of the Ontario Review Board to
    conduct a full hearing reviewing the appellant’s disposition forthwith.</p>
