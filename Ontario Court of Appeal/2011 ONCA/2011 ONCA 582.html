style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants were charged with two counts of fraud and one count of forgery. They
    were tried by a judge alone at a trial lasting 65 days.  They called no evidence. On March 25, 2009, they
    were convicted on all counts. The forgery count was subsequently stayed pursuant <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    August 5, 2009, the trial judge sentenced Drabinsky to a term of imprisonment
    of seven years and Gottlieb to a term of six years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants appeal both their convictions and their sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> On their conviction appeals, the appellants
    raise a number of arguments which, in large measure, challenge the findings of
    fact made by the trial judge.  We see no
    reversible error and would dismiss the conviction appeals.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants also seek leave to appeal their sentences and, if leave is granted,
    appeal those sentences.  We agree with
    the trial judge that substantial penitentiary terms were required for both
    appellants.  We are, however, satisfied
    that she erred in principle in failing to take into account the absence of any
    evidence of the actual financial loss occasioned by the frauds.  While financial loss is not an essential
    element of the crime of fraud, it is a significant consideration on
    sentence.  While the absence of proof of
    actual financial loss could not justify a sentence outside of the substantial
    penitentiary range, it does justify sentences that are somewhat lower within
    that range than those imposed by the trial judge.  We would vary Drabinsky’s sentence to five
    years and Gottlieb’s sentence to four years.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge delivered comprehensive reasons for conviction.  She reviewed the evidence at length and made
    detailed findings of fact.  We will refer
    to the evidence only as necessary to address the appellants’ arguments on
    appeal.  Our reasons are best read in
    conjunction with the full factual picture described by the trial judge in her
    reasons.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A:  The Rise and
    Fall</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span

    Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb established Cineplex in the 1980s.  Through it, they quickly became known in the
    movie theatre business in Canada, particularly for creating multi-screen
    theatres in attractive locations.  In
    1989 they left Cineplex, having acquired its live entertainment division, including
    the Canadian rights to Phantom of the Opera. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb formed a partnership called MyGar. Through several wholly owned
    corporate vehicles, MyGar began to build a very successful live entertainment
    business, the first of its kind in Canada.  We will refer to MyGar and its associated companies collectively as
    MyGar.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    and Drabinsky operated through MyGar until the spring of 1993.  On May 20, 1993, MyGar made a public offering
    of its shares (the “IPO”) and became a public company known as Livent.  Livent was, if not the first, among the first
    publicly traded live theatre companies. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb were large shareholders in Livent and fully controlled its
    operations and management decisions. Through their efforts, Livent became one
    of the prime movers in the entertainment industry in North America and, to a
    lesser extent, in other parts of the world.  The work of Drabinsky and Gottlieb brought both economic and cultural
    benefits to many cities, including Toronto.  Livent produced many successful musicals, plays and concerts in Toronto,
    New York and Chicago, often in historic theatres that the company renovated,
    owned, and managed.  In the words of the
    trial judge, “Mr. Drabinsky was admired as ‘one of the most innovative forces
    in the theatre.’  Together with Mr.
    Gottlieb, he ran the company.”  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Livent
    needed significant and continual infusions of cash to fund its very ambitious
    projects.  Between 1993 and 1998, it
    raised over $500 million through share offerings, special warrants, notes, bond
    issues, debentures, and bank loans.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    April 13, 1998, Drabinsky announced a significant change in the management of
    Livent.  New investors were to be brought
    in, led by Michael Ovitz, a well-known Hollywood figure.  The Ovitz group was to oversee the management
    of Livent, allowing Drabinsky to devote his time exclusively to the artistic
    and creative endeavours of the company.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Ovitz deal closed in June 1998 and the new investors put their management team
    in place. It was anticipated that their business experience, combined with the
    creative talent at Livent, would ensure the continued upward trajectory of the
    company.  However, the bright future
    anticipated when the Ovitz group arrived on the scene never materialized.  Unbeknownst to the Ovitz group, the Livent
    financial statements were fraudulent and did not reflect the true financial
    state of the company.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the summer of 1998, shortly after the new management took over, its accountants
    began to ask questions.  Several of the employees
    at Livent, who were aware of, and had participated in, the creation of the
    fraudulent statements, knew that the accountants would eventually uncover the deception.  They went to the new management team and
    exposed the fraud hoping to protect themselves by doing so.   New management immediately locked Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb out of Livent, retained litigation counsel, and went to the
    regulators in Canada and the United States.  Five months after the Ovitz deal closed, Livent declared bankruptcy.  These charges eventually followed.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Those
    acting for the Ovitz group viewed Drabinsky and Gottlieb as the persons
    responsible for the fraud.  The former
    Livent employees were engaged to assist the new management team in their
    efforts to bring the fraud home to Drabinsky and Gottlieb.  Maria Messina, the CFO at Livent who had been
    heavily involved in the creation of the fraudulent statements, went so far as
    to become an important and well paid part of the new management’s litigation
    team.  Messina and Gordon Eckstein, a
    vice-president at Livent who was in charge of the accounting department, became
    the key prosecution witnesses.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B:  The MyGar Fraud
    (Count One)</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    one alleged that the financial statements of MyGar, relied on to promote the IPO
    in 1993, were fraudulent in that they deliberately overstated the value of
    MyGar’s assets by about $6 million.  The
    Crown alleged that the misrepresentations were material to investors’
    assessments of the merits of the IPO and that the economic interests of those
    who ultimately invested in the IPO were prejudiced by the misrepresentations in
    the financial statements.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
    to the Crown’s theory, the MyGar fraud had its origin in a scheme hatched by
    Drabinsky and Gottlieb in 1990 to circumvent restrictions on the advances MyGar
    could make to them as its two shareholders.  Under MyGar’s lending agreement with its bank, advances to Drabinsky and
    Gottlieb were limited to fixed amounts.  Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb wanted to take more money out of MyGar than the arrangements with
    the bank permitted.  To do this, they entered
    into agreements with two persons whose companies did extensive construction-related
    work for MyGar.  Pursuant to these
    agreements, Drabinsky and Gottlieb, or entities controlled by them, would bill
    those companies for fictional services and create fraudulent invoices to
    support those billings.  The companies
    would pay Drabinsky and Gottlieb the amounts claimed for the non-existent
    services and then add those costs to the invoices submitted to MyGar for construction
    work actually done on the Pantages Theatre or the MyGar offices.  This was referred to in argument as “the kickback
    scheme”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under
    the kickback scheme, the payments to Drabinsky and Gottlieb, which were in reality
    advances from MyGar, were hidden under fraudulent invoices for services never
    rendered by the appellants, as well as fraudulent invoices that inflated the
    amount claimed by companies who had done work for MyGar.  Drabinsky and Gottlieb received payments totaling
    slightly over $8.1 million between 1990 and 1993. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Most
    of the payments made to Drabinsky and Gottlieb under the above-described scheme
    were disguised in MyGar’s financial statements as either fixed assets or preproduction
    costs.  Eckstein, who came to work for
    MyGar in 1990 after the kickback scheme was in place, testified that Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb made the decision to book the kickbacks as fixed assets and preproduction
    costs.  He would from time to time
    receive written instructions from Gottlieb concerning specific payments. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    payments to Drabinsky and Gottlieb should have been recorded in MyGar’s books
    as advances from MyGar to its shareholders.  If, however, as the fraudulent scheme devised by Drabinsky and Gottlieb
    represented, the entirety of the payments had been for construction work, those
    amounts could properly be booked to fixed assets and preproduction costs.  On Eckstein’s evidence, Drabinsky and
    Gottlieb instructed that the kickback payments be treated for accounting
    purposes as what they appeared to be in the fraudulent documentation.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Eckstein
    testified that before MyGar went public in the spring of 1993, he recommended
    to Drabinsky and Gottlieb that MyGar should take a $4 to $6 million write-down
    of its assets so that their inflated value, occasioned by the treatment of the fraudulent
    payments to Drabinsky and Gottlieb, would be removed from MyGar’s financial
    picture before it went public.  Eckstein
    testified that Drabinsky and Gottlieb emphatically rejected this proposal, saying
    that a write-down would “look terrible” and would interfere with the ability to
    market the IPO.  Consequently, the MyGar
    financial statements used for the IPO showed assets of $90 million, an
    overstatement of about $6 million.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants admitted that they had devised and orchestrated the kickback scheme.  They had, however, also put over $9 million back
    into MyGar during the same time period. They also submitted, correctly, that
    the kickback scheme was not the fraud charged in count one.  </span></p>

    one charged a fraud against the investors in the IPO through the misrepresentation
    of the value of MyGar’s assets in the financial statements.  Drabinsky and Gottlieb contended that they
    were unaware of that misrepresentation because they did not know that Eckstein,
    acting on his own, had disguised the payments as preproduction costs and fixed
    assets.  The appellants argued that absent
    proof of that knowledge, they could not be convicted of the fraud alleged in
    count one.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge summarized her reasons for convicting the appellants on the MyGar
    fraud as follows, at para. 487:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe that Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb
    directed that the Kofman/Execway invoices be booked to fixed assets and
    preproduction costs. They had devised all aspects of this kick-back scheme
    themselves. Mr. Kofman, Mr. Wayment and the documents establish this. Mr.
    Eckstein only found out about the scheme when he saw large invoices which had
    no real backup. It makes perfect sense that Mr. Eckstein would ask what they
    were and how to book them. I accept his evidence that he was directed by Mr.
    Gottlieb and Mr. Drabinsky to book them to fixed assets and preproduction
    costs. Whether the instructions came on a sheet or sheets of paper, I accept
    that they came to him as instructions. By allocating the expenses in this way,
    the assets of MyGar were inflated. I accept Mr. Eckstein’s evidence that he
    suggested a write down but this was refused by Mr. Gottlieb and Mr. Drabinsky.
    The assets of MyGar thus included invoices that were part of a kick-back scheme
    and so the statements were false.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C:  The Livent Fraud
    (Counts Two and Three)</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Livent fraud referred to in count two focused on
    the accounting practices employed at Livent between 1993 and 1998.  The trial judge found a consistent pattern of
    artificially reducing expenses in the company’s financial statements so that
    the reported net income would meet budget projections. She concluded that the
    appellants knew of this practice, and indeed ordered that it be done, so that
    Livent would appear to potential investors and lenders to be meeting its
    financial expectations.  By creating a
    false impression of its net income, Livent was in a better position to attract new
    funding from various sources.  That new
    funding was essential if Livent was to continue to grow and realize the dream
    of its founders that it become the premier live theatre company in the world.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that a variety of accounting techniques
    were used to fraudulently reduce expenses and thereby increase net income.  These included deferring operating costs from
    the accounting period in which they were actually incurred to future accounting
    periods, transferring expenses properly associated with one project to another
    project, and improperly transferring operating and preproduction costs to fixed
    asset accounts relating to theatre construction.  The relevant backup documentation was
    routinely altered to give apparent validity to the accounting
    representations.  Indeed, the employees
    at Livent went so far as to modify accounting software to facilitate after-the-fact
    falsification of the documentation underlying the transactions that were fraudulently
    reflected in the accounting statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the fraudulent practices
    described above were a matter of routine at Livent and reflected “[t]he culture
    of cheating” begun at MyGar and continued with a vengeance at Livent (para.
    454).  The trial judge held that the
    culture was fully understood by the employees at Livent who went so far as to
    joke about going to jail for what they were doing.  On her findings, Drabinsky and Gottlieb were
    at the centre of that culture.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants acknowledged that Livent’s financial
    statements contained fraudulent misrepresentations.  They argued, however, that it was not the
    accounting practices that were fraudulent, but rather the falsification of the
    backup documentation underlying the accounting statements.  The appellants maintained that the accounting
    personnel at Livent, primarily Eckstein, initiated and engaged in the falsification
    of the underlying documentation on their own initiative and without any
    direction from, or knowledge of, either Drabinsky or Gottlieb.  The appellants submitted that while the
    accounting treatment of various expenses at Livent might be described as
    “aggressive”, there was nothing fraudulent about it.  They submitted that Eckstein, because of his
    arrogance, incompetence and personal dishonesty, unilaterally and unnecessarily
    directed the falsification of documents to create justifications for the
    accounting treatment of various expenditures in the financial statements of
    Livent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appreciated that it was not the use of
    specific accounting practices that constituted the fraud, but rather the
    arbitrary and unjustified use of those practices to achieve net income levels
    that reflected the projected ones.  She
    said, at para. 427:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence submits that expert evidence was
    necessary to establish that the individual entries were justifiable. On a
    line-by-line analysis, some of the entries could be justified. What cannot be
    justified is the accounting system in place that arbitrarily moved numbers in
    order to reduce expenses and increase profits. <u>Thus, even if some of the
    entries were justifiable, the cumulative effect of the manipulations is not.
    All the employees who made the manipulations spoke about the arbitrary nature
    of the adjustments and that the goal was to get income closer to budget.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in her reasons after setting out the law of
    fraud, the trial judge succinctly stated her ultimate finding of fact, at paras.
    499 and 502-503:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>They [Drabinsky and Gottlieb] knew and directed the
    accounting practices in order to keep the investment funds coming in.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. <span class=term1>Drabinsky</span> and Mr.
    Gottlieb were so devoted to the continuation of Livent that they directed the
    falsification of the financial statements in order to continue the flow of
    money to the company.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
    Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb initiated the improper accounting system and knew of
    its continuation throughout the years 1994-1998. The actions of Mr. Drabinsky
    and Mr. Gottlieb satisfy all three of the ways a prohibited act can be
    conducted: they were deceitful, they perpetrated a falsehood and reasonable
    people would consider them dishonest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The forgery charge (count three) stemmed from the same
    delict as the Livent fraud, namely the falsification of Livent’s financial
    statements. The appellants signed the statements provided to auditors, the board
    of directors, and the public.  On the
    trial judge’s findings, the appellants knew these statements were false and
    intended that they be relied on as genuine.  The forgery count was stayed after the conviction on the Livent fraud
    charge.  Since we would uphold the fraud
    convictions, we need not examine the forgery count in any detail.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CONVICTION APPEALS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are numerous grounds of appeal.  Some globally challenge all of the
    convictions, others are limited to the conviction on count one (MyGar fraud) and
    others challenge the convictions on counts two and three (Livent fraud).  Most of the grounds of appeal apply to both
    appellants, but some apply only to Gottlieb.  Before addressing the specific grounds of appeal, we will address those
    grounds at large and place them in the context of the conduct of the trial and
    the trial judge’s reasons.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A:  Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial was lengthy and hard fought.  Some of the evidence was complicated.  The important witnesses testified for
    days.  Lead counsel for the appellants, both
    among Canada’s preeminent criminal counsel, left no stone unturned in
    challenging the Crown’s case.  However,
    in the end, the verdicts turned largely on two factual issues – were the
    appellants aware of the admittedly false statements made in the financial
    statements of MyGar and Livent? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied heavily on the evidence of Livent
    employees, particularly Eckstein and Messina.  All of the employees were implicated to some degree in the frauds.  Eckstein and Messina were heavily involved.  There were many reasons to question the
    credibility and the reliability of their testimony implicating the appellants,
    not the least of which was their obvious and powerful self-interest in
    assisting the prosecution.   Eckstein had
    pleaded guilty in exchange for a non-custodial sentence and Messina had avoided
    prosecution altogether.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown acknowledged that the witnesses, particularly
    Eckstein and Messina, fell within the “unsavoury witness” category and that
    their evidence required careful scrutiny.  The Crown submitted, however, that their testimony was supported by
    documentary evidence and the testimony of other witnesses.  On a more general level, the Crown argued
    that it made no sense to suggest that Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who were very knowledgeable
    about financial matters and very “hands on” in their management and control of the
    day-to-day affairs of MyGar and Livent, could somehow be unaware for years of the
    ongoing rampant fraudulent activity at those companies.  The Crown further submitted that Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb each had a strong motive.  They
    were the most obvious and direct beneficiaries of the fraudulent activity
    because of their strong financial, personal and professional interest in MyGar
    and Livent.  They personified the
    companies and the companies’ success was their success. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence, built primarily through cross-examination
    of the Crown witnesses, was essentially two-fold.  First, the appellants argued that the main
    Crown witnesses were entirely incredible for a variety of reasons, including
    their strong vested interest in assisting the prosecution to protect themselves
    from the consequences of their criminal activity.  Second, the defence pointed to four
    unchallenged facts, which they argued, taken either individually or
    cumulatively, raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellants had the
    requisite guilty state of mind.  The
    defence referred to these as the “four pillars of reasonable doubt”.  We will address those pillars when
    considering specific grounds of appeal.  It is sufficient to say at this point that the defence alleged that each
    factual pillar justified inferences that were inconsistent with the Crown’s
    claim that Drabinsky and Gottlieb had knowledge of the fraudulent activities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons demonstrate a firm grasp of
    the evidence, the issues raised, and the positions of the parties.  She was aware that the question of the
    appellants’ knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the financial statements lay
    at the heart of the case.  The trial
    judge analyzed each of the four pillars in some detail (paras. 434-450), but
    ultimately concluded, for the reasons she articulated, that none gave rise to a
    reasonable doubt as to Drabinsky’s and Gottlieb’s knowledge of the fraudulent
    nature of Livent’s financial statements.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was also alive to the credibility
    concerns raised in connection with the various Crown witnesses.  She closely examined the evidence of all of
    the witnesses and the defence submissions that their evidence should be
    rejected.  She did not make global
    assessments of credibility and reliability but instead, as required, addressed
    the evidence of the various witnesses as it related to specific events and issues.  The trial judge rejected some of the evidence
    offered by the main Crown witnesses as incredible or unreliable and accepted
    other parts of that evidence.  Her
    careful review of the credibility and reliability concerns raised by the
    defence is particularly evident in her painstaking examination of the evidence
    of Eckstein and Messina.  Ultimately, the
    trial judge rejected the defence arguments that these witnesses were totally
    incredible.  She accepted significant
    parts of their evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, this court has jurisdiction to review findings
    of fact and credibility:  s. 686(1)(a)(i).  That jurisdiction is, however, limited.  This court cannot retry the case and substitute
    its opinion of the credibility of witnesses and the force to be given to
    fact-based arguments for the assessments made by the trial judge:  <i>R. v.
    W.(R.)</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122; <i>R. v.
    Beaudry</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellants appreciate the significant limitations
    on fact-based appeals.  They have framed their
    arguments in appellate review-friendly language, alleging various misapprehensions
    of the evidence, failures to consider relevant evidence, and failures to properly
    apply fundamental legal principles such as the presumption of innocence.  However, stripped to their essentials, many
    of counsel’s submissions invite and depend on a <i>de novo</i> evaluation of factual arguments raised at trial and considered
    and rejected by the trial judge in her reasons.  Despite the language used to frame the submissions, many are, in reality,
    attempts to resurrect and reargue factual battles fought and lost at trial.  Those arguments cannot succeed in this
    court.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, counsel for Drabinsky attack the trial
    judge’s rejection of the claim that the firing of Robert Topol was inconsistent
    with the defence assertion that Drabinsky and Gottlieb were unaware of the
    ongoing falsification of the accounting statements and records at Livent.  This was one of the “four pillars of
    reasonable doubt” referred to above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Topol was a senior officer and director at Livent.  The Crown claimed that he was aware of, and
    participated in, the Livent fraud.  He
    was originally charged with fraud, but those charges were dropped.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1998, Gottlieb learned that Topol had improperly
    sold certain Livent shares.  Gottlieb pressed
    Drabinsky to fire Topol.  Eventually,
    Topol left Livent.  It is fair to say
    that he was forced out of Livent by Drabinsky and Gottlieb.  The defence contended that the firing of a
    person who, according to the Crown, could implicate them in a massive fraud was
    inconsistent with Drabinsky’s and Gottlieb’s knowledge of an ongoing fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Drabinsky’s factum, counsel spend five pages explaining
    why the removal of Topol was inconsistent with Drabinsky’s and Gottlieb’s
    knowledge of the ongoing fraud.  In the
    course of a detailed analysis of the evidence, counsel refers to the trial
    judge “misapprehending” evidence and “failing to appreciate” the significance
    of evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alleged misapprehension of evidence flows from the
    trial judge’s finding that Topol was leaving Livent in any event (para.
    448).  In fact, the evidence supports
    that observation, although there was some question as to when he would leave
    before the controversy arose over his sale of the shares.  In any event, the trial judge’s finding that
    the evidence concerning Topol’s dismissal did not give rise to a doubt as to
    the appellants’ knowledge of the fraud was not based on the timing of his
    departure.  She decided that because
    Topol himself was heavily involved in the fraud, the appellants need not fear
    Topol’s exposure of the fraud.  This
    inference was a reasonable one that was open to the trial judge and is not
    based on any misapprehension of the evidence or failure to appreciate the
    significance of evidence.  The defence submissions
    concerning the removal of Topol, like others advanced in this appeal, come down
    to the assertion that the trial judge should have accepted the argument they
    made.  That submission cannot succeed on
    appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the above overview in mind, we turn to some of the
    specific grounds of appeal.  They fall
    into four categories:</p>

    provide only a summary of the evidence and the positions of the parties,
    followed by a series of bald, conclusory statements leading to the verdicts.  Counsel argue that the reasons do not demonstrate
    that the trial judge appreciated the central issues in the trial and do not reveal
    the analysis of those issues that eventually led to the verdicts:  see <i>R.

    to the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence concerning the accounting
    practices used at Livent.  They say that
    the reasons do not demonstrate that the trial judge appreciated the distinction
    between legitimate accounting practices, such as “expense rolls”, and the
    fraudulent misuse of those techniques.  They
    argue that the reasons suggest that the trial judge moved directly from a
    finding that certain accounting practices were used, to the conclusion that the
    appellants were not only aware of those practices, but appreciated that they
    were being used to create a fraudulent picture of Livent’s financial
    status.  </span></p>

    defence contention that there was nothing inherently wrong with the various
    accounting techniques described in the evidence (paras. 312-316).  She clearly accepted that the accounting
    techniques were not inherently fraudulent.  The trial judge went on, however, to find, based primarily on the
    evidence of Eckstein, which she accepted after a detailed review, that the
    accounting techniques were used to achieve projected net income levels by
    arbitrarily allocating various expenditures to reduce expenses and thereby
    increase net income.  She found, at
    paras. 360-361:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe that Mr. Eckstein gave the management
    summaries to Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb and discussed the documents with
    them at management meetings. The documents were discussed in detail and, as
    time went on the nature of the directions to Mr. Eckstein evolved. <u>It
    started with specifics and then became a direction to simply come up with the
    numbers that would match budget.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb were part of the
    decision and the direction to Mr. Eckstein that began this accounting system,
    the object of which was to get the numbers close to budget. As time went on and

    have been aware of the mechanisms by which the staff was implementing the
    adjustments. They may not have known about the computer programme change. They
    did not even know how to work a computer. <u>However, they knew that improper

    trial judge’s reasons plainly show that she understood the evidence and the
    defence position.  They further indicate
    that she appreciated that the essence of the Livent fraud allegations lay not
    in the accounting techniques used, but in the use of those techniques to obtain
    a desired projected net income figure instead of reflecting the reality of
    Livent’s financial condition.  That finding
    was central to her verdict on counts two and three and is fully explained and

    representations in the financial statements.  The trial judge’s reasons reflect the nature of the case presented and
    argued before her.  They canvass the

    the trial record for evidence confirmatory of Eckstein’s testimony on count
    one.  They argue that there was no evidence

    book the payments in the financial records of MyGar and no evidence confirming
    his testimony that Drabinsky and Gottlieb refused to take a write-down on the

    count one.  First, there was the
    appellants’ admitted role as the instigators, architects and beneficiaries of
    the kickback scheme.  It was that scheme
    that gave rise to the need to record those payments in a manner that would
    conceal their true nature.  Second, the
    booking of the payments to preproduction costs and fixed assets was consistent
    with the fraudulent scheme devised by the appellants.  The payments were misrepresented as costs
    associated with construction, project management and interior retrofits.  Those costs, had they actually been incurred,
    would have properly been booked to preproduction costs and fixed assets.  </span></p>

    our view, even without Eckstein’s testimony, it could fairly be inferred that
    Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who created the kickback scheme and who were in
    complete control of MyGar, determined how the improper payments made to them
    should be hidden in the financial records of MyGar.  It defies logic to suggest that Eckstein, who
    was not even at MyGar when the kickback scheme was implemented, would arrive at
    MyGar and unilaterally decide how the payments should be booked without any
    direction from his superiors, Drabinsky and Gottlieb.  After all, it was Drabinsky and Gottlieb, and
    not Eckstein, who needed to hide the true nature of the payments.  </span></p>

    overpayments to the companies who performed services for MyGar, and which contained
    the concealed payments to Drabinsky and Gottlieb, identified the accounts to
    which those payments were to be booked.  It was open to the trial judge to treat this evidence as confirmatory of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The very nature of the IPO is that the public is
    being asked to invest its money in the company. The public is entitled to rely
    on all the financial statements in determining whether to risk funds.
    Principals of a company putting forward financial statements as part of the IPO
    package know this. Where the statements include a falsehood, the investor is at
    risk.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Indeed here, the falsehoods were deliberately left
    in the income statement [<i>sic</i> balance
    sheet] to attract (or to avoid deterring) investors. It was thought that a
    write off would have looked terrible. It follows that the true state of affairs
    would have been less attractive to investors. It follows that the lie was meant
    to induce investors.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The inclusion of a balance sheet that is false is
    an act of deceit, falsehood and dishonesty. Since members of the public are
    entitled to rely on these statements before risking their funds, there is
    potential risk to the public.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the balance sheet is false, it is no answer to
    say that the investors would only look to the income statement. One cannot pick
    and choose sections that may be more or less important to a potential investor.
    The reasons for investing may be as diverse as the number of investors.</p>

    transaction with the Ovitz group whereby they would surrender control over the
    management of Livent – that decision contemplated a full outside due diligence
    review of Livent’s financial records and the installation of a management team
    that would operate independently of Drabinsky and Gottlieb;  </p>

    of Livent to remove certain figures from summaries prepared for Drabinsky and

    adjustments being made in the financial statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence argued that each of these factual pillars
    was inconsistent with the appellants’ having knowledge of the ongoing fraud at
    Livent.  For example, the appellants
    submitted that, on the evidence, they had no reason to believe that Messina, a
    respected chartered accountant from a reputable accounting firm, would go along
    with a fraud.  It would therefore have
    been entirely illogical for the appellants to hire Messina if they knew about
    the fraud.  The appellants argued that
    the hiring of Messina, if properly appreciated by the trial judge, would
    inevitably have left the trial judge with a reasonable doubt on the Livent
    charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants accept that the trial judge dealt at
    length with the “four pillars of reasonable doubt”.  They submit, however, that in doing so, she
    improperly placed an onus on the appellants to show that each was consistent
    only with a lack of knowledge of the fraud.  Counsel submit that it was enough to raise a reasonable doubt if any of
    the four pillars was consistent with a lack of guilty knowledge even if it was
    also consistent with other explanations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not misapply the burden of proof in
    her analysis of the four pillars argument.  The Crown is required to prove the essential elements of the offence
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  Individual
    pieces of evidence, unless they represent the entirety of the evidence on an
    element of the crime, are not subjected to the reasonable doubt standard.  The evidentiary value of the facts underlying
    each of the four pillars depended on what inference, if any, the trial judge
    drew from those facts.  More
    specifically, the evidentiary value of those facts turned on whether the trial
    judge found that those facts informed in any way the appellants’ state of mind
    as it related to the ongoing fraudulent activity at Livent.  The inference to be drawn from primary facts
    is a core responsibility of the trier of fact.  This court will defer to the trial judge’s determination of the
    appropriate inference to be drawn absent a material error.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge analyzed the entirety of the evidence
    relevant to the question of the appellants’ knowledge.  She was not prepared to draw any inference as
    to the appellants’ state of mind from the facts underlying the four
    pillars.  For the reasons she explained at
    some length (paras. 434-450), the trial judge regarded the acts underlying the
    four pillars as equivocal insofar as the appellants’ state of mind was
    concerned.  In doing so, the trial judge
    performed the function assigned to the trier of fact.  She assessed the evidence and decided what
    inference, if any, she could draw from that evidence.  She then applied the burden of proof to the
    totality of the evidence and the inferences she drew from that evidence.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s treatment of the evidence concerning
    the hiring of Messina, at paras. 442-444, demonstrates how she examined each of
    the four pillars:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The hiring of Maria Messina is <u>not consistent
    only with a lack of knowledge of the fraud. There are other possible reasons
    which are consistent with knowledge on the part of Mr. Drabinsky and Mr.
    Gottlieb.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. Messina was a member of the Deloitte &amp;
    Touche audit team. That audit team had been duped by the fraudulent
    adjustments. Perhaps they wrongly assumed she would not find out. Perhaps they
    knew she would and then be drawn into assisting in the fraud out of fear or
    shame. Perhaps they believed that she would be &quot;hooked&quot; by the
    excitement of the company.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The notion of Maria Messina being hooked by the
    company was not far fetched. Despite the difficult work environment, there was
    enough of an appeal to keep people there for a long time. The company was high
    profile and dynamic. Tony Fiorino said it was exciting to work in the
    entertainment industry; it was not &quot;like working for a company that was
    producing widgets.&quot; Even the computer programmer, Raymond Cheong, enjoyed
    the excitement of building theatres, putting on productions and going to
    opening nights. Perhaps they knew that Maria Messina was excited to be part of
    the business. Perhaps they counted on this to keep her there and thereby
    enhance the legitimacy of their improper accounting system by having her as
    CFO.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Whatever the reason for hiring Ms. Messina, the
    fact of her hiring does [not] raise a reasonable doubt.  There are other plausible explanations beyond
    the ignorance of management.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the above analysis shows, the trial judge was unable
    to draw the inference urged by the appellants from the evidence of the decision
    to hire Messina.  As the trier of fact,
    it was her job to decide what inference should be drawn.  Without the inference urged by the defence,
    that evidence did not assist the appellants on the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> issue.  The trial judge made no error in deciding
    what inferences should and should not be drawn from the evidence of the hiring
    of Messina.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We will not address the similar arguments made in
    respect of the other pillars of reasonable doubt relied on by the appellants.  The trial judge analyzed each of these
    submissions.  That analysis was
    essentially the same as her analysis of the evidence involving the hiring of
    Messina.  She did not accept that the
    evidence supported any inference as to the appellants’ state of mind.  She was entitled to take that view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge repeatedly and accurately articulated
    the burden of proof and applied it to the essential elements of the offence as
    they related to each appellant.  Her
    analysis of the four pillars arguments reveals no error in her appreciation of
    the burden of proof or the presumption of innocence.</p>
  <h3>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The misapprehension of evidence and the failure to
    appreciate the significance of evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As with their submissions on the MyGar fraud, the
    appellants submit that the trial judge made several errors in her treatment of
    what the appellants contend was significant evidence on the Livent
    charges.  We will address the main
    arguments individually.  However, we
    begin by reiterating the observation made when addressing the alleged misapprehensions
    of the evidence involving MyGar.  While many
    of the arguments are couched in terms of the misapprehension of evidence, or the
    failure to consider evidence, in oral submissions those arguments quickly
    evolved into attempts to have this court make its own assessment of the merits
    of the various factual disputes that had been litigated and lost by the
    appellants at trial.  We cannot do so.</p>
  <h3><span>(a)</span> <span> </span>     The Q3/97 meeting</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence surrounding the meeting in the fall of 1997 to
    consider the third quarter financial statements.  This was referred to as the Q3/97
    meeting.  The appellants described the
    evidence of this meeting as the “linchpin” of the Crown’s case on count
    two.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Messina testified that Eckstein told her to prepare<span
lang=EN-US> a set of documents for this meeting
    based on the actual accounting numbers and a second set based on the manipulated
    numbers that arbitrarily reduced expenses to increase Livent’s net income.  The documents were for the use of Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb at the meetings that preceded the finalizing of the quarterly
    statements.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Eckstein
    testified that he had been preparing this kind of documentation for quarterly
    meetings since 1994.  He first worked
    under the specific instructions of Gottlieb and Drabinsky, but as time went on,
    simply knew what to do and what was needed to produce a reported net income in
    line with budget predictions.  Eckstein
    testified that, typically, he would prepare simplified summaries of the
    financial information for the appellants, comparing the actual numbers with
    those that he proposed to report in the accounting statements.  Eckstein indicated that these documents were regularly
    discussed with the appellants at these meetings and that Drabinsky, in
    particular, took a dominant role in these discussions.  According to Eckstein, the Q3/97 meeting was
    a typical quarterly meeting.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The significance of the Q3/97 meeting from the Crown’s
    perspective arose out of Messina’s involvement.  This was her first direct participation in the fraud and marked the
    stage in her employment when she appreciated the fraudulent nature of the
    activities at Livent.  Her evidence was
    also the only oral testimony that confirmed Eckstein’s descriptions of these
    quarterly meetings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their factums, counsel for the appellants go through
    a detailed account of the Q3/97 meeting.  The trial judge did the same in her reasons.  The appellants submit that on the
    uncontroverted evidence, that meeting could not have occurred before October
    29, 1997 at 11:18 p.m.  They rest this
    submission on the assertion that the documents that Messina claims she prepared
    for Drabinsky’s and Gottlieb’s perusal could not have been prepared without the
    benefit of the general ledger containing the manipulations.  That document was not available until 11:18
    p.m. on October 29<sup>th</sup>.  The
    appellants further submit that on the uncontested evidence, the meeting could
    not have occurred after the afternoon of November 1, 1997 when the accounting
    material prepared at the meeting was submitted in its final form to the audit
    committee.  The appellants complete their
    submission by reference to uncontroverted evidence that Drabinsky left the
    country at 10:00 a.m. on November 1<sup>st</sup>, and was therefore available
    only for a few hours during the time period in which the meeting could have
    been held.  The appellants submit that
    had the trial judge properly appreciated this evidence, she would have
    concluded that the meeting could not have occurred and would have rejected
    Messina’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with Crown counsel’s submission that the
    defence position itself rests on a misapprehension of the evidence.  Messina did not testify that she needed the
    manipulated general ledger documents to prepare the material for the
    meeting.  She  testified that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I could prepare the pre and post [the documents
    requested by Eckstein] once I had the obviously preliminary G/L and then the
    directions from Mr. Eckstein with respect to the manipulations, because for my
    purposes, I didn’t need the detail by show.  I just needed the lump sum adjusting entry.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, on Messina’s evidence, the meeting could have
    occurred prior to October 29<sup>th</sup>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her testimony, Messina initially put the meeting as
    occurring between October 20<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>.  She later indicated that it must have
    occurred closer to October 29<sup>th</sup>.  When it was suggested to her that the meeting must have occurred between
    October 29<sup>th</sup> and November 1<sup>st</sup> and that Drabinsky could
    not have been present, Messina said that while she may have the date wrong, she
    was 100 percent certain that the meeting occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After thoroughly reviewing the evidence, the trial
    judge said the following, at paras. 376-377:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That said, I believe her evidence as to Mr.
    Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb’s role in the fraud. In particular, I believe her
    evidence about the executive meetings in October 1997 and February 1998. Her
    evidence about the preparations for the meetings was consistent with the
    evidence of the other witnesses as to the way the statements were prepared. Her
    evidence was consistent with the documents that were prepared for the executive
    meetings. Her evidence about Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb being at the table
    where the documents were being discussed and the manipulations directed is
    consistent with that of Mr. Eckstein. Ms. Messina may have got the dates wrong
    for the October meetings, but I believe the meetings did take place.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Her evidence and that of Mr. Eckstein is also
    confirmed by the reality of Livent. It was created by Mr. Drabinsky and Mr.
    Gottlieb. It was their vision. They knew the business. They made it grow. They
    sold the business to investors. They participated in executive meetings. They
    knew the finances. The overspending was rampant. Their need for the funds to
    keep coming in was evident. As Mr. Drabinsky said in October 1997, they could
    not show a loss when money had just come in. Mr. Drabinsky said that they had
    just completed a bond offering and could not show a loss for the third quarter.
    He was referring to the October 1997 bond offering whereby Livent had received
    $125 million U.S. Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb knew what was happening with
    the books.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was open to the trial judge to accept Messina’s
    evidence about the October Q3/97 quarterly meeting even though she could not
    pinpoint the date.  There is no
    misapprehension of the evidence by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants buttress their attack
    on the finding that the Q3/97 meeting took place by pointing to the absence of
    any copies of the documents Messina testified were created for that
    meeting.  They also refer to the very
    different accounts Messina has given of that meeting to different investigating
    authorities. The appellants submit that had the trial judge properly
    appreciated and considered that evidence, she could not reasonably have accepted
    Messina’s evidence about the Q3/97 meeting.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge considered these
    arguments at some length (at paras. 370-376).  She concluded that Messina, “an expert in self preservation”, had
    destroyed any trace of the documents on her computer and lied to the
    authorities, to reduce her exposure flowing from her participation in the
    frauds.  This finding, yet another reason
    to view Messina’s evidence with care, was open to the trial judge on the
    evidence.  The finding is not
    inconsistent with Messina’s testimony.  While she attempted to portray herself more as a victim than a
    participant in the ongoing fraud at Livent, Messina did acknowledge that she
    removed documents from her computer because those documents implicated her in
    the fraud. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that the trial
    judge took an “overly simplistic and entirely inappropriate” approach to the
    meaning to be given to certain documents provided to Drabinsky and Gottlieb for
    their review in the course of the preparation of Livent’s quarterly or annual
    financial statements.  Those documents contained
    entries that referred to “actual” numbers and “reported” numbers.  The appellants contend that the trial judge erroneously
    equated the use of those words with the distinction between “real” numbers and
    “fraudulent” numbers.  The appellants
    argue that the distinction between “reported income” and “actual income” is legitimate
    and well understood by accountants.  According to this submission, the references
    to “reported” numbers simply referred to net income after all legitimate
    adjustments.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants’ submission ignores
    the testimony from Eckstein describing these documents.  The trial judge accepted that testimony (paras.
    422-425).  Eckstein testified that
    summaries were presented to Drabinsky and Gottlieb that contained two columns
    of numbers, one column represented the desired net income after manipulation
    and the other represented the actual expenses and losses.  Eckstein testified that the distinction was
    made clear to, and understood by, Drabinsky and Gottlieb.  Drabinsky and Gottlieb focused on the
    manipulated numbers in the meetings held to discuss the preparation of the
    financial statements.  The trial judge’s
    findings as to the meaning to be given to the words “actual” and “reported” was
    justified on the evidence she accepted.  </span></p>

    employees.  They contend that Fiorino was
    told to delete certain information showing the improper transfer of expenses to
    fixed assets in financial records that were to be given to Gottlieb and
    Drabinsky.  The appellants argue that the
    evidence shows that Eckstein told Fiorino to effectively keep Drabinsky and
    Gottlieb “out of the loop” insofar as the improper treatment of these expenses
    was concerned.  This conduct, the
    appellants allege, was entirely inconsistent with Drabinsky and Gottlieb having
    knowledge of the fraud.  Fiorino’s
    evidence was one of the “four pillars of reasonable doubt” (see above, para. 85).</span></p>

    Fiorino “not to include” the information in the schedules to be given to Drabinsky
    and Gottlieb.  Counsel submits that
    Fiorino in fact testified that he was told to “delete” information from those
    schedules before giving them to Drabinsky and Gottlieb.  The appellants argue that there is a
    significant difference between deleting information and not including
    information.  They submit that the trial
    judge’s failure to appreciate this difference caused her to miss the
    significance of Fiorino’s evidence to the defence.</span></p>

    need not be included in reports prepared for Drabinsky and Gottlieb prior to

    439:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Fiorino said that Mr. Eckstein said it was not necessary to include the
    transferred amounts because management knew it was there.  This is not exactly a direction to hide.  Even if it were, no other employees were
    given those instructions.  The attempt
    throughout was to be sure that management had all the information.  They were given the P &amp; L statements at
    the end of 1997 to remind them of the problems that were being shifted to
    1998.  This is the antithesis of keeping

lang=EN-US>The appellants next argue that the

    statements fraudulent.  They submit that
    the trial judge wrongly equated the use of certain accounting practices to

    contend that because the trial judge did not appreciate the nature of the fraud
    she never turned her mind to whether Drabinsky and Gottlieb had knowledge that
    the underlying documentation was being altered and forged on Eckstein’s
    initiative.  The appellants submit that

    earlier, (see above, para. 49 and following) the trial judge appreciated that
    the use of accounting practices to defer expenses was not in and of itself
    fraudulent.  She held that the fraud lay
    in the arbitrary and unjustified used of various accounting practices to

    to achieve projected income levels.  The
    trial judge did not find that Drabinsky’s and Gottlieb’s desire to achieve
    projected incomes was fraudulent.  She
    did find, however, that it was fraudulent to orchestrate the manipulation of Livent’s
    financial records to achieve projected income figures when to the knowledge of
    Gottlieb and Drabinsky those figures did not reflect the ongoing financial
    reality at Livent.  </span></p>

    with the description of the process that Eckstein and Messina testified was
    followed within Livent to regularly produce the fraudulent financial statements.  That process involved the preparation of various
    documents for Drabinsky and Gottlieb by Livent employees followed by lengthy

    statements were manipulated.  On their evidence,
    the fraudulent statements were the product of an institutionalized process that
    functioned on a day-to- day basis within the Livent office.  Falsification of records was part of the
    office routine at Livent.  The trial
    judge found, and there was abundant evidence to support this finding, that this

    statements signed by Gottlieb and Drabinsky and delivered to the auditors and
    potential investors and lenders.  That
    process, which was described in detail by Eckstein and others, did not depend
    on whether a particular meeting occurred on a certain day or whether Drabinsky and
    Gottlieb attended a particular meeting.  The process depended on the occurrence of a pattern of events that

    significant evidence that the testimony of both Messina and Eckstein was
    tainted by the access that each had to the testimony of the other.  The appellants submit that in the course of
    her employment with the Ovitz litigation team, Messina had access to everything,
    including Eckstein’s various statements.  They further submit that Eckstein, as a co-accused of Drabinsky and
    Gottlieb for many months, had access to all of Messina’s statements and
    testimony, including her preliminary inquiry evidence.  Counsel contend that the trial judge was
    obligated to infer from this access that Messina’s testimony was influenced by
    her knowledge of what Eckstein would say, and that Eckstein’s testimony was
    influenced by his knowledge of what Messina would say.  This tainting meant that the evidence of

    disclosure and all preliminary inquiry transcripts.  There is, however, no evidence linking that
    access to anything to which Messina or Eckstein testified.  When asked where the possibility of tainting
    was explored in the evidence, counsel pointed to one part of Eckstein’s cross-examination.  In that exchange, Eckstein denied reading the
    preliminary inquiry transcripts, although he acknowledged that he knew full

    testimony of the other was not pursued in any significant way at trial.  The possibility of tainting, while clearly
    relevant, was not in and of itself enough to say that the evidence of one of
    those witnesses could not be independent of the other.  Nor do we infer from the trial judge’s
    failure to refer specifically to tainting that she did not appreciate its
    potential significance when assessing whether the evidence of one witness could
    confirm the evidence of the other.  We interpret
    her silence rather as a reflection of the relative insignificance of the
    tainting claim when placed beside the powerful and partially successful

    a matter of controversy and speculation.  However, it would seem that if the prospect of a long jail sentence will
    deter anyone from planning and committing a crime, it would deter people like
    the appellants who are intelligent individuals, well aware of potential
    consequences, and accustomed to weighing potential future risks against
    potential benefits before taking action:  <i>R. v. Gray</i> <i>(L.V.) et al.</i> (1995), 76 O.A.C. 387, at

lang=EN-US>The amendments to the fraud
    provisions made in September 2004, while inapplicable to this case, both raise
    the maximum sentence and specifically identify certain factors found in
    sophisticated frauds as aggravating factors.  Those are the same factors that have caused appellate courts to stress
    general deterrence and denunciation in the sentencing of those who engage in
    large scale premeditated frauds on the public marketplace:  see <i>An
    Act to Amend the Criminal Code (Capital Markets Fraud and Evidence-Gathering)</i>,<i> </i>S.C. 2004, c. 3, ss. 2 and 3.  The statutory amendments follow the

    quantification in cases like this is also driven by the need to publicly
    denounce the appellants’ criminal conduct.  The length of the sentence imposed is reflective of the appropriate
    level of denunciation.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>After reviewing several authorities,
    the trial judge fixed the appropriate range of sentence for large scale,
    premeditated frauds involving public companies at between five and eight years
    (para. 35).  While one might quibble
    about both ends of that spectrum, the trial judge was correct in determining
    that crimes like those committed by the appellants must normally attract
    significant penitentiary terms well beyond the two-year limit applicable to
    conditional sentences.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not, however,
    reject Drabinsky’s submission that she should impose a conditional sentence
    merely because that sentence was outside of the range of sentencing for this
    kind of offence.  The trial judge
    appreciated that it was her ultimate responsibility to fix a fit sentence
    having regard to all relevant factors.  She understood that a proper application of the mitigating factors could
    in some cases result in a fit sentence that was outside of the applicable range:  <i>R. v.
    Nasogaluak</i>, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 44.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It is impossible to catalogue the
    factors that in combination could justify a sentence below the usually
    applicable range.  We would, however,
    make two observations.  First, the investigation
    and prosecution of crimes like these is difficult and expensive.  It places significant stress on the limited
    resources available to the police and the prosecution.  An early guilty plea coupled with full
    cooperation with the police and regulators and <i>bona fide</i> efforts to compensate those harmed by the frauds has
    considerable value to the administration of justice.  The presence of those factors, depending of
    course on the other circumstances, may merit sentences outside of the range.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, individuals who perpetrate
    frauds like these are usually seen in the community as solid, responsible and
    law-abiding citizens.  Often, they suffer
    personal and financial ruin as a result of the exposure of their frauds.  Those factors cannot, however, alone justify
    any departure from the range.  The
    offender’s prior good character and standing in the community are to some
    extent the tools by which they commit and sustain frauds over lengthy time
    periods.  Considerable personal hardship,
    if not ruin, is virtually inevitable upon exposure of one’s involvement in
    these kinds of frauds.  It cannot be
    regarded as the kind of unusual circumstance meriting departure from the range.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In holding that prior good character
    and the personal consequences of the fraud cannot push the appropriate sentence
    outside of the range, we do not suggest that they are not relevant mitigating
    factors.  They must be considered in
    determining where within the range the sentence should fall.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge recognized the many mitigating
    factors advanced on behalf of the appellants.  These included their many and diverse contributions to the community,
    particularly the cultural community, their strong family support, their sterling
    reputations in the community, the absence of any criminal record and, in Drabinsky’s
    case, his significant physical disability.  Drabinsky suffers from the effects of polio, a disease he had as a young
    child.  His mobility is impaired and he
    is often in considerable pain.  His
    problems will worsen with age.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree with the trial judge’s
    determination that the mitigating factors, while impressive, did not justify a
    departure from the established range of sentence.  In particular, there is no evidence that
    Drabinsky’s health problems, while significant, cannot be addressed by the
    correctional authorities.  Certainly, on
    the trial evidence, Drabinsky leads a very full and active life, despite his
    very real disability.  We think the trial
    judge was correct in determining that the sentences should fall within the
    range of sentences imposed for this type of offence.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>The appellants also submit that the
    trial judge gave inadequate weight to the appellants’ motives.  They stress that the crime was not one driven
    by greed.  Livent was far from a “scam”.  The appellants did not set out to cheat MyGar
    and Livent investors with a view to leaving those investors with nothing while
    lining their own pockets.  The appellants
    clearly believed that Livent would ultimately be a huge success and that everyone,
    including themselves, would benefit greatly by the existence of a thriving live
    theatre community in Canada and elsewhere.  On this submission, the appellants’ error lay in the means chosen to
    achieve a laudable end.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    defence stress that this was not a case of “pure greed” as described in the
    jurisprudence and which has been considered an aggravating factor.  Indeed, this was not a case of funds misappropriated
    for the acquisition of material goods.  That said, the absence of this pure greed factor is not mitigating.  Unlike some fraud cases, this was not a
    company set up for the purpose of a scam.  It operated a legitimate business during the course of which fraudulent
    misrepresentations were made.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree that cases properly
    characterized as “scams” will normally call for significantly longer sentences
    than frauds committed in the course of the operation of a legitimate
    business.  Whether the absence of “pure
    greed” is viewed as a mitigating factor or simply as the absence of an
    aggravating factor would seem to make little difference in the ultimate
    calculation.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We see no error in the trial judge’s
    treatment of the appellants’ motivation for their frauds.  They were not fraudsters in the purest
    sense.  They were trying to operate a
    legitimate business of potential benefit to the entire community.  That said, however, their motives were not
    altruistic.  While they operated Livent
    and created its false prosperity through their frauds, they lived the lives of
    successful, prominent and powerful international entrepreneurs.  There were significant financial benefits
    flowing to both appellants from the operation of Livent.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that the trial
    judge erred in principle in treating the fraud as a “large scale” commercial
    fraud in the absence of any evidence quantifying the economic loss caused by
    the fraud.  The trial judge was clearly
    concerned about the quantum of the fraud during the sentencing submissions.  She questioned Crown counsel on the topic
    both in his initial submissions and in reply.  Crown counsel took the position that it could not put a dollar figure on
    the fraud, but that there was ample evidence that Livent’s investors and lenders
    suffered large losses as a result of the fraud.  Counsel put it this way in his initial submissions on sentence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial of this matter did not deal in any comprehensive way with the restatement
    of Livent’s finances or the subsequent collapse of Livent.  Those matters are the subject of various
    related civil court proceedings, some of which are alluded to in this trial and
    are still pending.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown is not seeking to intrude into this area for purposes of sentencing and,
    accordingly, is not seeking a compensation order.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[176]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>He also said in reply:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US>The
    company collapsed, and it was a large company.  So there was a massive loss. …</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…
    The company went into receivership.  And
    there’s a complex process for deciding, you know, who gets what out of what’s
    left.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>But
    the Crown’s position is, it’s not necessary to go beyond the fact that this is
    a fraud that had major implications, the collapse of a sizeable company.  The number is really neither here nor there.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[177]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Counsel for the appellants argued
    that the financial demise of Livent could not be attributed to the fraud.  Counsel put it this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>But
    there’s still a very live question as to whether or not new management
    inherited a viable company.  And the
    whole question of the loss – why the company went into bankruptcy, is
    enormously complex.  Not decided at this
    trial and not – not yet decided in the civil actions.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>And,
    indeed, there’s been reference before you to the Deloitte &amp; Touche
    litigation, in other words, the litigation that’s brought by Livent against
    Deloitte &amp; Touche, claimed amount of half a billion dollars,
    $500,000,000.  That litigation is still
    outstanding.  And so the whole question
    of whether or not there may yet be a recovery for creditors and for
    shareholders remains to be outstanding.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>And
    so in my respectful submission, the evidence before you does not admit of any
    amount of quantifiable loss as a result of the fraudulent activity which you
    have found.  Clearly, there was a risk
    created by the misrepresentations, but the loss has not, in our respectful
    submission, been quantified before you.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>In her reasons for sentence, the
    trial judge made a single brief reference to the quantum of the fraud, at para.
    24:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There
    was a direct link between the financial manipulations and the share value.  While the exact dollar value of the fraud is
    not known, the investments made in the public company were over $500,000,000.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The negative effect of crime on its
    victims is always an important consideration in sentencing.  In fraud cases, actual economic loss is one
    of the obvious negative consequences potentially suffered by victims.  The trial judge did not make any finding as
    to the exact quantum of the economic loss caused by either the MyGar or Livent
    frauds.  It is unclear whether the trial
    judge viewed the $500 million figure as somehow representative of the order of
    magnitude of the fraud and, if so, how she reached that conclusion.   There is nothing in the evidence to connect the
    $500 million figure referred to by the trial judge to the loss caused by the frauds.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[180]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On our review of the trial
    transcript, the Crown made no submissions at trial alleging any actual economic
    loss as a result of the MyGar fraud.  While the misrepresentations in the IPO were sufficient to establish a risk
    of economic prejudice, we see no evidentiary basis for a finding of any actual
    economic loss.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[181]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Insofar as the Livent fraud is
    concerned, we agree that the inability to place a dollar figure on the fraud
    does not mean that it was wrongly characterized as a “large scale” commercial fraud.  The fraud went on for years and involved the
    systematic misrepresentation of the financial statements in amounts well into
    the millions of dollars.  Even though the
    Crown made no attempt to quantify the fraud, the evidence clearly justified the
    inference of significant economic harm to investors and creditors of
    Livent.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[182]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We do agree with the appellants,
    however, that in the absence of evidence from the Crown, it was wrong to
    attribute the ultimate failure of Livent to the fraud.  The causes of Livent’s demise were admittedly
    numerous and complex.  This matter was
    not explored in the course of the criminal trial and the state of the record
    does not permit allocation of responsibility for the bankruptcy to the fraud.  The bankruptcy no doubt caused significant
    losses to creditors, employees and investors.  Those losses cannot, in our view, be laid entirely at the feet of
    Drabinsky and Gottlieb.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>This passage could be read as a
    finding by the trial judge that the financial consequences of the bankruptcy
    were the product of the fraud.  With
    respect to the trial judge, before she could make that finding she had to come
    to grips with the question of the extent to which the financial loss flowing
    from the bankruptcy could be attributed to the fraud.  The Crown cannot, on the one hand, refrain
    from joining issue on the actual loss attributable to the fraud and, on the
    other hand, ask the sentencing court to assume the worst for the purposes of
    sentencing.  The Crown is obligated to
    prove all aggravating factors on sentence beyond a reasonable doubt.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>On this record, while it can safely
    be said that the fraud was a factor in the bankruptcy, it cannot be said that
    the fraud caused the bankruptcy and the subsequent financial losses.  Where the actual economic harm caused by a
    fraud is uncertain, the sentencing judge must give the benefit of that
    uncertainty to the accused.  The trial
    judge should have approached this case as one in which the Crown had proved the
    ultimate inevitability of significant loss, but had not proved a fraud of a
    specific magnitude or that the insolvency was the product of the fraud.     </span></p>

    prominent business leaders who are directors and officers of public companies
    engage in fraudulent activity, the public faith in, and the integrity of, the
