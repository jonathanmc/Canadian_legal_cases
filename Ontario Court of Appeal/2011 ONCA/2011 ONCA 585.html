  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge (SCAJ)
    erred in dismissing his appeal from a finding of guilty of impaired driving. 
    He has been granted leave to appeal and appeals his conviction on the basis
    that he was arbitrarily detained under s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He submits
    that, as a result, the observations of the breathalyzer technician as to his
    impairment should be excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant agrees that the initial stop by police was lawful due to
    his “bad driving”.  He submits, however, that as the police did not observe the
    usual signs of impairment such as glassy eyes, alcohol on his breath, and
    slurred speech, there were no grounds to make a demand for a sample of his
    breath and his continued detention was an arbitrary detention that contravened
    s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If, as the evidence suggests, the appellant would have been arrested in
    any event for dangerous driving, his detention would not have been arbitrary.  However,
    the appellant submits that, in that event, when the police brought him before a
    breathalyzer technician the detention became arbitrary because Parliament has
    developed a scheme to deal with alcohol-related offences and the officers did
    not comply with it.  Although the results of the breathalyzer tests were
    excluded by the trial judge, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in admitting the observations of impairment made by the breathalyzer technician
    quite apart from the breathalyzer readings.  The appellant submits that, as his
    continued detention was arbitrary, these observations ought to be excluded
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The appellant’s initial detention was lawful pursuant to
    s. 216(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.<i> </i> The lack of reasonable
    grounds to arrest the appellant for impaired driving did not convert his
    detention into an arbitrary detention.  The appellant’s continued detention was
    justified to further the investigation into his horrendous driving.  The
    observations of the breathalyzer technician were admissible as evidence of
    impairment because they did not arise as a result of a <i>Charter </i>violation. 
    The observations made by the breathalyzer technician could have been made by
    any police officer at the station.  The appellant was not arbitrarily
    detained.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ properly deferred to the trial judge’s admission of the
    technician’s observations.  A strong line of authority supports the proposition
    that a police officer’s observations<i> </i>of a lawfully detained suspect are
    not conscriptive evidence because they were not obtained through the suspect’s
    participation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we note that the argument now advanced by the appellant was
    never made to the SCAJ.  An appeal to this court is not a second chance to
    reargue an appeal from the trial judge.  In any event, we agree with the SCAJ’s
    disposition of the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
