  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HSBC Canada Bank (HSBC) brought a motion to be added as
    a creditor in the bankruptcy application of Jack <span class=SpellE>Lechcier-Kimel</span> (JLK).  HSBC’s motion was granted.  JLK filed a notice of appeal from that
    decision.  HSBC brought a motion for an
    order that JLK requires leave of this court to pursue an appeal pursuant to s.
    193(e) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency
    Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended (<i>BIA</i>).  In the event that leave is required, HSBC
    submits that I should refuse to grant leave on the basis that JLK’s appeal has
    no merit.  Finally, and in the
    alternative, if leave is granted, HSBC seeks an order expediting the appeal and
    security for costs.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>JLK argues that leave is not required but, if leave is
    required, JLK has now brought a cross-motion requesting leave.  JLK also submits that, if leave is required,
    a panel of three judges should decide the leave application as opposed to a
    single judge sitting in chambers.  JLK further
    submits that it has a good, arguable appeal and would agree to an order
    expediting the hearing of the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I must first deal with the question of whether leave is
    required and whether a single judge can grant leave.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant portions of s. 193 of the <i>BIA</i> provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unless otherwise expressly provided, an appeal lies
    to the Court of Appeal from any order or decision of a judge of the court in
    the following cases: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) if the point at issue involves future
    rights;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e) in any other case by leave of a judge of
    the Court of Appeal.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The original
    bankruptcy application was brought with respect to both JLK and his spouse, <span
class=SpellE>Mahavash</span> <span class=SpellE>Lechcier-Kimel</span> (MLK).  By consent order, there are now two separate
    proceedings.  In the proceeding involving
    MLK, on the question of whether an appeal from an order adding an applicant
    creditor requires leave, Gillese J.A. held that leave is necessary and that
    adding a party does not raise a point involving future rights.  I agree with her.  In<i> Elias v. Hutchison </i>(1981), 121 D.L.R. (3d) 95 (Alta. C.A.), the court dealt
    with whether leave was required to appeal an order dismissing an application to
    sue the trustee.  The court held that
    there was no appeal as of right.  The
    appeal did not involve future rights since future rights are those rights that are
    not asserted at the present time but that will come into existence at a future
    time.  The issue was whether a present
    right to sue the trustee existed.  The
    definition of future rights in <i>Elias</i> was
    approved by this court in <span class=SpellE><i>Ravelston</i></span><i> Corp. (Re)</i>,
    2005 <span class=SpellE>CanLII</span> 63802 (ON CA), at para. 19.  As in <i>Elias, </i>the case before me does not involve future rights since the issue is HSBC’s
    present right to be added as a creditor.   <i> </i></p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the decision of Gillese J.A., counsel for MLK has
    brought a further motion before Armstrong J.A. to set aside her order on the
    basis that the notice of motion did not clearly indicate that a motion for leave
    to appeal was to be heard and for that reason responding counsel did not
    appear. Armstrong J.A. has dismissed that motion.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of leave and whether leave should be granted
    was fully argued before me.   </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the question of whether a single judge can grant
    leave or whether the decision ought to be made by a panel, I note that s. 193
    specifically states that leave can be granted by “a judge” of the Court of
    Appeal.  Thus, leave is required and a
    single judge of this court can grant leave. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the question of whether leave should be
    granted.  On an application for leave to
    appeal under s. 193(e) of the <i>BIA</i>,
    one factor that is considered in all cases is whether the appeal is <i>prima facie </i>meritorious.  In this regard, while not assessing or
    deciding on the ultimate merits of the proposed appeal, the applicant must
    convince the court that the appeal raises arguable points that create “a
    realistic possibility of success on the appeal”: see <span class=SpellE><i>Ravelston</i></span><i> Corporation Limited (Re)</i>,<i> </i> 2007 ONCA 268, at paras. 11-12.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Before me,
    JLK advances two primary grounds of appeal.  The first is that the motions judge erred in finding that the applicant
    creditor, Community Trust Company (CTC), was not prosecuting the proceedings
    with due diligence and effect as required by s. 43(13) of the <i>BIA</i>.  At para. 21 of his reasons, the motions judge
    observed that, during the cross-examination of Tara <span class=SpellE>Rolston</span> on her affidavit, counsel for CTC stated that CTC was not seeking to pursue <i>either</i> of the applications for
    bankruptcy at that point (which was over a year from the bankruptcy
    application). The motions judge held, at para. 22, “Mr. <span class=SpellE>Reininger</span>,
    as counsel for a party, made a clear statement binding on the applicant, CTC,
    which is admissible as evidence of CTC’s intentions regarding these
    applications.”  JLK submits that
    counsel’s statement cannot be relied upon and treated as evidence as the
    statement is unsworn and was not specifically adopted by the affiant being
    cross-examined.  </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This first ground of appeal does not meet the test. The
    statement by CTC’s counsel was an admission by counsel on behalf of his client.
    Counsel for JLK has provided no authority to suggest that the motions judge
    made a palpable and overriding error in relying on this admission.      </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this ground of appeal advanced by JLK is the
    same ground advanced in the MLK proceedings.  In MLK, Gillese J.A. held that she would
    refuse to grant leave as the purported appeal from the decision adding a party
    “is without merit and the issue it raised is not of significance to the
    practice or the MLK bankruptcy application, as paragraph 2 of the order of 24
    March 2011 specifically preserves all of Ms. <span class=SpellE>Lechcier-Kimel’s</span> rights and defences on the MLK bankruptcy application.” Those comments are
    equally applicable here.</p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The second
    ground of appeal is that the motions judge erred in not exercising his discretion
    to decide a question of law and in leaving that question to the hearing of the
    bankruptcy application. The question of law is whether the entire bankruptcy
    proceedings are a nullity.  Inasmuch as
    the original application for bankruptcy was brought with respect to both JLK
    and MLK, as opposed to a separate application against each of them, JLK submits
    that the entire proceedings are a nullity and not a defect that can be cured
    under the <i>BIA.  </i>JLK submits that the motion judge’s deferral
    of the question of law offends the principle that proceedings should be
    conducted in the least expensive manner and that the motions judge erred in
    principle in adjourning the question to the trial of the bankruptcy, which was
    scheduled for a month later. </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal also does not meet the test. No
    authority has been provided to me to support the submission that it is an error
    in principle for a judge to adjourn a question of law to the trial of the
    bankruptcy.  Indeed, important issues of
    law are often decided based on a full factual record.  While the parties would often like to know the
    outcome of an important legal issue to assist them in preparing for trial - thus
    potentially saving time and money - that goal alone does not trump the judge’s
    exercise of discretion and force him or her to decide the question of law
    before the trial of the bankruptcy application.   </p>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would refuse leave to appeal. In view of
    my decision, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the alternative relief
    requested. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of this motion are to HSBC and, on consent, are
    fixed in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and all applicable taxes.  </p>
