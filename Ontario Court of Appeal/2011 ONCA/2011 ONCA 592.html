  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant admitted killing Clive McNabb, the former
    spouse of his common law partner, Carol Allamby. However, he testified that he killed
    McNabb in self-defence by stabbing him once with a knife after McNabb moved
    towards him with an open knife.  The appellant
    further testified that McNabb had violently attacked him on two previous
    occasions.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black;'>The
    appellant was charged with second-degree murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following a trial
    by jury, he was acquitted on the murder charge but convicted of
    manslaughter.&nbsp; The principal issue at trial was whether the Crown proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant did not act in lawful
    self-defence.&nbsp; Implicit in the jury’s verdict is a rejection of the
    appellant’s position that he killed McNabb in self-defence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black;'>The
    principal issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in various alleged
    respects in his jury instructions concerning the elements of self-defence in s.
    34(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46. I conclude that the trial judge erred in one respect:  by permitting the jury to consider the
    appellant’s failure to retreat from his home in assessing the reasonableness of
    the appellant’s response to the threat he perceived from McNabb.  That error was fatal in my view, and thus a
    new trial is required.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>As I would allow the appeal and order a new trial, my review of the
    evidence is limited to what is necessary to dispose of the central issue on
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Allamby were involved in a
    long-term relationship.&nbsp;They lived in an apartment that the appellant had
    leased about one month before the events giving rise to the charge.&nbsp; The
    stabbing of McNabb took place in the bedroom of their<span class=term2lmrp><span
style='color:black;'> </span></span>apartment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The common link between the appellant and McNabb
    was Allamby, who, in addition to being the appellant’s common law wife, was also
    the mother of McNabb’s two children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>At trial, the defence led evidence of two prior incidents of violent
    behaviour by McNabb against the appellant.&nbsp;One of the incidents took place
    approximately two-and-one-half years prior to the stabbing; the other
    approximately one month prior.  This
    evidence was tendered by the defence in support of the assertion that McNabb
    had a propensity for violence against the appellant and was the aggressor in
    the fatal confrontation between them.&nbsp;Although the Crown disputed the
    nature, extent and responsibility for the prior two incidents between McNabb
    and the appellant, there was ample evidence of animosity between the two men before
    the date of the killing.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McNabb had a full-time job as a computer
    technician and ran a small computer business.  He and the appellant also both dealt in drugs. Indeed, McNabb supplied
    the appellant and Allamby with drugs and was allowed to use their premises as a
    base to sell cocaine.  <span
style='color:black;'>The appellant acknowledged his
    own drug-dealing activities in his evidence at trial.  He testified to keeping several knives in
    various rooms, specifically the bedroom and bathroom of the apartment, to be
    used in the event that trouble arose during drug transactions.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>The evidence at trial established that on the day of the killing an
    acquaintance of the appellant and Allamby named Lori Mazzei mentioned to McNabb
    that a man named Joe Grasso was at the appellant’s and Allamby’s
    apartment.&nbsp; Grasso apparently owed McNabb a drug debt. McNabb went to the appellant’s
    apartment with the apparent intention of collecting his money from Grasso.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>The stabbing occurred in the bedroom of the apartment.  McNabb went into the bedroom to confront Grasso
    about the drug debt.&nbsp;Allamby reproached McNabb for entering her bedroom
    and an argument occurred between them. The defence evidence was that McNabb either
    pushed or slapped Allamby. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>The appellant then entered the bedroom and, after he and McNabb began to
    argue, Allamby left the bedroom. The defence evidence was that McNabb pulled
    out a knife and threatened the appellant with it. The appellant then grabbed
    for a knife that was hidden in a closet and stabbed McNabb once, after which
    McNabb slumped to the floor.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=apple-style-span><span
style='color:black'>When the police arrived at the front door of the apartment
    building, they were approached by Allamby and Mazzei, who let the officers into
    the building and led them to the apartment. The police found McNabb on the
    floor of the bedroom in a seated position with his back against a chair.&nbsp;
    He was unresponsive and had no pulse.&nbsp; There was a stream of blood coming
    from his mouth and a large pool of blood located around him.&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='color:black;'>A knife belonging to McNabb with
    his blood on the blade was found by the police on the floor near his body. The
    knife was in a closed position.  The
    death of McNabb was caused by a single lethal stab wound to the chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black;'>The foregoing is a general account of some of the evidence adduced at
    trial that gave rise to the appellant’s conviction. I refer to other evidence
    relevant to the issues on appeal as I proceed through my analysis.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, counsel agreed that the trial judge should
    only charge the jury on self-defence under s. 34(2)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and not under the other self-defence provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The trial
    judge also charged the jury on the intent for murder and provocation.  Both the Crown and the defence were provided
    with draft and final copies of the charge. Counsel did not raise any objections
    to the charge.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the first time on appeal, the appellant raises
    several issues concerning the trial judge’s charge on self-defence. The
    appellant submits that the trial judge committed three errors in the portion of
    his charge on the elements of the defence of self-defence under s. 34(2):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   The trial judge erred in asking the jury to
    consider whether the appellant was unlawfully assaulted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in suggesting to the jury that
    self-defence was not available if the appellant was the initial aggressor. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in permitting the jury to consider
    whether the appellant ought to have retreated from his own home as a factor in
    assessing the availability of self-defence under s. 34(2).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also in relation to self-defence, the appellant
    contends that the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury on the
    availability of other self-defence provisions in ss. 37 and 41 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advanced two further grounds of appeal in
    his written submissions. First, he objected to the admission at trial of
    evidence of his general propensity for violence for purposes of balancing
    evidence concerning the deceased’s specific propensity for violence. This
    ground of appeal was abandoned in oral argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the appellant raised a ground of appeal
    concerning the conduct of the trial Crown (not the Crown on appeal), saying
    that her conduct resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  He did not press this ground in oral argument
    and conceded that the impugned conduct of the trial Crown was unlikely to be sufficient
    to warrant a new trial. There is no reason to canvass this issue in view of the
    result I reach.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I explain more fully below, I would give effect to
    the appellant’s third argument concerning the trial judge’s instructions on s.
    34(2).  In particular, I conclude that
    the trial judge erred in his instructions on s. 34(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> by permitting the jury to
    consider whether the appellant ought to have retreated from his own home.  In my view, the authorities establish that,
    in the circumstances of this case, “retreat” was not a proper factor for the
    jury to consider.  That the jury was
    allowed to do so amounts to an error in law that requires a new trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>Instructions on self-defence under
    s. 34(2)</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For ease of reference, I first set out the provisions
    of s. 34(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>34. (2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted and
    who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified
    if</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>(a) he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or
    grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally
    made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>(b) he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot
    otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Self-defence under s. 34(2) requires proof of three
    elements: (i) an unlawful assault against the appellant; (ii) the appellant
    must have had a reasonable apprehension of a risk of death or grievous bodily
    harm; and (iii) the appellant must have reasonably believed that it was
    necessary to cause harm or death to the victim in order to avoid the same
    fate:  see <i>R. v Cinous</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 93. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant alleges that the trial judge committed
    two errors in his instructions on the first element of the defence of
    self-defence under s. 34(2). One of these alleged errors was raised for the
    first time in oral argument on appeal. In particular, the appellant asserts
    that the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to argue that McNabb was not
    assaulting the appellant. According to the appellant, the jury ought to have
    been instructed that this first element under s. 34(2) was satisfied based on
    the evidence at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s other argument in connection with the
    first element of the defence is that the trial judge erred in instructing the
    jury that whether or not the appellant was being unlawfully assaulted turned on
    which one of the two men was the “initial aggressor”.  The appellant says that on these
    instructions, if the jury were to find that McNabb was not the initial
    aggressor, then the jury might decide that self-defence was not available to
    the appellant, which would be an error in law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the third element under s. 34(2), the
    appellant argues that the Crown should not have made the appellant’s ability to
    retreat a live issue. He says that the trial judge, having permitted the Crown
    to raise this issue, was required to clearly instruct the jury that the
    appellant had no obligation to retreat from his home.  It is this issue that I conclude disposes of
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    questioned him about how long it would have taken him to go from the bedroom to
    the front door.  He replied:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.  In

    because you’re on the outside of the bedroom.  Correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.  Ma’am,
    yea, and he’s pulling it [the bedroom door] open.  I got dress shoes on;  he’s got running shoes on.  As soon as the door – and my hallway – and
    you can see it from the video across there I could have fall.  I’ve been stabbed before by this man; I’ve
    been attacked by this man. I’m not taking that chance of running out and he
    falling on top of me.  I can’t do that.
    I’m sorry.</p>

    Crown put the issue of retreat squarely to the jury and urged them to find that
    the appellant could have retreated from the apartment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>[H]e gives us
    an elaborate explanation that he couldn’t have run</i>, he couldn’t have asked
    someone to call the police, he couldn’t have asked Carol [Allamby] to call 911

    he’s on the outside of the door, ladies and gentlemen, someone is coming at you
    with a knife you’re not going to be concerned that you’re [not?] wearing
    running shoes.  <i>I think you’re going to bolt.  The door to the hallway was right there</i>. <i> If he wanted to pull the door
    why didn’t he pull that door shut open [sic].  At least he was outside of the apartment, </i>there are other people living
    in the apartment. No. He goes for the knife; went for the knife because that
    was his initial intention. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s oral instructions to the jury

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is the Crown’s position that Mr. Forde was not
    acting in lawful self-defence, and could have used other options instead of
    stabbing the deceased but chose not to avail himself of such options.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his specific instructions on the third element of
    self-defence under s. 34(2), the trial judge told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Consider, as well, again the relative size,
    strength and positioning of Forde and McNabb, proximity of the two individuals,
    the suddenness of the assault by Clive McNabb, Mr. Forde’s evidence as to his
    state of mind when he stabbed Mr. McNabb.  <i>And the availability of other
    options for Cedric Forde to extricate him from the confrontation with Clive
    McNabb</i>.  And the likelihood of Mr.
    McNabb persisting in his attack. Those are all factors and questions you’ll

    must understand that a person under attack must often make a decision quickly,
    without time for calm and detached reflection. In other words, “a person
    defending himself against attack, reasonably apprehended, cannot be expected to
    weigh to a nicety, the exact measure of necessary defensive action”.  Nevertheless, I do not believe that these

    obligation on the appellant to retreat. Rather, he merely and quite properly
    left the appellant’s ability to retreat as a factor the jury could consider in
    deciding whether the appellant had no other means to preserve himself.  In support of its position, the Crown relies
    on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Cain</i></span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;'>, 2011 ONCA 298, at paras. 9 and 11,</span><span lang=EN-US> which state:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unlike s. 35 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 34(2)
    does not require defendants to retreat in the face of an assault, but rather
    permits defendants to stand their ground during the early stages of a
    confrontation.&nbsp; However, as the appellant properly concedes, the
    possibility of retreat is relevant to the second and third elements of the s.
    34(2) defence, namely, the issues of whether the appellant did have a
    reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, and whether the
    appellant had a reasonable belief that it was not otherwise possible to save
    himself from harm except by killing Willis: [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>... However, had Crown counsel told the jury that
    the appellant was precluded from raising the defence of self-defence because he
    had failed to retreat at the start of the <span class=grame>confrontation, </span>the
    respondent concedes that the trial judge would have been required to give a
    correcting instruction. The appellant in turn concedes that Crown counsel did
    not explicitly make that erroneous submission to the jury.&nbsp; The issue for
    us to decide is whether there was a sufficient risk that the jury could have
    understood Crown counsel to be making that erroneous submission, requiring a
    correcting instruction from the trial judge.</p>

    limitations on the issue of retreat: (i) retreat is not relevant where it is
    not a realistic option to the accused; and (ii) people are generally not
    expected to abandon their homes in order to avoid engaging in acts of
    self-defence. However, the Crown
    submits that while there is no specific duty or requirement to retreat in s.
    34(2), the ability to retreat is nonetheless a factor that may be taken into
    account in considering whether the accused had no other means to preserve
    himself – including in cases where the attack occurs in the accused’s own home.
    According to the Crown, this factor is relevant to the reasonableness of the
    accused’s belief that he could not otherwise save himself in the circumstances
    as he perceived them to be. </span></p>

    according to the Crown, there is no absolute bar against the consideration of
    retreat within the household context.  Rather, the home context merely attenuates or weakens considerations of
    retreat. The Crown submits that the trial Crown did not run afoul of these
    principles in suggesting in her cross-examination that the appellant had other
    options available to him such as screaming out, calling for help, and running
    out of the apartment, or in reminding the jury of these options in her closing
    argument. The trial Crown at no time suggested there was an obligation on the
    appellant to retreat from his home in order to avail himself of the defence of self-defence.
     Nor did the trial judge err in
    permitting the jury to consider as a factor the appellant’s ability to retreat.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Retreat in the context of the law of self-defence
    reflects the principle that killing or seriously injuring another person should
    only be sanctioned as a last resort and should not be permitted if other
    reasonable options are available.  However, it is well-established at common law that different considerations
    apply where a person is attacked in his or her own home. These considerations
    are encapsulated in the rather archaic maxim “a man’s home is his castle.” The origins of the so-called “castle
    doctrine” lie in Lord Coke’s statement in <i>Semayne’s
    Case</i> (1604), 77 E.R. 194 (K.B.), at p. 195: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That the house of everyone is to him as his castle

    repose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The maxim that
    a man’s home is his castle has given rise to the principle that a person has
    the right to defend him or herself in his or her own home without the duty to
    retreat from the home in the face of an attack. As Cardozo J. put it in <i>People v. Tomlins</i>, 213 NY 240 (1914), at
    pp. 243:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not now, and never has been the law that a
    man assailed in his own dwelling, is bound to retreat.  If assailed there, he may stand his ground,
    and resist the attack.  He is under no
    duty to take to the field and the highways, a fugitive from his own home.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… In <i>Archibold’s Criminal Pleaders, Evidence and

    in the circumstances of repeated domestic assault.  In a very brief oral decision, Martin J.A. stated
    at para. 5: “</span></span><span style='line-height:

    relevance of retreat in the context of an attack in one’s own home has also been
    considered several times by the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  In <i>R.
    v. Proulx</i> (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 511, at paras. 45-46, the court referred
    to its prior case law, which established that an accused need not consider
    fleeing his or her own home when attacked there by an assailant:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=verdana>The appellant has directed us to <i>R.
    v. Jack</i> (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 446 (B.C.C.A.), a case where the accused had
    taken a stand in his home against an assailant rather than escaping out the
    back door. <i>This Court held it to be a
    reversible error for the trial judge to fail to point out that the accused was
    not required to consider fleeing from his house.</i> In <i>R. v. Irwin</i> (1994), 49 B.C.A.C. 143 this Court said much the same
    thing: that <i>if with respect to s. 34(2)
    the judge had suggested to the jury that the appellant could have escaped, then
    that would have amounted to misdirection</i>. But a fact common to both of
    these cases is that the person claiming self-defence was in his residence at
    the time of the assault.<i> The law is clear
    that flight from one's own home is not a reasonable option for self-preservation,
    and that the defence of self-defence will still apply even if there is another
    way out of the house. The rationale is that one's home is already one's last
    line of defence against an assailant.</i></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=verdana>The principle from <i>Jack</i> and <i>Irwin</i>, then, is simply that <i>within one's home one need not retreat from

    interpretation is belied by the court’s earlier unqualified statement: “<span

    phraseology such as &quot;no more force than is necessary&quot; and &quot;he
    cannot otherwise preserve himself&quot;. If there is a sensible opportunity to
    avoid further combat, that opportunity should be taken. <i>There are, of course, special rules relating to a person attacked in
    his home - the concept that &quot;a man's home is his castle&quot; pretty much
    attenuates any need to retreat in the sanctuary of one's home</i>. [Emphasis

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown relies heavily on the emphasized
    passage in support of its view that retreat may be a factor where one is
    attacked at home. I do not think that the court’s use of the phrase “pretty
    much attenuates” was intended to qualify the previous language in <i>Proulx</i>.  Indeed, at para. 24 in <i>Abdalla</i>,
    the court went on to say in regard to <i>Proulx</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finch J.A.
    (as he then was) said that, <i>aside from
    the case of persons in their own dwelling home</i>, retreat was a factor to be
    considered in self-defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further support for the view that retreating
    from one’s own home is not a factor for the jury to consider under s. 34(2) is
    found in the Supreme Court of Canada’s majority decision in <i>R. v. Lavallee</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852. In
    that case, the court considered the issue of retreat in the circumstances of a
    case of domestic abuse.  More specifically, <i>Lavallee</i> considered the s. 34(2) requirement that a person who pleads
    self-defence must believe “on reasonable grounds” that it is not possible to
    otherwise preserve him or herself from death or grievous bodily harm. Wilson J.
    for the majority referred at p. 884 to: “the obvious question ... if the
    violence was so intolerable, why did the appellant not leave her abuser long
    ago?” In answering this question at pp. 888-889, she referred to the castle
    doctrine:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=verdana><span style='color:black'>I emphasize at this juncture that it is not for the jury to
    pass judgment on the fact that an accused battered woman stayed in the
    relationship.  Still less is it entitled
    to conclude that she forfeited her right to self-defence for having done so. I
    would also point out that traditional self-defence doctrine does not require a
    person to retreat from her home instead of defending herself: <i>R. v. Antley</i> (1963), 42 C.R. 384 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  A man's home may be his castle but it is also
    the woman's home even if it seems to her more like a prison in the circumstances.</span></span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>Finally, I note that in an
    extensive article on the law of self-defence in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    titled “Applying the Law of
    Self-Defence”, (2007) 12 Can. Crim. L. Rev. 25, Professor David Paciocco reviews
    the issue of retreat.  He explains that
    while there is no duty on an accused to retreat, the failure to do so will be a
    relevant factor in resolving the success of the claim of self-defence.  He then observes, citing <i>Lavallee</i>, <i>Abdalla</i>, and <i>Boyd</i>, that retreat from one’s own home
    is not a relevant factor (at p. 57): </span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are two important limits on when retreat
    should be considered a factor in making these necessity determinations. First,
    it should not be considered to be a factor in any case unless retreat was a
    realistic option. So, where it is proved that the accused is a battered woman
    who exhibits the kind of learned helplessness that reasonably makes retreat
    seem to be an unrealistic option, the failure to retreat may not be important.<i> Second, the adage that a “man's or woman's
    home is their castle” has led courts to accept that no one is expected to
    abandon their own home in order to avoid self-defence. The failure to retreat
    from one's own home is not, therefore, a factor that can assist in determining
    whether self-defence was necessary. </i><a name=Document1zzB139334970741></a><a

    position that while retreat from one’s own home is not a necessary element to
    claiming self-defence, it may nonetheless be a factor for the jury to consider.
    By giving an instruction along the lines the Crown suggests, the danger would
    always remain that the jury would all too quickly leap from the factor of
    retreat to the inference that there is no entitlement to self-defence.  As the case law referred to above
    establishes, a jury is not entitled to consider whether an accused could have retreated
    from his or her own home in the face of an attack (or threatened attack) by an
    assailant in assessing </span></span>the
    elements of self-defence under s. 34(2). </p>

    clear to the jury. On the contrary, the jury was urged by the Crown to consider
    the appellant’s failure to retreat from his home as a factor going to the
    reasonableness of his response to the perceived attack by McNabb and the trial
    judge improperly permitted the jury to consider this option. The trial judge
    was obliged to instruct the jury that they should not consider retreat as a
    factor in determining whether the appellant’s conduct met the standard set out
    in s. 34(2).  </span></span></p>

    consider this option.  In any event, the
    appellant acknowledged in his testimony that the front door to his apartment
