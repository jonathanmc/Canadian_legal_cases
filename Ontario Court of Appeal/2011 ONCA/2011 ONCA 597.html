  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, Marie and Albert Walker, obtained a judgment against
    Sun Shelters Industries Inc., a property maintenance company, for damages
    resulting from a slip and fall accident in a parking lot.  However, Sun Shelters
    went bankrupt and could not pay the judgment.  The Walkers, therefore, brought
    an action under s. 132 of the <i>Insurance Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8,
    seeking recovery of their judgment against Sun Shelters’ insurer, the
    appellant, the Sovereign General Insurance Company.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Walkers moved for summary judgment on their claim and Sovereign
    brought a cross-motion to dismiss the action.  The main issue on the motions
    was whether Sovereign had received notice of the claim against Sun Shelters in
    accordance with the conditions of the insurance policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge, Hourigan J., held that although Sun Shelters itself
    had not given Sovereign notice of the claim, Sovereign had received notice from
    the owner of the parking lot, a co-defendant in the original action, and this
    notice complied with the policy conditions.  Alternatively, the motion judge
    held that the Walkers were entitled to relief from forfeiture under s. 129 of
    the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  Accordingly, he granted the Walkers’ motion and
    dismissed Sovereign’s cross-motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sovereign appeals on three grounds: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred in holding that the notice provision in the statutory
    conditions of the insurance policy applied to the Walkers’ claim;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred in finding that the notice given by the property
    owner was effective notice under the policy conditions for liability coverage;
    and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred in granting relief from forfeiture because such relief
    is available only for imperfect compliance with a policy condition, and not for
    what occurred here - total non-compliance.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(a)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       The accident</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On January 30, 1999, the Walkers went to a movie
    with their grandchildren at the Power Centre in Burlington, Ontario.  On the
    way back to their car after the movie was over, Marie Walker slipped on some
    ice in the parking lot and fell.  She sustained permanent injuries, including a
    serious head injury.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span
lang=EN-US>        The first action</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Walkers sued Emshih Developments Inc., the
    owner of the Power Centre, and Sun Shelters, the maintenance company retained
    to keep the property clear of ice and snow.  Emshih cross-claimed against Sun
    Shelters for contribution and indemnity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As Sun Shelters had gone bankrupt, it did not
    defend the action.  However, Emshih discovered that Sun Shelters was insured by
    Sovereign.  Emshih’s counsel notified Sovereign of the Walkers’ claim,
    forwarded all the pleadings to it, and even arranged for a lengthy adjournment
    of the trial to permit Sovereign to participate in the action.  After taking
    legal advice, Sovereign declined to participate. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Walkers settled with Emshih.  They then obtained
    a judgment against Sun Shelters for $100,000 in general damages and related
    relief.  In her reasons, Mossip J. found that “the parking lot was completely
    treacherous and unfit for use by pedestrians … that day,” that “Mrs. Walker’s
    fall was horrific,” and that “no amount of care by Mrs. Walker could likely
    have prevented her fall.”</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The second action</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Walkers then brought the action against Sovereign which is the
    subject of this appeal.  They claimed damages of $145,793.95,<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> under s. 132 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, which allows a third-party to recover
    against an insurer where its insured has failed to satisfy a judgment for
    damages. Alternatively they relied on s. 129 of the Act, which gives a court
    jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture, where there has been imperfect
    compliance with a condition in an insurance policy.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(d)       The motion judge’s
    decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In granting summary judgment to the Walkers, the
    motion judge held that because Emshih had cross-claimed against Sun Shelters,
    it may have been entitled to part of the insurance proceeds and therefore it
    had standing to give notice of the claim.  The motion judge held that under
    either of the notice provisions in the policy, Emshih’s notice was effective
    notice to Sovereign. Accordingly, the Walkers were entitled to judgment under
    s. 132 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Alternatively, the motion judge held that the
    Walkers were entitled to relief from forfeiture under s. 129 of the Act.  He
    found that “to the extent that there has been a breach of a condition, such
    breach amounts only to imperfect compliance with the policy.”  Further, he
    found no evidence of bad faith on the part of Sun Shelters, the Walkers or
    Emshih.  And finally, he found “that Sovereign has suffered no prejudice.” 
    Therefore, forfeiture would be inequitable.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 132(1) provides that a person who has a
    judgment for damages against an insured person, which  has not been satisfied,
    may recover from that person’s insurer the amount of the judgment up to the
    face value of the policy:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a person incurs a liability for injury or
    damage to the person or property of another, and is insured against such
    liability, and fails to satisfy a judgment awarding damages against the person
    in respect of the person’s liability, and an execution against the person in
    respect thereof is returned unsatisfied, the person entitled to the damages may
    recover by action against the insurer the amount of the judgment up to the face
    value of the policy, but subject to the same equities as the insurer would have
    if the judgment had been satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The concluding words of s. 132(1) – “subject to
    the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied”
    – are important.  Persons, such as the Walkers, seeking recovery under s. 132
    can stand in no better position than the insured.  So, if the insurer,
    Sovereign, had a defence against its insured, Sun Shelters, that defence would
    apply to the Walkers’ claim: see <i>W.R. Scott Equipment v. Guardian Insurance
    Co. of Canada</i> (1998), 157 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 227 (Alta. C.A.), at

    the statutory conditions of the policy requiring it to give notice and co-operate
    in the defence.  Compliance with the policy condition to give timely notice of
    a claim was a condition precedent to Sovereign’s liability to Sun Shelters. 
    Because of the non-compliance, Sovereign was not required to defend the
    original action or indemnify Sun Shelters.  It is equally not required to
    satisfy the Walkers’ claim under s. 132.</span></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>I.         Did the motion judge err in holding that s. 8 of the statutory
    conditions applied to the Walkers’ claim?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I have said, the statutory conditions, including
    s. 8, applied to “… all other perils insured by this policy.”  The motion judge
    concluded that this phrase was sufficiently broad to cover the Walkers’ loss.  Either
    the Walkers’ loss was a “peril” to which s. 8 applied or the applicability of s.
    8 to the Walkers’ loss was ambiguous, in which case the ambiguity would be
    construed against the insurer, Sovereign.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even if s. 8 did apply, Sovereign does not
    accept that Emshih could give effective notice.  However, its main submission
    is that the motion judge erred in concluding that s. 8 applied to the Walkers’
    loss.  Sovereign says that these statutory conditions apply to property losses
    such as fire and theft, but not to liability or losses to third parties.  I
    agree with this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Perhaps in isolation, the word “perils” is broad
    enough or ambiguous enough to support the motion judge’s conclusion.  But, the
    policy must be read as a whole.  And when it is read as a whole, there is no
    ambiguity.  The policy contains two separate sets of conditions.  Each set must
    be given scope and meaning.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Viewed in this light, it is apparent that the statutory
    conditions apply only to the <i>property</i> coverages in the policy – for
    example fire and theft – and any other <i>property</i> related perils that may
    be added by rider or endorsement.  Several other provisions in the statutory
    conditions support this interpretation.  For example, s. 2 dealing with “Property
    of Others,” ss. 11 and 12 dealing with “Appraisal” and “When Loss Payable,” and
    s. 13 dealing with “Replacement” have no relevance to third party liability
    claims.  They address coverage for direct loss to an insured’s property, not
    coverage for loss or liability to a third party.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The policy conditions, which follow the Comprehensive
    General Liability Coverage Rider, apply to third party liability claims such as
    the Walkers’ claim against Sun Shelters.  This is evident from the other terms
    of the rider.  The rider provides that the insured agrees, among other things,
    to the “liability insurance conditions attached to the policy and such
    additional declarations, exclusions, limitations, conditions and other terms of
    this rider.”  This provision includes the policy conditions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, the Insuring Agreement in the
    liability section of the rider states that “this policy is subject to the terms
    and conditions set forth herein.” Immediately following, it reads: “<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>see conditions on reverse side</span>.”  The
    conditions referred to are the policy conditions, which include the notice and
    duty to co-operate requirements in s. 3.  It is these conditions that apply to
    losses or liability to third parties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary, the insurance policy between
    Sovereign and Sun Shelters contains two stand alone coverages: A-C for property
    coverages, and D for liability coverage.  Each of the coverages has its own set
    of conditions.  The statutory conditions apply to the property coverages, and
    the policy conditions apply to liability coverage.  I therefore agree with
    Sovereign that the motion judge erred in holding that s. 8 of the statutory
    conditions was the notice provision applicable to the Walkers’ loss.   </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>II.         Did the motion judge err in finding that the notice

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>(a)       In the event of an accident or occurrence, written notice
    containing particulars sufficient to identify the Insured and also reasonably
    obtainable information with respect to the time, place and circumstances
    thereof, and the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses,
    shall be given promptly by or for the Insured to the Insurer or any of its

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge held that the notice of the
    Walkers’ claim given to Sovereign by Emshih’s counsel was effective notice
    under s. 3(a).  Sovereign submits that the motion judge erred in this holding. 
    It argues that only its insured, Sun Shelters, could give notice under s.
    3(a).  As Sun Shelters did not do so, it breached the policy condition. Therefore,
    in accordance with s. 4, Sovereign was not obligated to indemnify its insured
    or pay the Walkers’ judgment.  Sovereign also makes a secondary argument: Sun
    Shelters breached its duty to co-operate under s. 3(c) of the policy
    conditions.  I do not accept either of Sovereign’s arguments.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Notice under s. 3(a) can be given “by or for the
    insured.”  Thus, on the plain wording of the provision, notice may be given by
    a person other than the insured.  The section does not, however, define the
    class of persons capable of giving notice on behalf of the insured.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 3(a) should be interpreted in the light
    of its purpose. Like any notice provision in an insurance policy, the purpose
    of s. 3(a) is to make Sovereign aware of a claim against its insured so that it
    has the timely opportunity to deal with it. The delivery and content of the notice
    is important to Sovereign because the notice triggers Sovereign’s duty to
    defend and to act in good faith toward its insured. Typically, once served with
    notice, Sovereign will have to open a file, retain an adjuster, and take any
    other steps necessary to respond to the claim against its insured. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given its purpose and importance, if the notice
    is to be given for an insured instead of by the insured itself, the person
    giving it should have sufficient proximity to the claim to have knowledge of
    the information required by s. 3(a).  Emshih was just such a person. It owned
    the property where the accident occurred; it was a defendant in the original
    action; and it cross-claimed against Sovereign’s insured. In giving notice to
    Sovereign, Emshih was giving notice <i>for</i> Sun Shelters as contemplated by
    s. 3(a) of the policy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the very least, the class of persons capable
    of giving notice under s. 3(a) is ambiguous.  In accordance with well accepted
    principles of interpretation of insurance contracts, that ambiguity must be
    construed against Sovereign: see <i>Consolidated-Bathurst v. Mutual Boiler</i>,
    [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888.  Therefore, I agree with the motion judge that Emshih’s
    notice was effective notice to Sovereign under s. 3(a) of the policy conditions
    for liability coverage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge also found “the argument that
    Sun Shelters failed to co-operate in the defence of the original action is
    entirely without merit.”  This is a finding of fact, which is supported by the
    record and warrants deference on appeal.  As the motion judge noted, Sovereign
    made no effort to contact its insured or seek its assistance in defending the
    action.  Instead, it took the position that it would not participate in the
    action at all.  It cannot now complain that Sun Shelters breached its duty to
    co-operate.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My disposition of the second issue is sufficient
    to decide this appeal.  However, even if I am wrong in holding that Emshih
    could give notice under s. 3(a) of the policy conditions for liability
    coverage, I agree with the motion judge that the Walkers would, be entitled to
    relief from forfeiture under s. 129 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 129 provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where there has been imperfect compliance with a
    statutory condition as to the proof of loss to be given by the insured or other
    matter or thing required to be done or omitted by the insured with respect to
    the loss and a consequent forfeiture or avoidance of the insurance in whole or
    in part and the court considers it inequitable that the insurance should be forfeited
    or avoided on that ground, the court may relieve against the forfeiture or
    avoidance on such terms as it considers just.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>Relief from forfeiture under s. 129 applies both
    to statutory and policy conditions: see <i>Falk Bros. Industries Ltd. v. Elance

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The two issues under this ground of appeal are:
    first, whether this is a case of imperfect compliance, as the Walkers maintain,
    or total non-compliance, as Sovereign maintains; and second, if this is a case

    inequitable. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The law has treated the failure to give timely
    notice of a claim as imperfect compliance, not non-compliance: see <i>Falk
    Bros. Industries Ltd. v. Elance Steel Fabricating Co.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 18.  However, Sovereign submits that this principle does not apply on
    these facts.  It says that because Emshih was not entitled to give notice under
    s. 3(a) of the policy conditions for liability coverage, then in substance no
    notice was given, rendering this a case of non-compliance, not imperfect
    compliance.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It seems to me that Sovereign’s position is far
    too rigid.  As I said earlier, the question of compliance has to be looked at
    in the light of the purpose of a timely notice provision.  Notice gives the
    insurer an opportunity to investigate the merits of a claim, negotiate a
    settlement, and if necessary, defend the action.  Sovereign had that
    opportunity.  It chose not to exercise it.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In other words, this is not a case where the
    insured had no actual notice of the claim or loss - Sovereign did have actual
    notice and made a conscious decision not to participate in the litigation. 
    Even if the notice should have come from Sun Shelters, the notice from Emshih
    makes this a case of imperfect compliance, not non-compliance.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As this is a case of imperfect compliance, the
    only remaining question under s. 129 is whether forfeiture of the insurance
    proceeds would be inequitable.  The motion judge held that it would be, and
    made two key findings of fact in support of that holding:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was no bad faith by Sun Shelters, the

    Walkers’ claim over five years after the accident occurred, Sovereign suffered
    no prejudice from the late delivery of the notice.  In the motion judge’s
    words: “Whether the insurer received notice six months or six years after the
    accident it is difficult to imagine that it would have acted any differently.”</span></p>
