style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave four reasons for finding that the appellants
    evidence was not credible.  His first, and arguably main reason, was that the
    appellant was not forthright about the extent of his criminal record.  Indeed,
    the trial judge found that the appellant deliberately failed to disclose his
    complete record.  In our view, this was not a fair or tenable basis for rejecting
    the appellants evidence because of the way the criminal record was put into
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is often the case, defence counsel led the record at the beginning of
    his clients evidence.  Defence counsel obtained the record from the Crown. 
    The record he obtained, however, was not complete because it did not contain
    the appellants three most recent convictions: one for impaired driving and two
    for breach of recognizance.  Defence counsel said that he was going to have his
    client admit the record.  He asked the appellant whether the record accurately
    reflects your criminal record.  The appellant said yes it does.  Of course
    it did not.  That it did not emerged in cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant volunteered that he had not yet moved out of the house
    because he was waiting for his licence suspension to end, the Crown asked
    whether the suspension was as a result of a criminal conviction.  The appellant
    readily admitted that he had recently been convicted for impaired driving. 
    Later, in response to questions from the Crown, the appellant admitted that he
    had been guilty of two breaches of recognizance.  As we read the record, in
    neither of these instances was the appellant being evasive or deliberately
    trying to hide his record.  That the record handed to him in his
    examination-in-chief was incomplete, appears to have been due to an inadvertent
    error by both Crown and defence counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of this context in which the appellants criminal record
    was introduced, the trial judge was not justified in using it to make an
    adverse credibility finding.  The trial judge did give other reasons for
    rejecting the appellants evidence.  However, his error in finding that the
    appellants initial mistake and acknowledgement of his record was not innocent
    irretrievably tainted his credibility finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For that reason alone, the convictions cannot stand.  Accordingly, the
    appeal is allowed, the convictions are set aside and a new trial is ordered.  </p>
