    ownership of surplus pension funds been changed by <i>Burke v. Hudson’s Bay Co.</i>,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span

    as I explain below, I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND IN BRIEF</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Effective December 28, 1971, Simpsons Limited
    (Simpsons) established a defined benefit pension plan for its employees (the
    Simpsons pension plan).  Initially, only Simpsons made contributions to the
    Simpsons pension plan.  However, starting in 1976, Simpsons’ employees also
    began contributing to it.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Simpsons pension plan was amended a number
    of times.  It ultimately became the defined benefit component of the Dumai
    Pension Plan.  For convenience, when referring to the pension plan from
    inception as the Simpsons pension plan up to and including its current form as
    the defined benefit component of the Dumai Pension Plan, I will refer to it as
    the Plan.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The original Simpsons pension plan text was
    adopted in 1971 (the original Plan Text).  It was subsequently amended and restated
    a number of times.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    The relevant Plan provisions are reproduced in the following section of these
    reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The assets of the Simpsons pension plan were
    held in a trust fund.  The trust was established and originally governed by an agreement
    between Simpsons and Canada Permanent Trust Company dated December 28, 1971
    (the original Trust Agreement).  The original Trust Agreement went through a
    number of changes.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    and added a defined contribution component to it.  It made approximately 8,000
    Zellers employees, members of the defined contribution component of the
    Simpsons pension plan, on a “go-forward” basis.  It was at this time that the
    name of the Simpsons pension plan was changed to the Dumai Pension Plan. </span></p>

    31, 2007, the trial judge ruled, among other things, that: the Plan assets are
    impressed with a trust in favour of the Plan members; HBC is not a beneficiary
    of the trust; and, on Plan termination, the Plan members are entitled to any
    surplus assets in the trust fund.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs (hereafter referred to as the respondents) appealed and
    HBC cross-appealed.  The appeal was abandoned, leaving only the cross-appeal to
    be decided.  In it, HBC – relying on <i>Burke – </i>challenges the trial judge’s
    conclusions that it (HBC) is neither a beneficiary of the Plan nor entitled to
    any surplus assets remaining on Plan termination.       </p>

    appeal: did the trial judge err in concluding that HBC is not a beneficiary of
    the trust fund and not entitled to surplus assets in the trust fund on Plan

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            A Preliminary Matter</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before turning to the merits of this matter, I
    will briefly address the respondents’ argument that HBC is estopped from seeking
    a declaration that it is a beneficiary of the trust fund and entitled to
    surplus on Plan termination.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents point to HBC’s factum at trial
    to show that below, HBC argued that there was no need to decide the issue of
    surplus ownership on Plan termination.  They say that HBC is using the
    cross-appeal to seek such a declaration for the first time and contend that it
    ought not to be permitted to change its position on cross-appeal.       </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I reject this submission for two reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, it is important to recognize that this is
    not a situation in which HBC is attempting to raise a new issue on appeal.  The
    question of whether HBC was a beneficiary of the trust was squarely in play at
    trial.  In fact, the first certified common issue at trial was whether the Plan
    assets were impressed with a trust and, if so, in favour of which
    beneficiaries.  In deciding this issue, the trial judge expressly considered
    whether HBC was a beneficiary of the trust fund.    Furthermore, HBC’s position
    at trial, albeit in the alternative, was that it was entitled to surplus on
    Plan termination.  The trial judge makes this point at para. 134 of his
    reasons, in which he recites HBC’s position on the first common issue as consisting
    of two elements: that it was unnecessary to determine the matter but, in any
    event, that it (HBC) is entitled to surplus on Plan termination.       </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, and in any event, it would be improper
    to permit this submission to succeed at this point in the proceeding.  By
    endorsement dated August 6, 2008 (the Decision), Juriansz J.A. (in chambers) granted
    HBC an extension of time in which to file its notice of cross-appeal.  The
    respondents did not seek to have the Decision reviewed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>  In granting the extension, Juriansz J.A. noted
    that this is an evolving area of law and the interests of justice warrant
    having the issue raised on the cross-appeal decided by this court.  That is, the
    Decision gave HBC an extension of time so that it could pursue the cross-appeal
    and have the issue it raises decided on the merits.  If the court were to
    accede to the respondents’ submission, the result would be that it would refuse
    to decide the cross-appeal on its merits.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Consequently, in my view, the respondents’
    submission amounts to a collateral attack on the Decision.  Court orders are to
    be treated as binding unless they are set aside on appeal or lawfully quashed:
    see <i>R. v. Wilson</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, at pp. 599-600.  As it would be
    improper to permit the Decision to be attacked collaterally, the cross-appeal
    should be decided on its merits.           </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS</span></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>            <b><i>HBC’s Position</i></b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>HBC’s submission is based largely on the Supreme
    Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Burke</i>.  To avoid confusion, recall that
    HBC was the respondent in the <i>Burke </i>case.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Burke</i>, the Supreme Court held that the
    employees had no equitable interest in surplus on plan termination and,
    therefore, no equitable interest in the actuarial surplus while the pension
    plan was ongoing.  Based on this determination, HBC says that <i>Burke </i>establishes
    that it (HBC) is entitled to any surplus assets that remain on the termination
    and wind up of the pension plan.  HBC contends that the language in the Plan documents
    in the present case is, in all material respects, identical to that in <i>Burke.  </i>Therefore, HBC submits, just as it was entitled to surplus in <i>Burke</i>,
    so too it is entitled to surplus in the present case.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In furtherance of this general submission, HBC alleges
    that the trial judge erred in three specific ways.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, HBC submits that the trial judge erred in
    concluding that the original Trust Agreement required that any surplus on Plan
    termination was to be paid to Plan members.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, HBC argues that the trial judge erred in
    failing to find that the surplus reversion language in s. 16.02 of the original
    Plan Text “trumped” the general language in arts. 2 and 11(ii) of the original
    Trust Agreement.  HBC says that when the original Plan Text and the original
    Trust Agreement are read together, it is clear that the original Plan Text was
    intended to be the dominant document.  Hence, the argument runs, s. 16.02 of
    the original Plan Text “trumps” any competing language in the original Trust
    Agreement.  Further, HBC says, the trial judge misread art. 11(ii) of the
    original Trust Agreement by erroneously equating the termination of the
    original Trust Agreement with the termination of the Plan.  The original Trust Agreement
    could be terminated (and was in 1984) without terminating the Plan by the
    decision to appoint a new trustee or to use a different funding vehicle to hold
    the Plan assets.  When the original Trust Agreement – but not the Plan or the
    fund – was terminated, art. 11(ii) applied. If, however, the Plan as a whole
    had been terminated, the more specific terms of art. 12 would have been
    applicable. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, HBC contends, the trial judge erred by negating
    the terms of art. 12 of the original Trust Agreement and s. 16.02 of the
    original Plan Text, which was incorporated by reference into the original Trust
    Agreement.  This argument runs as follows.  When the original Trust Agreement is
    read in its entirety, including the terms incorporated by reference from the
    original Plan Text, it is apparent that the exclusive benefit language in arts.
    2 and 11 of the original Trust Agreement was intended to apply only to the use
    of the trust fund in the ongoing Plan, not to the use of the trust fund on Plan
    termination.  The use of funds on Plan termination was specifically dealt with
    in art. 12 of the original Trust Agreement and in terms of the Plan text
    incorporated by reference into it.  Those terms permitted HBC to receive any
    surplus in the Plan, if and when it was terminated.   </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In conclusion, HBC submits, on a proper reading
    of the original Plan documents, the Company was entitled to surplus from the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trust will generally extend to surplus but
    an employer may explicitly limit the operation of the trust so that it does not

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The employer, as settlor of the trust, may
    reserve a power to revoke the trust.  To be effective, that power must be

lang=EN-US>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Surplus funds on plan termination and wind up may
    be subject to a resulting trust.  Before a resulting trust can arise, it must
    be clear that all of the objectives of the trust have been fully satisfied.  Even
    when that is done, the employer cannot claim the benefit of a resulting trust if
    the terms of the pension plan demonstrate an intention to part outright with
    all money contributed to the pension fund.  In contributory plans, it is not
    only the employer’s but also the employees’ intentions that must be considered
    – both are settlors of the trust.     </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Catalytic plan and trust agreement
    established a trust for the benefit of a defined group of persons (paras.
    97-99).  The trust had never been terminated and so continued to exist (para.
    100).  Air Products could only claim the surplus by means of a resulting trust
    or according to the terms of the trust itself (para. 102).  No resulting trust
    could arise because the purposes of the trust were not fully satisfied by the
    payment of all defined benefits.  One of the objects of the trust was to use any
    money in the trust fund for the benefit of the employees (para. 102).  This
    objective could be implied from the “exclusive benefit” and “non-diversion”
    clauses contained in the original trust agreement (para. 103).  The trust
    objects could never be exhausted so long as some money remained in the fund and
    some eligible employees could be found (para. 105).</span></p>

    surplus only under the terms of the trust (para. 106).  The validity of the
    amendments to the trust which purported to give surplus to Air Products depended
    on the terms of the original trust agreement (para. 108).  The original trust
    agreement contained the following provision:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Applying these same steps, Cory J. explained why
    Air Products was entitled to the surplus attributable to the Stearns plan.  The
    funds for the Stearns plan were not subject to a trust.  Its funding vehicle
    was a group annuity policy with the Mutual Life Assurance Company. 
    Furthermore, all relevant versions of the Stearns plan gave the employer

    that the first step in determining surplus entitlement is a careful historical
    review of the Plan documentation.  It is important to start with the
    originating documents because, as we see from <i>Schmidt </i>itself, plan and
    trust amendments may not be valid. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is readily apparent that the pension fund in
    the current case is impressed with a trust – see art. 2 of the original Trust
    Agreement, which establishes the trust fund, and s. 13.01 of the original Plan

    purposes of the Plan.  Accordingly, the second step in <i>Schmidt </i>does not

lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The fourth step in <i>Schmidt </i>requires the
    court to determine whether the employer explicitly limited the operation of the
    trust so that it does not apply to surplus. Again, it is abundantly clear in
    the present case that there is no such limitation: the trust explicitly extends
    to the surplus.  Article 2 of the original Trust Agreement provides that the
    trust fund is comprised of “all cash and property … now and hereafter received
    by [the trustee] in trust for the purposes of the Plan, together with all …
    income and profits arising therefrom”.</span></p>

    whether the employer reserved a power of revocation at the time the trust was
    created.  Only an express power of revocation is sufficient.  In this case, no such

    clear, the power of revocation cannot be implied from the general power of

    is to be paid to the Plan members.  The third alleged error was that arts. 2

    Plan, not to its use on Plan termination as the trial judge found.  There is no
    such limiting language in arts. 2 and 11.  In this regard it is worthy of note
    that the exclusive benefit language in arts. 2 and 11 of the original Trust

    show an intention that surplus on termination is to go to the Company.  In any

    original Trust Agreement because the Plan documents show an intention that the
    original Plan Text was to be the dominant document.  Further, HBC says the

    11 gives the Company the right to change, modify or terminate the original Trust
    Agreement.  However, clause (ii) of art. 11 is not limited to the termination
    of the original Trust Agreement – it governs any and all modifications to the
    trust.  Article 11(ii) stipulates that no change, modification or termination shall
    “authorize or permit or result in any part of the corpus or income of the Trust
    Fund” being used other than for the exclusive benefit of Plan members and their
    beneficiaries.  There is nothing in the exclusive benefit language in art. 11

    Air Products the right to amend the plan and the trust agreement, provided that
    no amendment authorized or permitted any part of the trust fund to be used
    other than for the exclusive benefit of the plan beneficiaries.  In <i>Schmidt</i>,
    as we have seen, the exclusive benefit language in art. V of the trust
    agreement led the Supreme Court to conclude that the intention was that the
    object of the trust was to use the money for the employees and that the trust
    objects could never be exhausted so long as money remained in the fund and some
    eligible employees could be found.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The exclusive benefit language in art. 11 of the

    conclusion: that the intention was that the object of the trust was to use the
    money for the employees and the trust objects cannot be exhausted so long as
    money remains in the pension fund and some eligible employees can be found. 
    Indeed, the scope of art. 11 in the present case is even broader and more all encompassing
    than that of art. V of the Catalytic trust agreement.  Where art. V addressed
    only amendments, art. 11 covers any change, modification or termination.  And,
    where art. V of the Catalytic trust agreement prohibited any amendment that
    should “authorize or permit” any part of the trust fund to be used other than
    for the exclusive benefit of employees, art. 11 of the original Trust Agreement
    expands the prohibition.  Article 11 stipulates – in addition to that which is
    prohibited by art. V – that no change, modification or termination can “result
    in any part of the corpus or income of the Trust Fund” being used other than
    for the exclusive benefit of the employees.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A careful review of the facts in <i>Schmidt </i>reinforces
    the conclusion that art. 11 extends to cover any changes to the trust fund and
    not merely changes to the trust agreement.  In <i>Schmidt</i>, the Catalytic
    trust agreement was established in 1959.  The trust agreement was actually
    brought to an end in 1974 when the Company transferred control of the pension
    fund to Confederation Life Insurance Company, pursuant to the terms of an
    investment contract (para. 100).  Despite the ending of the trust agreement,
    the Supreme Court held that the trust was never terminated and the monies in
    the trust fund continued to be impressed with a trust in favour of the
    employees (para. 102).  Put another way, <i>Schmidt </i>tells us that where an
    irrevocable trust in favour of employees has been established, the ending of
    the trust agreement does not signify the end of the trust.  Thus, in the
    present case, while art. 11 of the original Trust Agreement gave the Company
    the right to terminate the agreement, in light of the exclusive benefit
    language in clause (ii) of that provision, it did much more than that: it
    created an irrevocable trust in favour of the Plan members and beneficiaries, a
    conclusion that is reinforced by the concluding clause of art. 2 of the
    original Trust Agreement.                  </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the opportunity to read the reasons of my colleague and respectfully
    disagree.  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the cross-appeal, set
    aside that portion of the judgment finding that HBC is not a beneficiary of the
    trust fund of the Plan, and substitute an order that under the plan and trust
    documentation, as currently worded, HBC is entitled to the surplus, if any,
    remaining upon discontinuance of the plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I will
    explain, when read together there is no conflict between the two documents. The
    combined effect of Article 12 of the original Trust Agreement and s. 16.02 of
    the original Plan Text is to clearly entitle HBC to the surplus.  This is not a
    case like <i>Schmidt, </i>where the company attempted to create a right to the
    surplus through amending documents; rather, as was the case in <i>Burke, </i>HBC’s
    right to the surplus was clearly established by the original Plan and Trust
    Agreements.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan
    and Trust Agreements must be read together; this much is beyond dispute.  The
    pension trust does not stand alone.  The two agreements are inseparable and
    together form an integrated whole: see <i>Buschau v. Rogers Communication Inc.</i>,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. 973, at paras. 29 and 90.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a
    matter of contractual interpretation, both documents must be interpreted in a
    manner that, if possible, avoids conflict and gives effect to all provisions:
    see <i>Bundy of Canada Ltd. v. Canada Trust Co.</i> (1997), 17 C.C.P.B. 12
    (Ont. C.A.), at para. 3; <i>Chitty on Contracts</i>, 29<sup>th</sup> ed.

    2006), at 457. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Above and
    beyond these well established principles of interpretation, it is abundantly
    clear in the present case that the Plan and Trust Agreement must be read
    together as each document explicitly refers to and incorporates the text of the
    other. Article 1 of the original Trust Agreement expressly states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>ARTICLE 1.</u> The Plan as annexed and exhibited
    hereto, and as amended from time to time, shall form part of this Agreement to
    the same extent as if all of its provisions were fully set forth herein and the
    definitions and meanings of the words and terms as used in the Plan shall have
    the same meanings herein unless the context indicates otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>In unambiguous terms, this provision requires the Plan
    and Trust Agreements to be treated as if they were one self-contained document. </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>II.        <u>When read together there is no conflict between the
    documents</u></span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>(a) <u>The original
    agreements give HBC the express right to the surplus</u></span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    inception, the original documents have given HBC the express right to the
    surplus. Article 12 of the Trust Agreement provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Article
    12.</span></u> In the event of the discontinuance of the Plan the Trustee shall
    dispose of the Trust Fund as directed in writing by the Company in accordance
    with the provisions of the Plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan
    text further provides in s. 16.02:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>16.02  Amendment to or suspension of all or part of
    the Plan shall not operate to reduce any benefits which have accrued under the
    Plan prior to the date of such amendment or suspensions, as the case may be, to
    Members of the Plan.  <b><i>In the event that the Plan is terminated, no part
    of the assets of the Plan shall revert to the benefit of the Company <u>until</u> provision has been made for all pensions and other benefits in respect of
    service up to the date of such termination to Members of the Plan and for all
    benefits to former employees and pensioners. </i></b>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Though in
    most cases a trust will extend to any surplus, a settlor may reserve the right
    to the surplus, if this is clearly done at the time the trust is created (<i>Schmidt, </i>at p. 655). Keeping in mind that Article 1 requires the Plan and Trust
    Agreements to be treated as one document, the effect of the above provisions is
    to do just that – to create an express entitlement in favour of HBC to the
    surplus on termination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    provisions existed from the outset.  As a result, therefore, HBC had reserved
    the right to direct payment to itself of those portions of the Trust Fund that
    upon termination of the Plan are not required to fund the benefits of the
    members of the Plan, from the outset.  In my view, Article 12 of the Trust
    Agreement is central to this appeal and the interpretation of the agreements
    adopted by my colleague simply does not give full effect to it.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(b) <u>There is no conflicting
    provision vesting all of the trust funds, including the surplus to the members</u></span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acknowledging
    that equity dictates that the trust agreement must prevail in the event of a
    conflict between trust and plan agreements, there is no such conflict in the
    present case. At its highest, the “exclusive benefit” language found in
    Articles 2 &amp; 11 of the Trust Agreement refers to use of the actual funds in
    the ongoing plan; however, on termination, when the plan ceases to exist and a
    surplus may arise, Article 12 and s. 16.02 determine how those funds may be
    used, to wit, “as directed in writing by the Company in accordance with the
    provisions of the Plan.” In any event, as I will explain, the “exclusive
    benefit” language in Articles 2 and 11 of the Trust Agreement is of limited
    application and does not purport as to confer on the Plan members a general
    entitlement to the Trust Fund.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i) <u>At
    its highest, the “exclusive benefit” language refers to the use of the funds
    during the Plan’s existence – not on termination</u></span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    13.01 of the Plan and Article 2(a) of the Trust Agreement provide that the
    Trust was established to receive and hold funds for the purposes of the Plan. 
    It is also clear from both the text of the Trust Agreement and the text of the
    Plan that for as long as the Plan remains in existence that “purpose” is to
    hold funds in the Trust so as to ensure that the benefits to which the members
    of the Plan are entitled will be paid.  There are clear limits as to the type
    of payments the trustees can make.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, on
    termination when the surplus, if any, arises, the Trust Agreement provides that
    a different regime applies.  Article 12 and s. 16.02 provide that in the sole
    event of termination the trust fund is to be paid out “as directed in writing
    by the Company [HBC] in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is only
    upon termination of the Plan that a surplus is created.  It is, therefore,
    neither surprising nor inappropriate for a trust agreement to provide that a
    different regime applies in the event of a plan’s termination. Before
    termination there is no surplus and “neither the employer nor the employees
    have a specific interest in this amount, since it only exists on paper” (<i>Schmidt, </i>at p. 654). At any rate, as I have set out below, the “exclusive benefit”
    referred to in Articles 2 and 11 is of limited scope.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii) <u>The
    interpretation of Articles 2 and 11 does not confer an entitlement to the
    surplus on the Plan members</u></span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support
    of her conclusion that the Plan members are entitled to the surplus on
    termination, my colleague interprets Article 11 of the Trust Agreement, as
    reinforced by Article 2 of that Agreement, as demonstrating HBC’s intention to
    establish an irrevocable trust for the exclusive benefit of Plan members and
    their beneficiaries.  For the reasons that follow, I do not interpret these
    articles as demonstrating HBC’s intention to go as far as conferring an
    entitlement on the Plan members to the surplus in the event of the Plan’s
    discontinuance.  Such an interpretation would have the effect of rendering
    nugatory the clear wording of Article 12.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Interpreting
    Article 11</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article 11
    appears in the original Trust Agreement. It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u><span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>Article 11.</span></u>  The Company shall have
    the right at any time or by or pursuant to a resolution of its Board of
    Directors to change or modify by amendment any of the provisions of, and to
    terminate, this Agreement provided it shall first have given written notice of
    such amendment or termination to the Trustee and provided that –</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i) if any such amendment appears to the
    Trustee to effect the rights, duties or responsibilities of the Trustee, the
    Trustee may assent to such amendment by executing an agreement supplementary hereto
    or, failing to assent, the Trustee shall resign as provided in Article 9
    hereof.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii) such change,
    modification or termination shall not authorize or permit or result in any part
    of the corpus or income of the Trust Fund being used for or diverted to
    purposes other than for the benefit exclusively of mebers [<i>sic</i>] of the
    Plan and their beneficiaries and for the payment of fees, expenses, taxes and
    other assessments as provided in Article 2 hereof unless with the approval of
    the Minister of National Revenue and such other governmental authority having
    governmental jurisdiction over the Plan or Fund.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    provision gives HBC the right to change, modify or terminate the Trust
    Agreement.  However, Article 11(ii) is not a right granting provision.  It is a
    provision that limits HBC’s ability to make changes.  It provides that any
    change, modification or termination made by HBC cannot affect the existing
    rights or entitlements of the Plan members. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read in
    context, this provision is neither a vesting provision nor does it conflict
    with Article 12 of the Trust Agreement and s. 16.02 of the Plan.  Article 12
    and s. 16.02 existed in the original texts and the rights they conferred on HBC
    were not the product of a “change, modification or termination” of the Trust Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Burke</i>,
    Rothstein J. specifically rejected the submission that an identically worded
    Article 11(ii) conferred any entitlement to the Plan members that they did not
    previously have.  At para. 78 he stated:<i> </i> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Article 11(ii) is addressed to changes.  In other
    words, the “benefit exclusively of members” language must be read in the
    context of what the employees were entitled to before any change.  The
    entitlements before any change were the defined benefits.  No change may result
    in the funds being used other than for those defined benefits, except as
    specified.  The provision does not confer on employees an additional
    entitlement they did not previously have.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other
    words, Article 11(ii) does not define the benefits; it simply provides that
    changes to the Trust Agreement cannot reduce those benefits that the members
    already have.  If the Trust Agreement does contain a provision granting the
    Plan members the right to the surplus, so as to trump the combined effect of
    Article 12 and s. 16.02, that right must be found elsewhere in the documents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is
    not, therefore, a case of deciding which provision governs, Article 11 or
    Article 12.  It is a case of reading all of the provisions in the Trust
    Agreement and the Plan together in a manner that if possible avoids conflict
    and gives effect to all of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article 11
    deals with amendments or termination of the Trust Agreement.  There can, of
    course be many amendments or terminations.  As noted by my colleague, there has
    already been at least one termination of the Trust Agreement.  There will
    however, be only one termination of the Plan.  It is only upon the termination
    of the Plan that a surplus may be created and that a “specific interest” in the
    surplus is created.  This unique event is precisely what Article 12 of the
    Trust Agreement and s. 16.02 of the Plan provide for.</p>

lang=EN-US>My colleague reads the paragraph that appears at the end of Article

    that if the final paragraph is read as qualifying subparagraph (a) of Article

lang=EN-US>As in <i>Burke</i>, in the present case there are provisions

    upon termination of the Plan “if any balance of the Trust Fund shall remain
    after the satisfaction of all obligations of the plan … such balance shall be
    paid to the Company.”  Article 12 of the Trust Agreement and s. 16.02 of the
    Plan, though structured slightly different than Article 12.025 of <i>Burke</i>,
    have precisely the same effect.  They provide that if the Plan is terminated,
    HBC can direct how the Trust Fund is to be disposed of subject only to the
    limitation contained in s.&nbsp;16.02 of the Plan - the same limitation as
    Article 12.025 of <i>Burke</i>,  that “no part of the assets of the Plan shall
    revert to the benefit of the Company [HBC] until provision has been made for
    all pensions and other benefits in respect of service up to the date of such
    termination to members of the Plan and for all benefits to former employees and

    I disagree.  The texts are the same.  The fact that they were added to the
    Trust Agreement by way of an amendment in <i>Burke</i> is not a basis to give
    the same provisions different meaning in the circumstances of this case. 
    Agreements, whether the product of amendments or not must be read as a whole. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In <i>Burke</i> the provisions were interpreted in the manner they
    were so as not to conflict with the originating documents which gave the
    company a right to the surplus. The amending documents had to be read in light
    of the originating documents; they had to be read as a <u>whole.</u>  Because
    the originating documents gave the company an express right to the surplus, if
    the amendments were to limit that right they would have had to have done so

lang=EN-US>The case at bar presents a similar situation.  The “exclusive
    benefit” language contained in Articles 2 and 11 has to be read in light of the
    whole document.  By virtue of Article 1 of the Trust Agreement the whole
    document is the sum total of the original Plan and Trust Agreements.  These two
    agreements must be read to avoid conflict and give meaning to <u>all</u> of the
    provisions contained therein - they must be read as whole.  The interpretation
    of these provisions favoured by my colleague does not treat the documents as a
    cohesive whole; rather, it leaves Article 12 and s. 16.02 without purpose and
    meaning. Such a result is not in keeping with basic rules of contractual
    interpretation and could not have been intended by the settlor.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree
    with my colleague that <i>Schmidt </i>laid down the foundational principles
    through which courts are to determine questions of surplus ownership.  I also
    agree that <i>Burke</i> has not changed that law.  However, because s. 16.02 of
    the Plan and Article 12 of the Trust Agreement expressly deal with what is to
    happen to the Trust Fund in the event of the Plan’s termination and none of the
    other provisions in the two documents conflict with this directive, the
    intention of the settlor of the Trust is clear.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Schmidt,</i> therefore, can be distinguished on the facts. In <i>Schmidt</i> the original
    plan and trust documents created no entitlement to the surplus in favour of the
    company.  It was only through later amendments to the Trust and Plan documents
    that the company purported to give itself a right to the surplus.  In <i>Schmidt</i>,
    the court found that these later amendments were an attempt to partially revoke
    a trust originally established for the exclusive benefit of the employees (at
    p. 662).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast to <i>Schmidt</i>, the Trust Agreement in the present case provided
    from the very outset that upon termination of the Plan, HBC could direct how
    the Trust Fund would be paid out subject only to the limitation in the Plan
    that the benefits of the Plan members be provided for.  The intention of the
    settlor of the trust is clear.  After provision is made for the benefits of the
    members, HBC can at its discretion direct the trustees to pay the surplus to
    HBC.  The payment of the surplus to HBC was thus provided for in the original
    text. This right to direct payment has been a part of the objects of the Trust
    from the outset, albeit only in the singular event of the Plan’s termination.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    view, therefore, the original Trust Agreement and Plan entitled HBC to the
    surplus.  None of the subsequent amendments have impeded or removed that
    right.  As the Plan is ongoing and the Plan and Trust Agreement can be amended
    before termination, the present decision only applies to the Plan and Trust

lang=EN-US>In conclusion, I would allow the cross-appeal and set aside that
    portion of the judgment ordering that HBC is not a beneficiary of the Trust
    Fund of the Plan and substitute an order declaring that under the Trust and
    Plan Agreements as presently worded, HBC would be entitled to any surplus if
    the Plan were terminated as of the date of the hearing of the action.  I would
    also order that, if the parties are unable to resolve the matter of costs, they
    are to make brief written submission on the matter and such submissions are to
    be received by the court within 15 days of the release of these reasons.</span></p>
