    Justice, the appellant was convicted on September 29, 2008 of the following
    offences:</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Luring a child under the age of 14 for the purpose of

    sentence he received. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both his
    appeal against conviction and his appeal against sentence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW OF FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The basic facts are not in dispute. In September
    2006, the complainant was 12 years old and lived with her parents. She had a
    cellular telephone through which she could access the internet using a mobile
    browser.  One mobile website she accessed was known as Airdate. Among other
    features, the Airdate site provided the complainant with access to various chat
    rooms, as well as to a “private inbox” where messages could be received without
    being visible to other users of the site.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In late August or early September 2006, the
    complainant received a message in her private inbox. The source turned out to
    be the appellant, who was then aged 30. He wanted to know if the complainant
    would sleep with him in exchange for $57 million. The complainant did not
    reply. Soon after, she received another similar message from the appellant, in
    which he identified himself by a fictitious name and pretended to be much
    younger (between 18 and 20 years of age) than he was. He asked the complainant
    to send him a text message if she changed her mind about sleeping with him. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant became curious and sent a text
    message to the phone number the appellant had provided.  And so began a series
    of text messages back and forth, numbering in the hundreds, that culminated in
    a meeting between the appellant and the complainant several days later. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the course of trading text messages, the
    appellant gained the complainant’s trust by letting her discuss her personal
    life and her friends at school. He also talked to her about sex acts he wanted
    to perform with her. For example, he wanted to know if she had “ever performed
    oral” and he asked her “to give him oral”. She agreed to do so. He also talked
    about performing oral sex on her, which she did not fully understand. Finally,
    he wanted to take her virginity. The complainant informed the appellant that
    she was only 12 years old (she had initially led him to believe that she was
    14). The appellant told the complainant that her age did not really matter. He
    said that he was “experienced” and that he knew “how to do that really good so
    that she would have a good time for her first time.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Throughout their text messaging, the appellant
    kept increasing the sum of money he was prepared to pay the complainant if she
    would meet with him and have sex. According to the complainant, the sum went
    from $57 million to $100 million, and then to $200 million. In her mind, the
    appellant was raising the amount to “kind of convince” her to go and meet him. She
    initially did not believe that he had that kind of money. However, she listened
    in on a three-way conversation and heard a message, purportedly from someone at
    the Bank of Montreal, indicating that the appellant had $300 million in his
    account. This caused the complainant to change her mind about the appellant’s
    financial status. It also influenced her decision to meet with him, as her
    family was experiencing serious financial problems at the time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With the promise that she would be paid a large
    sum of money, the complainant agreed to meet the appellant on a particular day
    after school at a predetermined location. Upon her arrival, the appellant led the
    complainant to an industrial area near some railway tracks. He then used his
    cell phone to call the Bank of Montreal. With the complainant listening, he
    made it appear as though he were transferring millions of dollars into an
    account in her name. In fact, he had contacted a recorded voice-message that the
    bank had installed to teach customers how to use the bank’s automated telephone

    cell phone to the cell tower which is like an antennae and then from there,
    you’re routing through a network to the home switch of the cellular phone which

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        No, it’s not in the
    tower. It’s at a location, we call them central offices.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        Okay.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        In Ontario, there’s four
    locations for these central offices and in these four, four different
    locations, there’s, there’s one in Cambridge, there’s one in Scarborough, one
    in Etobicoke and… in Ottawa. And that’s where the programming for all the cell
    phones are. So it goes from the cell phone to the antennae or tower and from
    there, it’s going through a network to the switch, the telephone switch, which
    is like a computer, like I said.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        And then from the
    switch, where does it go?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        It depends on the type

    the connection with whatever phone number was dialed.</span></p>

    performed by the computer programs that transmit the data contained in the text

    this evidence addressed the “control” function and she did not pursue that
    issue. She did, however, argue for the first time that Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Vanderklugt’s
    evidence in relation to the “logic function” should be viewed as worthless and
    given no weight because he could not give a simple example of what he meant by
    the “logic function”. Counsel argued that his inability to do so underscores
    his lack of knowledge and understanding of computer programs in general and the

    computers was “all the software” that provides “checks and balances” and is
    responsible for checking all the routing of cellular calls and text messages. While
    Mr. Vanderklugt’s evidence may not have been particularly helpful in giving a
    specific example of what is meant by a logic function, it is beyond controversy
    that all computer software programs follow basic logic functions. It was not
    necessary for Mr. Vanderklugt to give a specific example of a logic function. The
    fact that the voluminous text messages in this case were successfully sent and
    received by their intended recipient is evidence that the computer programs
    used in the routing process performed “logic and control” functions in the

    in applying the sentencing principles and guidelines identified by this court
    in <i>R. v. D.D.</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471. He also submits that she
    erred in using <i>R. v. Deck</i> (2006), 208 C.C.C. (3d) 341 (Alta. C.A.) as a
    reference point because it “is not instructive in Ontario” particularly when
    there is ample authority in Ontario that is “inconsistent with the approach
    adopted in Alberta.” </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that in applying the
    principles of <i>D.D.</i> to his case, the trial judge failed to recognize that <i>D.D.</i> involved an offender who violated numerous young boys on a regular
    basis over a lengthy period of time, whereas his case involved a single
    isolated incident of sexual abuse. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made no such error in my view.
    She fully appreciated that the appellant’s overt sexual misconduct towards the

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To the extent that the trial judge relied on <i>D.D.</i>,
    she simply extracted from it the principles of sentencing that this court has
    said should apply to adult sexual predators who exploit innocent children.
    These principles include that the sentencing objectives of denunciation,
    general and specific deterrence and the need to separate offenders from society
    must take precedence over the other recognized objectives of sentencing (<i>D.D. </i>at para. 34).  As I shall explain further when I discuss the
    appropriateness of the global sentence in this case, the trial judge was
    correct in concluding that these principles apply with equal force to the case

    alleged misapplication of <i>D.D.</i> is that the trial judge erred in finding
    that a trust relationship existed between him and the complainant for sentencing
    purposes. In this regard, the appellant points out that, unlike the situation
    in <i>D.D</i>., he did not occupy a position of authority towards the
    complainant, nor was she entrusted to his care or dependent on him in any way. </span></p>

    term “trust” to describe the relationship in this case, I do not agree that
    trial judge had in mind the traditional trust relationship as described in <i>D.D</i>.
    The trial judge fully understood that the relationship between the appellant
    and the complainant was not the classic “position of trust” situation. In her
    reasons, after quoting a passage from <i>D.D.</i> in which the court referred
    to the abuse of children by “adult offenders in a position of trust”, the trial
    judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In reviewing that paragraph, I am
    mindful of the fact that this is not a traditional relationship of trust as is
    found in so many cases. At the same time, [the complainant] did come to trust
    Mr.&nbsp;Woodward in light of the frequency of their cyber contact.</span></p>

    judge was referring to the grooming techniques the appellant used to gain the
    complainant’s trust. This is the type of “trust” that Fish J., writing for the
    court, discussed in <i>R. v. Legare </i>(2009), 249 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.),
    at paras. 29 and 30:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>But those who use their computers

  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>…<i>computer communications may

    this court’s decision in <i>R. v. F.(G.C.)</i> (2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 68,
    which treated grooming as an aggravating feature in a sexual assault case.  In
    my view, grooming also properly constitutes an aggravating feature in the
    offence of luring and the trial judge did not err in treating it as such. </span></p>

    submission that the trial judge erred in considering <i>Deck</i>. The facts in
    that case are similar to the facts in the present case, although by no means
    identical. Deck received a total sentence of seven years’ imprisonment for
    luring a 13-year-old child, who was of below average intelligence, to have sex
    with him and then proceeding to have intercourse with her on three separate
    occasions. Unlike the appellant, Deck pleaded guilty to the offence of luring
    and to the offence of sexual interference with a person under the age of 14
    years, contrary to s. 151 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. By pleading guilty, he
    spared the child from having to relive the events and from undergoing
    cross-examination designed to undermine her testimony. </span></p>

    that “the Alberta Court [of Appeal] has taken a different stance with regard to

    Be that as it may, the overriding principles of sentencing endorsed by the
    court in <i>Deck</i> for adult sexual predators who exploit innocent children
    are very much in line with the principles this court enunciated in <i>D.D.</i> The trial judge was entitled to consider those principles and she did not err
    in doing so.    </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a
    consecutive sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment for the offence of luring. The
    appellant acknowledges that it was open to the trial judge to impose a
    consecutive sentence for that charge. Having done so, however, he maintains
    that she was not entitled to use the same conduct, and particularly the
    grooming aspect of it, as an aggravating feature on both the luring and sexual
    assault charges.  According to the appellant, if the trial judge increased the
    sentences on both counts based on the aggravating feature of the grooming
    aspect surrounding the offence of luring, that would amount to impermissible
    “double counting”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In support of this argument, the appellant
    relies on two passages from the trial judge’s reasons, both of which are
    contained in a list of aggravating features identified by the trial judge:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It is aggravating further that
    this offence occurred through the use of luring over the internet. Mr. Woodward
    contacted the complainant from hundreds of kilometers away … He then travelled
    to [name of location omitted to protect complainant’s identity] where he
    committed the offences… He was able to do so through the use of the internet
    without the watchful eyes of [the complainant’s] parents being aware of
    anything that was going on.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I also consider the number of
    communications between Mr.&nbsp;Woodward and the complainant. I have
    highlighted the frequency of contact leading up to the allegations and that
    there was some communication thereafter. I find this very troubling the degree
    to which Mr. Woodward was contacting this complainant. What is aggravating is
    that there is a predatory aspect to the manner in which he initiated and
    maintained intensive contact with the complainant leading up to the offences.
    She developed a virtual relationship with him, such that she ultimately was in
    a relationship with him where she trusted him with her secrets.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I cannot be certain from reading the trial
    judge’s reasons that she did not use the appellant’s efforts at grooming the
    complainant to increase his punishment on both the luring offence and the
    sexual assault offence.  Assuming she did engage in impermissible double counting,
    I consider the error to be harmless in the circumstances. At most, it would
    have warranted a slight reduction in sentence on either the luring count or the
    sexual assault count. Overall, as I shall explain, the global sentence of
    six-and-one-half years was within the appropriate sentencing range and I would
    not disturb it.  </span></p>

    the offences against the complainant. This was by no means his first encounter
    with the criminal justice system. Since the age of 15, he has been in trouble
    with the law on a regular and persistent basis. Before the offences in issue,
    he had amassed a criminal record consisting of over 40 prior convictions. Most
    of his convictions are for crimes of dishonesty and include several dozen
    offences for fraud, theft, and possession of stolen property.  In short, the
    appellant’s entire adult life has been marked by criminal deceit and duplicity. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is against the backdrop of this history of
    criminality that the trial judge treated the appellant’s record for fraudulent
    conduct as an aggravating feature. The impugned passage from her reasons reads
    as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Another aggravating feature is
    that Mr. Woodward has a record for fraudulent conduct. Although there are no
    prior sex offences on his record, which is a mitigating feature in relation to
    his personal situation, I find at the same time that one could view the
    offences before the court as a very cunning fraud of a magnitude not previously
    founded in a conviction that has been registered against him. The
    communications between he and the complainant involved sexual dialogue about
    sexual activity. He was seductive and exploited [the complainant] and he took
    advantage of her being so naïve.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes issue with that passage. He
    claims that it was wrong for the trial judge to compare “the calculated deceit
    required to perpetrate a money fraud with the social acumen required to engage
    someone in sexually explicit conversation”. He further submits that “the use of
    such a tenuous comparison cannot trigger the rationale for imposing harsher
    penalties upon a defendant who has prior convictions for the same or similar
    misconduct.”</span></p>

    to consider the appellant’s previous duplicitous conduct as an aggravating
    feature in his crimes against the complainant. The same type of conduct that
    led to his many previous convictions played a central role in the crimes he
    committed against the 12-year-old complainant. Not only did he mislead her as
    to his name and age, he also led her to believe that he would make her very
    rich if she engaged in sexual conduct with him. To that end, he concocted an
    elaborate story about having received a huge inheritance from a family member
    in Russia before he immigrated to Canada. To prove the extent of his enormous
    wealth and to convince the complainant that he was not misleading her about it,
    he had the complainant listen to a call to the bank wherein he purported to
    transfer millions of dollars into an account earmarked for her. Of course, the
    call was a misleading ruse.  In addition to showing him to be morally bankrupt
    and a man of no scruples, the underlying misconduct for which the appellant was
    sentenced in this case was properly treated by the trial judge as misconduct with
    similar characteristics to that which had led to his prior convictions.  </span></p>

    one-time isolated incident with no overt threats or violence and no abuse of
    trust or authority.”  He points to a number of authorities, including some from
    this court, involving offenders who engaged in online sexually explicit
    conversations with undercover police officers posing as children under the age
    of 14. In some of those cases, the conduct went beyond sexually explicit
    conversations and involved the transmission of sexually explicit images and/or
    sexually explicit acts. See <i>R. v. El-Jamel</i>, 2010 ONCA 575; <i>R. v.

    months to two years. That stems from a comment found at para. 31 of the
    decision, where Rosenberg J.A., for the court, made the observation that the “</span>decisions

    briefly. Jarvis pleaded guilty to luring a child over the internet. He was a
    22-year-old first offender. He had seven communications with an undercover
    officer whom he believed to be a 13-year-old girl. In the course of his
    communications with the officer, he engaged in sexually explicit discussions
    and forwarded two photographs of his penis to the undercover officer. Jarvis
    pressed the undercover officer to meet in person and the officer agreed to do
    so. Jarvis was arrested when he arrived at the designated meeting point. He was

    First, I am not at all persuaded that Rosenberg J.A. was purporting to set the
    range of sentence for the offence of luring at 12 months to two years.
    Rosenberg J.A.’s reasons do not focus on the range of sentence for the offence
    of luring. Rather, they are concerned primarily with a discussion about certain
    evidence that the Crown sought to introduce at trial and additional evidence
    that it proposed to introduce as fresh evidence on appeal primarily for the purpose
    of establishing that children frequently use the internet and are vulnerable to
    being exposed to sexual content and sexual invitations. The evidence in dispute
    involved information obtained from a survey of children, 99% of whom reported
    that they used the internet to some extent.  Many of the children surveyed
    reported that in their internet use they had received pornography on numerous
    occasions, had been exposed to unwanted sexual comments, and had been asked to
    meet in person the individual with whom they were chatting. None of the
    impugned evidence was admitted on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even if <i>Jarvis</i> did purport to set a range
    of 12 to 24 months for the offence of luring, that range needs to be revised
    given the 2007 amendment in which Parliament doubled the maximum punishment
    from 5 years to 10 years. Moreover, if it is shown through the introduction of
    properly-tendered evidence that the offence of luring has become a pervasive social
    problem, I believe that much stiffer sentences, in the range of three to five
    years, might well be warranted to deter, denounce and separate from society
    adult predators who would commit this insidious crime.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One need only consider the facts of this case to
    appreciate the dangers and disturbing features of the crime of luring and the grave
    consequences that may flow from it –   here, a face-to-face meeting between a
    30-year-old predator and a 12-year-old child, resulting in the sexual assault
    of the child. Fortunately, the appellant did not inflict further harm on the complainant
    after the sexual assault. That, perhaps, is the one positive thing that can be
    said about him. But the offence of luring carries very real dangers – innocent
    children being seduced and sexually assaulted or even worse, kidnapped,

    on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Robinson, </i>2002 CanLII 44969, 159 OAC
    286 (Ont. C.A.).  Robinson was convicted of sexual assault and a related charge

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The appellant and the complainant met on a chat

    complainant was a 13 year old grade 8 student.  On the chat line, the appellant
    pretended to be a seventeen year old high school football player.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The complainant testified that she eventually met
    the appellant in person in the fall of 1997 and saw him on several occasions
    between November 1997 and the end of March 1998. According to her, they had
    sexual intercourse at various places on several occasions over that time
    period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his testimony at trial, Robinson denied engaging in any kind of
    sexual activity with the complainant. By its verdict, the jury obviously
    rejected his evidence. This court found no merit in Robinson’s appeal from
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In appealing his one-year sentence, Robinson argued that the trial judge
    was wrong in concluding that a conditional sentence was not warranted in the
    circumstances. This court rejected the appellant’s argument. In doing so, the
    court held at para. 19 that even if the trial judge erred as alleged, a
    conditional sentence was not appropriate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This offence involved repeated sexual intercourse
    with a thirteen year old child by a school teacher.  While there was no
    position of trust as between the complainant and the appellant, the appellant
    more than most people must understand the harm done to children by the kind of
    sexual conduct in which he engaged.  There is also a predatory aspect to the
    manner in which the appellant initiated and maintained intensive contact with
    the complainant.  A non-custodial sentence would have been inappropriate in the
    circumstances of this case.  <i>Considering the nature of the offence and the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also relies on Blouin J.’s decision in <i>R. v.
    Lithgow</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4448 (C.J.).  Lithgow pleaded guilty to sexual
    exploitation under s.&nbsp;153(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and luring under
    s. 172.1(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The facts in <i>Lithgow</i> are set
    out at paras. 2 to 4 of the decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The complainant was 14 and 15 during
    the grades 9 and 10 years that Mr. Lithgow, then in his early fifties, was her
    teacher.&nbsp; During those two years they e-mailed and chatted using a
    computer.&nbsp; The discussion became increasingly more sexual in nature and
    developed into visits at lunch where touching occurred.&nbsp; Mr. Lithgow told
    the complainant that he loved her.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>When the complainant was in Grade 11,
    Mr. Lithgow was no longer her teacher but continued in a position of trust
    acting as her math tutor.&nbsp; They continued contact by electronic means,
    which ultimately lead to oral sex and then unprotected intercourse on 25 to 30
    occasions.&nbsp; He supplied alcohol and made her promise not to tell
    anyone.&nbsp; Except for the law, which prohibits consent under 18 in these
    situations, there was no indication of any lack of consent.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Eventually the complainant told her
    mother and the police were called.&nbsp; Mr. Lithgow, to his credit, gave an
    inculpatory statement to the police and made no attempt to get bail.&nbsp; When
    his wife found out, she ordered him out of the house.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The reasons for sentence disclose that Lithgow had
    a record for uttering threats and breach of probation which post-dated the
    commission of the offences for which he was being sentenced. According to the
    pre-sentence report filed with the court, Lithgow had a history of anxiety,
    depression and suicidal ideation culminating in a diagnosis of major mood
    disorder. He was in need of mental health intervention and was motivated to
    receive mental health assistance while in custody and upon release. In the
    opinion of his probation officer, Lithgow did not “pose an imminent risk to the
    greater community”. At the time of sentencing, Lithgow had been in pre-trial
    custody for approximately five months.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In the circumstances, the Crown sought a sentence
    of two years less a day minus the time Lithgow had spent in pre-trial custody.
    The defence essentially requested that he be given a conditional sentence,
    taking into account the time he had already served in pre-trial custody.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Blouin J. provided thorough reasons for sentence.
    At paras. 16 and 17, he set out the aggravating and mitigating factors of the
    case as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span lang=EN style='font-size:7.0pt'> </span></b><span
lang=EN>In concluding, the aggravating factors involve the breach of trust
    inherent in both of these offences.&nbsp; The difference in age between the
    complainant and the accused in this case was as great as one could
    imagine.&nbsp; Only time will tell the damage done to the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>In mitigation, Mr. Lithgow pleaded
    guilty at the earliest opportunity, did not apply for bail, admitted his
    offence to the police, and has publicly showed great remorse for his offending
    behaviour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In the end, Blouin J. concluded that a sentence of
    15 months for the offence of sexual exploitation, less 10 months’ credit for
    time spent in pre-trial custody, was appropriate. On the charge of luring, he
    imposed a 12-month conditional sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I find <i>Lithgow </i>to be of limited assistance. 
    First of all, there were many mitigating factors in that case that do not exist
    in the appellant’s case. Unlike in <i>Lithgow, </i>the appellant did not plead
    guilty. Moreover, based on the record, he has no sense of the gravity and
    seriousness of his crimes, there is no evidence that he suffers from any form
    of mental illness, he is utterly without remorse, and he is not motivated in
    the slightest to change his ways. In addition, he has a very lengthy criminal
    record consisting of more than 40 prior convictions dating back to 1991. He has
    been in and out of jail since that time. His work record is sporadic at best
    and he has done virtually nothing of a productive nature for his entire life –
    a life characterized by fraud and dishonesty. Those factors alone serve to
    distinguish this case from <i>Lithgow.</i> They also distinguish it from <i>Robinson</i>,
    where the court at para. 19 referred to, but did not identify, the “mitigating
    factors relating to the appellant”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In any event, even if there are similarities
    between this case and <i>Lithgow</i> and <i>Robinson</i>, in my view, the
    sentences imposed in those cases do not establish an appropriate range for the
    type of offences committed by the appellant based on the sentencing principles
    established by this court in <i>D.D.</i> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The case of <i>D.D</i>., it will be recalled,
    involved an adult predator in a position of trust who sexually abused a number
    of young boys on a regular basis over a lengthy period of time. The court in
    that case considered the appropriate range of sentences for offenders who
    engage in such conduct.  In doing so, the court discussed the plight of
    children in general and the principles and objects of sentencing that must take
    precedence when adult predators choose to exploit innocent young children. The
    relevant considerations and principles from <i>D.D.</i>, at paras. 34-38, are
    summarized below:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Our children are our most valued and our most vulnerable
    assets.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>We as a society owe it to our children to protect
    them from the harm caused by sexual predators.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Throughout their formative years, children are very
    susceptible to being taken advantage of by adult sexual offenders and they make
    easy prey for such predators.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Adult sexual predators recognize that children are
    particularly vulnerable and they exploit this weakness to achieve their selfish
    ends, heedless of the dire consequences that can and often do follow. </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN>(5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Three such consequences are now well-recognized:
    (i) children often suffer immediate physical and psychological harm; (ii)
    children who have been sexually abused may never be able, as an adult, to form
    a loving, caring relationship with another adult; (iii) and children who have
    been sexually abused are prone to become abusers themselves when they reach
    adulthood. </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN>(6)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Absent exceptional circumstances, in the case of
    adult predators, the objectives of sentencing commonly referred to as
    denunciation, general and specific deterrence and the need to separate
    offenders from society must take precedence over the other recognized
    objectives of sentencing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The foregoing concerns inform the fundamental
    message that <i>D.D.</i> sought to convey at para. 45:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The harm occasioned [to children] by
    [adult sexual predators] is cause for grave concern. Children are robbed of
    their youth and innocence, families are often torn apart or rendered
    dysfunctional, lives are irretrievably damaged and sometimes permanently
    destroyed. Because of this, the message to such offenders must be clear – prey
    upon innocent children and you will pay a heavy price!</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>With respect, I do not believe that the price paid in <i>Robinson</i> or <i>Lithgow</i> was a heavy one. Indeed, I believe that the
    sentences in those cases were manifestly inadequate.  <i>Robinson</i> predated <i>D.D</i>.
    and is not determinative for that reason; <i>Lithgow</i> did not refer to the
    principles in <i>D.D</i>.  Had the principles in <i>D.D.</i> been applied, I
    believe that the appellants in those cases would have received substantially
    higher sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Adult predators who seduce and violate young
    children must face the prospect of a significant penitentiary term. The
    five-year sentence imposed on the appellant for the sexual assault he committed
    on the 12-year-old complainant is not excessive. In the light of the
    appellant’s past criminal activity and the lack of any meaningful mitigating
    factors available to him, if anything, it was lenient. While acknowledging that
    trial judges retain the flexibility to fashion a fit and just sentence in the
    particular case, crimes like those committed by the appellant will typically
    warrant mid- to upper-level single digit penitentiary sentences. The additional
    18 months the appellant received for the offence of luring was entirely
    appropriate and did not render the global sentence excessive. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In so concluding, I wish to emphasize that when
    trial judges are sentencing adult sexual predators who have exploited innocent
    children, the focus of the sentencing hearing should be on the harm caused to
    the child by the offender’s conduct and the life-altering consequences that can
    and often do flow from it. While the effects of a conviction on the offender
    and the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation will always warrant
    consideration, the objectives of denunciation, deterrence, and the need to
    separate sexual predators from society for society’s well-being and the well-being
    of our children must take precedence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The victim impact statement filed by the
    complainant speaks to the immediate harm she suffered. Her grades in school
    have slipped, she feels unwell at times, she experiences nightmares and crying
    bouts, she does not respect white males that are older than her and generally,
    she “let everything go ... and just didn’t care anymore, about anything at
    all”, thinking at times “that it was my fault”.  Hopefully, in time, she will
    be able to overcome these problems and move forward with her life. </span></p>
