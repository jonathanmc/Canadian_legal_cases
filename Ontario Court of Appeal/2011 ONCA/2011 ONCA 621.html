    Crown recognized the decision was of limited relevance because appeals of Part
    I offences are provided for under different sections of the POA than Part III
    offences. The decision in <i>Melaku</i> turned on the particular words of those
    different sections.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=X-NONE>However, the Crown relies on <i>Melaku</i> for </span><span
lang=EN-US>Epstein J.A.’s assertion that a limited right of appeal is </span><span
lang=X-NONE>consistent with the overall scheme of the POA, the object of the
    POA and the intention of the legislature. Epstein J.A. said, at para. 44, that
    the dead-end for appeals is consistent with the “various provisions in the POA
    [that] clearly contemplate a summary procedure, one that is efficient and
    expedient, when it comes to the progress of certain types of offences,
    particularly ones, such as those involved in this case, that are more
    regulatory than criminal in nature.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=X-NONE>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=X-NONE>Counsel for the applicant points out that in <i>R.
    v. Klimov</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 215 (C.A.) (QL), this court granted leave to
    appeal from a decision refusing an extension of time. However, that brief endorsement
    did not consider the jurisdictional issue. Counsel went on to point out that <a
name="P1935_184305"></a><a name=s135s1></a><a name=BK175></a><a
name="P1965_188086"></a><a name=s139s1></a><a name=BK179></a>s. 131 provides an
    appeal “from the judgment of the court” to the Court of Appeal. He submitted that
    the word “judgment” was broad enough to encompass a decision denying an
    extension of time to appeal. He relied on the decision <a name="P1922_182548"></a><a
name=s131s1></a><a name=BK170></a>of <i>R. v. Belanger</i>, [2006] O.J. No.
    3453 (C.A.) (QL), in which Gillese J.A. (in chambers) took that view. She stated
    that there is no reason to restrict the meaning of the word “judgment” in s.
    131 to exclude decisions refusing to extend time. She regarded such an approach
    as consistent with the decision of Blair J.A. (in chambers) in <i>R. v Valente</i> (1982), 40 O.R. (2d) 535 (C.A.). In that case, Blair J.A. considered a decision
    declining jurisdiction to be a judgment disposing of the appeal. At the same
    time, Gillese J.A. noted that in <i>R. v. Gonsalves</i>, [1995] O.J. No. 4046
    (C.A.) (QL), a panel of this court expressed doubt that it could hear an appeal
    from an order refusing an extension of time to appeal (albeit in a summary
    conviction matter). Consequently, while Gillese J.A. granted leave, she
    deferred the jurisdictional question to the panel hearing the appeal. The <i>Belanger</i> case never proceeded to appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=X-NONE>In my view, whether leave to appeal a denial of
    an extension of time can be sought under s. 131 of the POA does not turn on the
    meaning of the word “judgment” in the provision. Section 131 must interpreted in
    its grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the whole </span>POA<span
lang=X-NONE>, the object of the </span>POA<span lang=X-NONE>, and the intention
    of the legislature. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=X-NONE>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>As noted above, s. 131 is found in Part VII of
    the POA, which creates a two tier route for appeals to this court. Section 131,
    dealing with appeals to this court for Part III offences, must be read in conjunction
    with s. 116, which provides for the initial appeal. If s. 131 is construed literally
    in isolation, it would allow appeals from all “judgments of the court”, even
    those at first instance, thereby nullifying the two tier route of appeals that
    is clearly intended for Part III offences. That construction would render s.
    116 superfluous and provide two different routes to appeal POA judgments at
    first instance to the Court of Appeal. For example, the original decision of
    the justice of the peace in this case would be a “judgment of the court” and so
    would be appealable directly to this court. Such a result is inconsistent with
    the structure of the POA and the route of appeals it clearly provides for.
    Section 131 must be construed in conjunction with s. 116. The words “the
    judgment of the court” in s. 131 must mean the judgment of the court to which
    the initial appeal is taken under s. 116.</span></p>

    place appointed for a hearing and it is proved by the prosecutor, having been
    given a reasonable opportunity to do so, that a summons was served, a notice of
    trial was given under Part I or II, an undertaking to appear was given or a
    recognizance to appear was entered into, as the case may be, or where the
    defendant does not appear upon the resumption of a hearing that has been
    adjourned, the court may,</p>
  <p class=IndentQuote>(a) proceed to hear and determine the proceeding in
    the absence of the defendant; or</p>
  <p class=IndentQuote>(b) adjourn the hearing and, if

    to prove </span>that <span lang=X-NONE>the defendant had notice of the original
    trial date. It does not require the prosecutor to prove that the defendant
    received any notice of an adjourned date. </span></p>

    defendant receive notice of further appearances and trial dates directly from

    th</span>at<span lang=X-NONE> right by appearing at the time and place fixed
    for the trial. Section 54 merely provides the machinery to be employed if the
