style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The</a> appellant challenges his convictions of sexual assault, sexual
    interference and breach of probation on several grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge convicted him on the basis
    of a transaction that was different than the transaction that had formed the
    basis of the prosecution. We do not agree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made an express finding that the appellant intentionally
    touched the complainant’s vagina in the bathtub. We are not persuaded that the
    reference to the so called “airplane incident” tainted the findings in relation
    to those incidents that occurred in the bathtub or caused the appellant any
    miscarriage of justice. Neither are we persuaded that the trial judge’s reasons
    are insufficient despite their brevity and organizational confusion. Read in
    the context of the evidentiary record in this case, we are satisfied that the
    reasons are adequate to the task demanded of them by the authorities and reflect
    the core findings necessary for the convictions recorded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction of breach of probation is another matter. The trial judge
    did not make a discrete finding concerning the date upon which the sexual
    interference and assault occurred. It follows, in our view, that in the
    peculiar circumstances of this case, the conviction of breach of probation was
    unreasonable and cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent agrees that we should enter a stay on the conviction of
    sexual assault if we affirm the conviction of sexual interference. We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal from conviction of sexual interference is
    dismissed. The appeal from conviction of sexual assault is allowed and a stay
    entered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from the conviction of breach of probation on the information
    charging the sexual offences is allowed and an acquittal entered. We are
    satisfied that the sentence imposed on the count of breach of probation with
    which we are concerned was concurrent to the sentence imposed for the sexual
    offences. The appellant pleaded guilty to several other breach offences
    contained in a separate information. Those convictions are not before us
    however, nor are the sentences imposed as a result of those convictions.  </p>
