  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The overarching issue in this appeal is whether the
    application judge erred in granting a declaration that the appellant, RBC
    General Insurance Company (“RBC”), has a duty to defend and indemnify the
    respondents, Nagraj Singh Tut (“Nagraj”) and Gurmeet Kaur Tut (“Gurmeet”), in
    two actions arising out of a motor vehicle accident.  A brief contextual
    description is warranted to appreciate the arguments. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On the morning of June 23, 2007, Nagraj asked his
    mother, Gurmeet, if he could use her car to drive some friends home.  The
    friends had spent the previous night at the Tut family’s house celebrating Nagraj’s
    20th birthday with him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The accident occurred while Nagraj was driving on
    the highway that morning.  At approximately 8:51 a.m., the car went off the road
    as Nagraj was attempting to pass another car using the gravel shoulder. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Although no charges were laid as a result of the
    accident, the St. Michael’s Hospital Laboratory Results Report indicated that Nagraj
    had a blood alcohol concentration of 26.8 mmol/L at approximately 10:45 a.m. on
    the date of the accident.  Nagraj, the holder of a G2 driver’s licence, was not
    permitted to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration greater
    than zero: see </span><i>Drivers’ Licences</i>,<b> </b><span lang=EN>O. Reg.
    340/94, s. 6(1), enacted pursuant to the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. H.8 (“<i>HTA</i>”).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The passengers in Gurmeet’s car subsequently sued
    Nagraj and Gurmeet in two actions for damages for the injuries they sustained
    in the accident.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Both Nagraj and Gurmeet were covered by an RBC
    automobile insurance policy.  However, their coverage was subject to a statutory
    condition that states, “The insured shall not drive or operate or permit any
    other person to drive or operate the automobile unless the insured or other
    person is authorized by law to drive or operate it”: see<i> Statutory
    Conditions - Automobile Insurance</i>, O. Reg. 777/93, s. 4(1), enacted
    pursuant to the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>RBC denied coverage to Nagraj because, at the time
    of the accident, he was not “authorized by law to drive” as his blood alcohol
    content was greater than zero.  RBC denied coverage to Gurmeet because she
    permitted Nagraj to drive on the morning of the accident when she knew or ought
    to have known that he was not authorized by law to do so.  Thus, RBC was not
    obliged to provide counsel to defend them in the damages actions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The respondents successfully brought an application
    for insurance coverage.  The application judge agreed that RBC could not deny
    coverage to the respondents on the basis of statutory condition 4(1).  As all
    the subsidiary grounds of appeal arise from the application judge’s reasons, I
    will summarize them before turning to the issues and my analysis of them.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPLICATION JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The essence of the application judge’s reasons is
    as follows.  Statutory condition 4(1) precludes insurance coverage for Nagraj if
    he was not authorized by law to drive.  Nagraj would not be authorized by law
    to drive if he contravened s. 6(1) when he drove with a blood alcohol
    concentration greater than zero.  Section 6(1) creates a strict liability
    offence, so will not be contravened if Nagraj took all reasonable care in the
    circumstances.  Accordingly, if reasonable care is established, statutory
    condition 4(1) will not apply to preclude insurance coverage for Nagraj.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Although the respondents admitted that Nagraj <i>prima
    facie </i>contravened s. 6(1) by driving with a blood alcohol content greater
    than zero, the application judge found that Nagraj had a reasonable and honest
    belief that his blood alcohol content was zero when he awoke the morning after
    his party. On the basis of the evidence of those at the party, Nagraj had six
    to nine hours of sleep that night.&nbsp; His belief that he was qualified to
    drive was a reasonable mistake of fact.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>RBC relied on the report of the toxicology expert,
    Dr. Kalant, to support the conclusion that, based on Nagraj’s height and
    weight, it would not have been reasonable for Nagraj to believe that his blood
    alcohol level did not exceed zero per cent that morning.  However, the
    application judge discounted the report on the basis that Dr. Kalant used the
    wrong height and weight for Nagraj in his calculations and based his
    calculations on Nagraj having had “several” hours of sleep instead of the six
    to nine hours he did have.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In the case of Gurmeet, statutory condition 4(1)
    precludes insurance coverage if Gurmeet permitted Nagraj to drive when he was
    not authorized by law to do so.  The application judge held that Gurmeet was
    not in breach of the statutory condition.  RBC did not establish that Gurmeet
    knew or ought to have known, under the circumstances, that she was permitting
    Nagraj to drive when he was not authorized by law to do so. Gurmeet questioned
    Nagraj about the party and confirmed that he had slept that night. She had
    previously instructed him not to drive after drinking and there is no evidence
    that he ever failed to comply with that rule. She saw nothing either in the
    house or in her son’s manner that would make it necessary for her to question
    him regarding the amount of alcohol he had consumed the night before.&nbsp; The
    application judge held that Gurmeet acted reasonably in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Overall, the application judge held that the
    respondents were not excluded from coverage under the RBC automobile insurance
    policy.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=Paragraphnumber><span lang=EN>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>RBC’s appeal seeks to have the application judge’s decision
    set aside and the application for coverage dismissed with costs or,
    alternatively, requests a new hearing.  RBC alleges that the application judge made
    the following errors:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>(a)</span><span lang=EN>       She applied a test of strict liability
    rather than absolute liability to determine whether Nagraj breached s. 6(1). </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span
lang=EN>       In the event s.</span> 6(1) is a strict liability offence, she
    placed the onus of proof on RBC rather than Nagraj after RBC established a <i>prima
    facie</i> case.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)
          She placed the onus of proof on RBC rather than Gurmeet after RBC
    established a <i>prima facie</i> case.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)
          She misapprehended and, consequently, discounted the expert opinion of
    Dr. Kalant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)
          She misapprehended the evidence of Gurmeet.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US>         Did the application judge err in applying a test of strict
    liability rather than absolute liability to determine whether Nagraj breached
    s. 6(1)?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>RBC acknowledges that there is a presumption that
    public welfare offences are strict liability offences. That is, once a
    contravention of the legislation has been proven, a defence of due diligence,
    that the person took all reasonable steps to avoid the contravention, is
    available. While it is essential for society to maintain high standards of
    public safety through effective enforcement, there is general revulsion against
    punishing the morally innocent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As set out in <i>R. v. Kanda </i>(2008),<i> </i></span>88
    O.R. (3d) 732 (C.A.)<span lang=EN>, at para. 19, four factors must be
    considered in determining whether an offence is one of absolute liability, for
    which only the contravening act need be proven, or of strict liability: (1) the
    overall regulatory pattern; (2) the penalty; (3) the precision of the language
    used; and (4) the subject-matter. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>  RBC argues that s. 6(1) is an absolute liability
    offence based on the four <i>Kanda </i>factors:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         The
    overall regulatory scheme is to limit and prevent impaired driving.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         The
    penalty is not imprisonment, which would exclude the possibility of the offence
    being an absolute liability offence, but a suspension of the driver’s licence. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Section
    6(1) uses the word “must” in the first of its conditions: “The novice driver’s
    blood alcohol concentration <i>must </i>be zero at all times” (emphasis added).
     The language in s. 6(1) is similar to the “no person shall” or “every driver
    shall” phraseology used in some absolute liability offences.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.         The
    subject matter – preventing inexperienced drivers from drinking and driving – and
    legislative intent of zero tolerance are consistent with absolute liability
    offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In <i>Kanda</i>,<i> </i>MacPherson J.A. held that the
    offence of failing to ensure that a passenger under 16 years old properly wears
    a seat belt under s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA </i>was a strict liability, and not
    an absolute liability, offence.  In that case, a child passenger was involved
    in creating the violation by undoing his seat belt.  In concluding that the
    offence was one of strict liability, a factor the court considered was that the
    violation may not result directly from the driver’s own conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>RBC submits that a violation of the s. 6(1)
    requirement for a blood alcohol content of zero can only arise from the
    driver’s own conduct and that, consequently, s. 6(1) ought to be an absolute
    liability offence.  That is simply not the case.  For example, in <i>R. v.
    Maharaj </i>(2010), 98 M.V.R. (5th) 316 (Ont. C.J.), the accused probationary
    driver consumed a soft drink that, unknown to him, had been adulterated with
    vodka.  Thus, conduct other than that of the driver can contribute to a
    violation of the zero blood alcohol content requirement. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>RBC relies on two recent cases which held that s.
    6(1) is an absolute liability offence.  Neither case assists RBC.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The first case, <i>Maharaj</i>,<i> </i>refers to
    this court’s decision in <i>Kanda</i>, but does not correctly apply it.  The
    court in <i>Maharaj</i> takes into consideration the public safety goal of the
    legislation without engaging in any real weighing of society’s revulsion
    against punishing the morally innocent.  The latter is why the law recognizes a
    presumption against absolute liability.  Instead, <i>Maharaj </i>places
    emphasis on the fact that driving is a privilege, and on ease and efficiency of
    enforcement.  In my opinion, it is wrongly decided. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The second case RBC relies on, <i>R. v. Nyaata</i>,<i> </i>2005 ONCJ 454, states that the offence of having a blood alcohol content
    greater than zero is an absolute liability offence.  However, the court also held
    that the evidence of a strong odour of alcohol on the accused’s breath and the
    fact he held a G2 licence constituted a <i>prima facie </i>case that was
    rebuttable but, as the defence had called no evidence, a conviction would be
    registered.  Holding that the violation of s. 6(1) can be rebutted is
    inconsistent with the offence being one of absolute liability.  This case, too,
    is of no assistance to RBC.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Applying the factors in <i>Kanda </i>to this case,
    I make the following observations:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Kanda,</i> this court was concerned with the same overall
    legislative scheme as here, namely, the <i>HTA, </i>and it held that the

    driver’s licence.  This penalty is more severe than the penalty of a modest
    fine for the seat belt infraction in <i>Kanda</i>.  This factor tilts more in
    favour of the offence in this case being one of strict liability as compared to <i>Kanda</i>. </p>

    by specifically excluding a due diligence defence.  The language of s. 6(1) does
    not specifically preclude a due diligence defence.  Section 6(1) also uses the
    mandatory word “must” but, as noted at para. 38 of <i>Kanda</i>, the case law
    does not support the conclusion that mandatory language necessarily results in
    absolute liability.</p>

    and protection of users of the road.  The court in <i>Kanda </i>held that
    classification of the offence as one of strict liability was an appropriate
    balance between encouraging drivers to be vigilant about safety and not
    punishing those who exercise due diligence.  I would reach the same conclusion

    belief that his blood alcohol content was zero.  RBC submits that Nagraj failed
    to satisfy this onus given that he had no recollection of the morning of the
    accident, he stated to the adjuster that he intended to consume more alcohol on
    the night of his birthday than he normally would and, when tested approximately
    two hours after the accident, he had a blood alcohol content of 1.5 times the

    St. Michael’s Hospital laboratory results, Nagraj probably had at least 10
    standard drinks over the course of his birthday party and that, notwithstanding
    “several hours of sleep”, he would still have exhibited signs of alcohol in his

    and 160 pounds, whereas in his cross-examination Nagraj testified he was 5’11”
    and about 200 pounds, a little heavier than at the time of the accident. 
    Besides the discrepancy in height and weight, the application judge found the
    amount of sleep Nagraj had was between six and nine hours, and observed that
    this was less than the amount normally understood by a reference to “several
    hours”.  RBC takes issue with this latter finding and submits that the
    application judge ought to have preferred other evidence that would lead to the
    conclusion that the range was between five to eight hours.  Overall, RBC submits
    that there was no basis for the application judge to take judicial notice that
    these differences would have substantially impacted the opinion of Dr. Kalant.  </span></p>

    importantly, Dr. Kalant’s report was inconclusive.  It failed to establish that
    it would have been apparent to a reasonable person that Nagraj had so much to
    drink the night before that he could not drive in the morning.  The question of
    whether Nagraj’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol is one of fact and
    non-expert witnesses may give evidence as to the degree of a person’s
    impairment: <i>R. v. Graat</i>,<i> </i>[1982] 2 S.C.R. 819.  The application

    facie </i>case against Gurmeet.  A <i>prima facie </i>breach by Nagraj, as the
    driver, was not an automatic<i> prima facie</i> breach by Gurmeet, as the owner
    of the car.  As counsel for RBC agreed in oral argument, whether the driver is
    in breach of statutory condition 4(1) is a separate question from whether the
    owner of the car is in breach.  See, for example, <i>Campos v. Aviva Canada
    Inc.</i> (2006), 38 C.C.L.I. (4th) 218 (Ont. S.C.), at paras. 14-15. As indicated,
    statutory condition 4(1) requires that the insured “not drive or operate or
    permit any other person to drive or operate the automobile unless the insured
    or other person is authorized by law to drive or operate it.”  Nagraj was <i>prima
    facie </i>in breach by driving with a blood alcohol content greater than zero. 
    For Gurmeet to be <i>prima facie </i>in breach, RBC must prove that Gurmeet permitted
    Nagraj to drive with a blood alcohol content greater than zero.  </span></p>

    knowledge, willful blindness, or at least a failure to take reasonable steps to
    inform one’s self of the relevant facts”: <i>Miller v. Carluccio </i>(2008), 91

    evidence.  Gurmeet’s evidence on cross-examination was that she and her husband
    did not see anyone drinking, or any alcoholic beverages at all, before they
    left the house around 9:30 or 10 p.m. on the night of the party.  She and her
    husband returned to the house the morning after Nagraj’s birthday party and she
    started to clean up the kitchen.  At that point, she saw no alcohol bottles or
    shot glasses.  She spoke with Nagraj at some point in the morning from a
    distance of between six to eight feet.  (Dr. Kalant’s evidence was that she
    would have had to have been within three feet to smell alcohol on Nagraj.)  Her
    evidence was that her son did not smell of alcohol and did not look tired; his
    hands were not shaking, his voice was not hoarse, and his speech was not
    impaired.  Although Nagraj said that he intended to drink more than usual on
    the night of the party, there is no evidence that he conveyed this intention to
    his mother.  None of the other witnesses observed any signs of alcohol in
    Nagraj on the morning after his party.  The application judge did not
    misapprehend Gurmeet’s evidence.  Her finding that Gurmeet acted reasonably in
    the circumstances is entitled to deference.  </span></p>

    further inquiries of her son and the fact she did not do so means she failed to
    take all reasonable steps to see that the statutory condition was not
    contravened.  In the factual circumstances of this case, Gurmeet had no reason
    to make further inquiry than she did.  The application judge found, in para. 21
    of her reasons, that before Nagraj asked whether he could use Gurmeet’s car to
    drop off his friends, Gurmeet asked him about his party and confirmed that he
    had slept the night before.  There was no evidence that Nagraj had ever
    disobeyed her previous instructions about not drinking and driving. In the
    circumstances, that Gurmeet did not make further inquiry was not a failure to
    take all reasonable steps on her part.  Nothing in Nagraj’s manner and nothing
    Gurmeet saw gave her reason to expect that the car would be driven in
