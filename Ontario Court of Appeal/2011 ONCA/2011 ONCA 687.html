  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal concerns the interpretation of an agreement of purchase
    and sale whereby the respondent agreed to purchase a condominium unit from the appellant.
     The dispute involves whether the respondent is entitled to terminate the
    contract on the basis that the appellant failed to provide occupancy and close
    the transaction on the specific closing date set out in the agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 27, 2004, the appellant, Talon International
    Development Inc. (the “Vendor”), and the respondent, Richard E. Schneeberg (the
    “Purchaser”), entered into an agreement for the purchase of a condominium unit (the
    “Agreement”).  The condominium – then yet to be constructed – is located in the
    Trump International Towers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Purchaser paid
    deposits totalling $212,700 to the Vendor’s solicitors, in trust, to the credit
    of the purchase price of $709,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Agreement specified that the Purchaser would assume occupancy
    and the sale would close on the closing date of March 20, 2009, or such
    extended or accelerated date pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The transaction
    did not close on March 20, 2009, as the unit was not ready for occupancy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 20, 2009, the Purchaser commenced an application for (1)
    a declaration that the Vendor had breached the Agreement by its failure to
    provide occupancy by the specified date, and (2) the return of all paid deposits,
    together with accrued statutory interest pursuant to the <i>Condominium Act,
    1998</i>,<i> </i>S.O. 1998, c. 19. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge granted the relief requested. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Vendor appeals on the grounds that the application judge
    erred in holding that the Agreement, construed as a whole and in its commercial
    context, did not provide the Vendor with the right to extend the March 20, 2009
    occupancy and closing date.  The Vendor’s primary submission on this appeal is that
    the Agreement, properly interpreted, provides that closing shall take place
    March 20, 2009, subject to extensions necessary to bring the unit to the point
    where it is substantially completed and ready for occupancy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Vendor also argues that the application judge erred by treating
    the closing date as a fundamental term of the Agreement, the breach of which
    allowed the Purchaser to terminate the transaction, and by failing to consider whether
    conduct on the Purchaser’s part constituted waiver in respect of the March 20,
    2009 closing date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss the appeal. I agree with the application judge
    that the Agreement does not provide the Vendor with what would amount to an
    unlimited unilateral right to delay closing. I further agree with the
    application judge’s conclusions that the Vendor’s failure to meet the closing
    date entitled the Purchaser to the relief sought, and that the facts do not
    substantiate a finding that the Purchaser had waived his right to terminate the
    Agreement.    </p>

    of labour and materials. The Unit shall be deemed to be substantially completed

    transaction notwithstanding any claim submitted to the Vendor and/or to the
    Warranty Program in respect of apparent deficiencies or incomplete work

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge’s analysis of the key issue – whether the
    Vendor has a right to extend closing in these circumstances – begins with the
    observation that the Agreement, in a number of places, contemplates extensions
    to the closing date, “as may be permitted by the Agreement.”  But the Agreement
    contains no terms pertaining to the “granting of or process involved in
    extending the closing date.”   The application judge describes this as “common
    ground”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After noting that the Agreement must be construed according to
    its terms, the application judge, in keeping with the shared position of
    counsel, herself observes that the Agreement contains no term that specifically
    permits the occupancy closing date to be extended in the event of construction
    delays: “[t]he Agreement simply allows extensions ‘pursuant to these terms’ and
    there are none.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In paras. 22 and 23, the application judge makes further
    observations about the terms of the parties’ agreement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Not only does the Agreement in the within case not
    give the [Vendor] a unilateral right to extend the occupancy date, but
    paragraph 20 gives the [P]urchaser a right to terminate the Agreement if the [V]endor
    is unable to complete the unit for occupancy by the original closing date of
    March 20, 2009. The right is not absolute since the provision also contains the
    words “as may be extended from time to time pursuant to the Agreement.” As
    above noted, however, these words are somewhat inane as nothing in the
    Agreement permits or describes an extension procedure. There are no means of
    extending the closing date in the event of unforeseeable delay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Upon reviewing the provisions of the particular
    contract before me in their entirety, I find that while the parties
    contemplated some extensions, they also specifically gave the [P]urchaser a
    right to terminate the Agreement, absent written consent of the parties to
    extend the closing. The [Vendor] could not unilaterally extend after March 20,
    2009. This conclusion gains some support from the fact that the [Vendor] attempted
    to have the [Purchaser] agree to amend the Agreement to make time of the
    essence and to permit it to extend the closing date.</p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After explaining her clear path to the conclusion that, according
    to the Agreement, the Vendor was not permitted to extend the closing date
    unilaterally, the application judge goes on to hold that even if it were
    determined that the Agreement was ambiguous in this respect, the Agreement must
    be construed against the interests of the Vendor on the basis of the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule.</p>

    the Agreement and claim relief under s. 20 – turns on whether the Agreement permitted
    the Vendor to unilaterally extend the closing date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the application judge noted, the parties contemplated extensions
    to the closing of the transaction. It is clear they therefore intended that the
    Agreement would provide the Vendor with the right to extend the closing date. 
    However, there were to be terms governing the exercise of that right.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These observations bring into focus the divide between the
    parties: whether the Agreement, in fact, contains a provision setting out the
    circumstances under which the Vendor was entitled to extend closing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Purchaser submits that the application judge correctly
    proceeded on the basis that the Agreement contained no conditions governing the
    Vendor’s right to extend closing.  This deficiency, says the Purchaser, means
    that the Vendor’s failure to close the transaction by March 20, 2009 triggered
    his right under para. 20 to terminate the Agreement and have his deposits
    returned.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before this court, counsel for the Vendor takes a different tack
    than that taken before the application judge.  Now, rather than concede that
    the Agreement contains no terms governing the circumstances under which the
    Vendor can delay closing, the Vendor’s argument is that the application judge
    erred in not appreciating that the terms governing its right to extend the
    closing date are found in para. 2(a); the wording of which specifically links
    the Vendor’s right to delay closing to the readiness of the unit for occupancy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In support of its position the Vendor now takes before this
    court, it makes two main arguments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the Vendor submits that on a plain reading of para. 2(a),
    the parties agreed that closing would take place on March 20, 2009, or on
    another date, conditional on the unit’s being substantially completed for
    occupancy as defined in para. 23.  Put more simply, the submission is that the
    parties agreed to set March 20, 2009 as the target date for closing.  However,
    if the transaction could not close on that date (because it was not fit for
    occupancy), the Vendor would have an ongoing right to extend the closing date
    pending the unit’s being suitable for the Purchaser to occupy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the Vendor asserts that by interpreting the Agreement in
    a way that did not allow for closing date extensions, the application judge
    failed to take into account the delays inherent in the business of buying and
    selling newly-built condominium units.  She thereby erred in failing to apply
    one of the basic principles of contractual interpretation: that when parties
    have reduced their accord to writing, in order to understand their intent, the document
    must be construed in a manner that takes into account its commercial context. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I cannot accept the interpretation that the Vendor now seeks to
    advance. I come to this conclusion based on the following analysis.</p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court has set about explaining the approach to interpreting
    contracts in a number of recent decisions.  In <i>Dumbrell v. Regional Group of
    Companies Inc</i>., 2007 ONCA 59, 85 O.R. (3d) 616, a case involving the
    interpretation of an employment agreement, Doherty J.A. offered the following
    approach, at para. 53:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The text of the written agreement must be read as a
    whole and in the context of the circumstances as they existed when the
    agreement was created. The circumstances include facts that were known or
    reasonably capable of being known by the parties when they entered into the
    written agreement: see <i>BG Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro
    and Power Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12 at 23-24, <i>H.W. Liebig &amp; Co.
    v. Leading Investments Ltd</i>., [1986] 1 S.C.R. 70 at 80-81, La Forest J.; <i>Prenn

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his discussion of the applicable legal principles, at para.
    54, Doherty J.A. highlights his view that this contextual consideration is not
    dependent on a finding that the words themselves suggest some ambiguity, but is
    an integral part of the interpretive process:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A consideration of the context in which the written
    agreement was made is an integral part of the interpretative process and is not
    something that is resorted to only where the words viewed in isolation suggest
    some ambiguity. To find ambiguity, one must come to certain conclusions as to
    the meaning of the words used. A conclusion as to the meaning of words used in
    a written contract can only be properly reached if the contract is considered
    in the context in which it was made: see McCamus, <i>The Law of Contracts</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2005) at 710-11.</p>

    controversy as to how expansively context should be examined for the purposes
    of contractual interpretation”, but clarified that “[i]nsofar as written
    agreements are concerned, the context, or as it is sometimes called the ‘factual
    matrix’, clearly extends to the genesis of the agreement, its purpose, and the
    commercial context in which the agreement was made”.</p>

    33, Laskin J.A. specifically endorsed the <i>Dumbrell</i> approach to
    contractual interpretation in describing the process as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The goal of contractual interpretation is to
    determine the intent of the parties when the contract was made. To do so, the
    court looks at the words the parties used and the context in which the contract
    was signed. Goudge J.A. concisely summarized the proper approach to contractual
    interpretation in his reasons in <span class=italic1>Kentucky Fried Chicken
    Canada v. Scott's Food Services Inc.</span>, [1998] O.J. No. 4368 at para. 25
    (C.A.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>While the task of interpretation must begin with
    the words of the document and their ordinary meaning, the general context that
    gave birth to the document or its &quot;factual matrix&quot; will also provide
    the court with useful assistance.</p>

    that a key principle of contractual interpretation “is that the words of one
    provision must not be read in isolation but should be considered in harmony
    with the rest of the contract and in light of its purpose and commercial
    context.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I therefore begin with the words the parties used to record their
    agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is clear from the language used in paras. 2(a), 13, and 20 of
    the Agreement that the parties intended that there would be terms governing the
    Vendor’s right to extend the date for closing.  It is equally clear that there
    is a gap in the Agreement; no such terms can be found in the document.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wording contained in paras. 13 and 20, that contains general
    references to the Vendor’s entitlement to extend the closing date as
    “...permitted under this Agreement...” or “...pursuant to this Agreement...” neither
    creates a right to extend the closing date nor grants a <i>unilateral</i> right
    to the Vendor to extend the closing date. All it does is reinforce the
    conclusion that there is a deficiency in the wording of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, I agree with counsel for the Vendor that para. 2(a) is
    distinguishable from paras. 13 and 20 in that its language identifies the
    Purchaser’s right to occupancy with the unit’s readiness.  As I have said, it
    is this connection that the Vendor relies on in its submission that the need
    for the unit to be ready for occupancy is, in fact, the condition that governs
    the Vendor’s right to extend the closing date. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, there are several reasons why this interpretation cannot
    stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, a reading of the contract as a whole leads to the
    conclusion that the wording of para. 2(a) cannot be interpreted so as to
    provide the Vendor with the right to extend closing until the unit is
    substantially fit for the Purchaser’s occupancy.  If that were the intention,
    the words and the structure of the paragraph would be much different.  The
    paragraph would clearly set out that the Vendor’s right to extend closing was
    limited to the existence of an incomplete unit.  And it does not. To suggest it
    does, is, with respect, a stretch.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore, the Vendor’s position runs afoul of the basic legal
    principle that, where possible, all words in an agreement must be given meaning:
    see <i>Ventas</i>, at para. 24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here lies the Vendor’s chief problem: to interpret the Agreement
    as providing it with what would amount to a unilateral right to delay the
    closing would render meaningless the term contained in para. 20 of the
    Agreement. As previously indicated, this paragraph gives the  Purchaser the
    right to terminate the Agreement – unless the parties agree otherwise in
    writing – “[i]f the Vendor shall be unable to complete the Unit for occupancy
    by the Closing Date, as extended from time to time, pursuant to this
    agreement”. Under the interpretation the Vendor advances, if on March 20, 2009
    the unit was not substantially completed for occupancy, then the closing date would <i>become </i>the date the unit is substantially completed for occupancy. Were
    this the case, it would be impossible for the closing date to precede the date
    of unit’s substantial completion, and the Purchaser’s right of termination in
    para. 20 could never be triggered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, when the proposed transaction is considered in its
    commercial context, the Vendor’s suggested interpretation cannot, as I see it,
    be what the parties intended.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no dispute over the fact that purchases and sales of
    condominiums are commercial transactions within an industry uniquely plagued by
    delays.  These delays are caused by the market, as the sale of units in a new
    development dictates the availability of financing, by the vagaries in the
    construction process, and by the complexities associated with the registration
    process required by the <i>Condominium Act.</i>  Delays in the closing of
    condominium units are expected.  They are part of the business of developing
    condominium projects and, it follows, part of purchasing a newly-constructed
    unit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Against this background, it is quite understandable that the
    parties expressed their accord in such a way as to contemplate extensions to
    the closing date.  However, it would be absurd to interpret the Agreement as
    giving the Vendor the right to extend closing on a basis that is not only unilateral,
    but also unlimited.  Among other problems, such a right would be open to
    manipulation and abuse. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since the Agreement, read as a whole and in its commercial context,
    cannot bear the interpretation suggested by the Vendor, this ground of appeal
    must fail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I would add that, like the application judge, I do not
    see this as a case involving an ambiguous contract.  I see an unambiguous
    contract that contains a gap – an obvious lack of a term to provide guidance to
    the parties in the event that an extension to the closing date is sought.  However,
    if this gap could be said to create an ambiguity, then the principle of <i>contra
    proferentem </i>would resolve that ambiguity in favour of the Purchaser: see <i>Hillis
    Oil and Sales Ltd. v. Wynn’s Canada, Ltd.</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 57, at pp.
    68-69.</p>

    is relevant to the issue of the nature of the breach, if any, and therefore, to
    the remedy available to the Purchaser. The contention is that, since the
    Agreement contains no such clause, a time stipulation operates as a warranty
    rather than a condition. Therefore, while the Vendor’s failure to perform in a
    timely manner may entitle the Purchaser to damages, it does not release him from
    his obligations under the contract. It follows that the failure to close on
    March 20, 2009 constitutes the breach of a warranty only; the Agreement still
    exists and is subject to completion within a reasonable time.</p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I reject this argument. While the Agreement contains no “time of
    the essence” clause, para. 20 specifically provides the Purchaser with a right
    to terminate the transaction should there be a delay in the unit’s completion
    for occupancy beyond March 20, 2009.  In my view, the absence of a “time of the
    essence” clause is irrelevant as the Purchaser is invoking an enumerated contractual
    right. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At para. 25 of her reasons, the application judge addresses the
    issue of waiver, saying that “[t]he factual circumstances do not substantiate a
    finding of anticipatory breach of contract or waiver by the [Purchaser] of his
    right to terminate the Agreement.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, this finding accords with the application of the
    legal principles to the facts.  In <i>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v.
    Maritime Life Assurance Co.</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 490, <span style='color:black'>at
    p. 500, it was held that </span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>“</span><span
style='color:black'>[w]aiver will be found only where the evidence demonstrates
    that the party waiving had (1) a full knowledge of rights; and (2) an
    unequivocal and conscious intention to abandon them.” Here, the Purchaser’s
    refusal to agree with the Vendor’s proposed amendment to the Agreement supports
    a finding quite opposite to the notion that the Purchaser consciously abandoned
    his entitlement to rely on his rights under the Agreement.  Any delay in the
    Purchaser’s communicating his decision to exercise his right to terminate the
    Agreement does not change the clear position he took and does not afford the
    Vendor an opportunity to rely on waiver.</span></p>
