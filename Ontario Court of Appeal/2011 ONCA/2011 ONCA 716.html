style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Special Investigations Unit (the “SIU”) has a statutory mandate to
    conduct independent investigations into incidents involving the use of police
    force causing death or serious injury. This appeal arises from two separate
    fatal incidents involving the police. The applicants, family members of the two
    deceased, sought a declaratory judgment that, among other things, police
    officers who are involved in incidents attracting the attention of the SIU are
    not entitled to obtain legal assistance in the preparation of their notes
    regarding the incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge dismissed the application on the grounds that the
    applicants lacked standing to sue for declaratory relief and that the issues
    raised were moot and not justiciable. The appellants ask us to reverse that
    decision and to decide the application on its merits. The appellants’ position
    is supported by the respondent, the Director of the SIU.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent police officers involved in the two incidents and the
    respondent Commissioner of the OPP argue that the application judge properly
    dismissed the application and that, in any event, subsequent amendments to the
    regulation governing SIU investigations now render the appeal moot. They also
    argue that even if the application judge erred in dismissing the application on
    grounds of standing, justiciability and mootness, without a first instance
    judgment on the merits, this court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the substance
    of the application and that the matter should be returned to the Superior
    Court. The respondent officers also seek to appeal the application judge’s
    costs order holding that although they were successful on the motion to strike
    the application, they should not be awarded costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I conclude that (i) the applicants have
    standing to sue; (ii) the issues raised are justiciable, not moot; and, (iii) it
    is appropriate for this court to rule on certain substantive issues. I would
    grant a declaration to the effect that police officers involved in an SIU
    investigation do not enjoy the right to have a lawyer vet their notes or to
    assist them in the preparation of their notes. Police officers do, however,
    have the right to obtain legal advice as to the nature of their rights and
    duties with respect to SIU investigations, provided that obtaining such advice
    does not impede the completion of their notes before the end of their tour of
    duty.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LEGISLATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I set out here, in summary form, the legislative framework for SIU
    investigations and attach as Appendix A the full text of the relevant
    legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The SIU and its mandate are established
    by the <i>Police Services Act</i> R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.15, s. 113. The SIU consists of a director, who cannot be a police
    officer or a former police officer, and investigators, who cannot be current police
    officers. Under s. 113(5) of the <i>PSA</i>, the director is empowered to “cause
    investigations to be conducted into the circumstances of serious injuries and
    deaths that may have resulted from criminal offences committed by police
    officers.” The director has, under s. 113(8), the duty to report the results of
    investigations to the Attorney General and to lay information against police
    officers if there are reasonable grounds to do so, and to refer them to the
    Crown Attorney for prosecution under s.&nbsp;113(7). Police officers are also directed
    by s. 113(9)<i> to “</i></span>co-operate fully with the members of the [SIU]
    in the conduct of investigations.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario<i> Conduct and Duties of Police Officers Respecting Investigations
    by the Special Investigations Unit,</i> O. Reg 267/10, as amended by
    O.&nbsp;Reg. 283/11 (“S.I.U. Regulation”), provides further guidance in the
    application of s. 113 of the <i>PSA</i>. According to s. 3 of the SIU Regulation,
    a chief of police is required to notify the SIU “immediately” of any incident
    involving his force “that may reasonably be considered to fall within the
    investigative mandate of the SIU.” The SIU is also “the lead investigator
    holding priority over any other police force in the investigation” (s. 5) and
    the chief of police is required to ensure that the scene of an incident is
    secured for the SIU investigators (s. 4). </p>

    officers, right to counsel, interviews, note-making and the designation of
    subject and witness officers are central to this appeal, I set out those
    sections of the SIU Regulation in full here. I have italicized those provisions

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 22, 2009, the respondent, Constable Graham Seguin, responded to
    a call concerning an alleged assault committed by Douglas Minty, a 59 year old
    developmentally disabled man. Minty then approached Seguin holding a knife.
    Seguin ordered Minty to drop the knife. Minty did not comply and continued to
    approach Seguin. Seguin fired five shots at Minty and Minty died shortly thereafter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sergeant Michael Burton, Seguin’s senior officer, and two other officers
    soon arrived. Burton advised all of the officers that they could be designated
    as witness officers by the SIU, that they should make no further notes until
    after they had spoken to legal counsel and that Ontario Provincial Police
    (“OPP”) procedure required them to complete their notes before the end of their
    shift. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SIU arrived one hour and 23 minutes after the shooting. Seguin was
    designated as the subject officer and the others, including Burton, were
    designated as witness officers. Andrew MacKay, a lawyer frequently consulted by
    the police in relation to SIU investigations, acted as counsel for all of the officers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SIU Director, Ian Scott, reported to the Attorney General on the Minty
    incident on October 14, 2009. Scott’s report stated that there were no
    reasonable grounds to believe that Seguin had committed a criminal offence in
    relation to the death of Minty. He indicated, however, that he would address
    certain issues and apparent breaches of the SIU Regulation with the OPP
    Commissioner, namely: (1) the delayed notification to the SIU of the incident
    (contrary to s. 3 of the SIU Regulation); (2) that one of the OPP officers had
    taken statements from material civilian witnesses (contrary to s. 5 of the SIU Regulation);
    and, (3) that Burton had instructed all witness officers not to write their
    notes until after they spoke to counsel, a counsel who acted for all clients
    and had a professional duty to share information among his clients (contrary to
    s. 6 of the SIU Regulation, which requires witness officers to be segregated.)</p>
  <h3><i>The Schaeffer investigation</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 24, 2009, Constable Kris Wood and Acting Sergeant Pullbrook were
    investigating a boat theft at Pickle Lake. Levi Schaeffer, a 32 year old man
    diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, panic disorder and anti-social
    personality disorder, was camping in the area.  Schaeffer had a knife. Wood and
    Pullbrook attempted to arrest Schaeffer and an altercation ensued. Constable Wood
    fired his gun twice at Schaeffer, killing him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wood and Pullbrook were advised by their senior officer not to speak to
    each other about the incident, to contact their legal counsel and to delay
    making their notebook entries until they had consulted with counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approximately five hours after the shooting, Wood consulted his lawyer, Andrew
    McKay. MacKay asked Wood to prepare notes for him to review. MacKay reviewed
    those notes, and, according to the officer’s notes, MacKay advised Wood that they
    were “excellent and to complete notebook.” Wood completed his notes two days
    after the incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pullbrook also consulted McKay, speaking to him by telephone
    approximately six hours after the incident. MacKay advised him not to complete
    his notebook but to provide MacKay with notes of the incident. After receiving
    legal advice from MacKay on the notes prepared for counsel to review, Pullbrook
    completed his notebook on June 26, 2009, two days after the incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wood and Pullbrook declined to produce their written communications with
    their lawyer to the SIU on grounds of solicitor-client privilege. However,
    Pullbrook told the SIU that MacKay advised “that there were not significant
    differences in the confidential notes that were provided to counsel and the
    notes that were presented to the [SIU] investigators”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SIU Director Scott reported the result of the investigation to the
    Attorney General on September 25, 2009, stating that there were no reasonable
    grounds to believe that Wood had committed a criminal offence. However, Scott
    expressed serious concerns over the manner in which Wood and Pullbrook had
    completed their notes. He stated that he could not “place sufficient reliance
    on the information provided” by the two officers for the following reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This note writing
    process flies in the face of the two main indicators of reliability of notes:
    independence and contemporaneity. The notes do not represent an independent
    recitation of the material events. The first drafts have been ‘approved’ by an
    OPPA [Ontario Provincial Police Association] lawyer who represented all of the
    involved officers in this matter, a lawyer who has a professional obligation to
    share information among his clients when jointly retained by them. Nor are the
    notes the most contemporaneous ones – they were not written as soon as
    practicable and the first drafts remain in the custody of their lawyer. I am
    denied the opportunity to compare the first draft with the final entries.
    Accordingly, the only version of the material events are association lawyer
    approved notes. Due to their lack of independence and contemporaneity, I cannot
    rely upon these notes nor A/Sgt Pullbrook’s interview based upon them for the
    truth of their contents.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have a statutory responsibility to conduct
    independent investigations and decide whether a police officer probably
    committed a criminal offence. In this most serious case, I have no information
    base I can rely upon. Because I cannot conclude what probably happened, I
    cannot form reasonable grounds that the subject officer in this matter
    committed a criminal offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OPP conducted two internal investigations of the Schaeffer incident.
    Chief Superintendent Ken Smith, Bureau Commander for the Professional Standards
    Bureau, concluded that Constable Wood had used appropriate force in shooting
    Schaeffer. Smith observed that while s. 7 of the SIU Regulation recognizes that
    officers involved in an SIU investigation enjoy the right to counsel, that
    right “does not negate the member’s responsibility as stated in Police Orders
    to complete their notes in respect of on duty activities prior to the end of
    shift or as authorized by their supervisor.”  Smith also observed that
    supervisors should not “direct members to contact legal counsel prior to making
    their required Duty book entries but to advise them of their legislated right
    to speak to counsel” and that “[a]ppropriate opportunity should be provided for
    our members to complete this communication.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second investigation concluded that Wood and Pullbrook did not
    complete their duty notes before the end of their shift as required by OPP
    policy, but that there was no breach of OPP policy in the officers’ refusal to
    provide their “counsel reviewed notes” on the ground that those notes were
    subject to solicitor-client privilege.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE
    APPLICATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application giving rise to this appeal was commenced in November
    2009. The application requests declaratory relief requiring the court to
    interpret the legislation and regulation with respect to a list of issues
    involving the rights and duties of police officers involved in SIU
    investigations. For the purpose of this appeal, the key issues raised by the
    application are: does the legislation, expressly or impliedly, authorize or
    permit: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the subject and witness officers to share the same lawyer who,
    under the Law Society’s Rules of Professional Conduct, is duty bound to share
    all relevant information as between his clients;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the subject and witness officers to prepare and submit their
    notebook notes after having the notes reviewed by jointly retained counsel; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the subject and witness officers to create two sets of police
    notes, a solicitor`s draft (never shared with the SIU) and a second draft
    which, after having been vetted by their lawyer, is provided to the SIU; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>supervising officers, as a matter of course, to authorize subject
    and witness officers to refrain from preparing their notes to permit
    consultation with counsel and regardless of the expiry of the officer`s shift.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There can be little doubt that when the matter was before the application
    judge, the central issue was the propriety of joint retainers. However, it is
    also clear that the issue of officers having their notes vetted by a lawyer was
    also raised. While the application raised a number of other specific issues
    relating to particular aspects of the two investigations, the issues have been
    effectively narrowed to those I have indentified above. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DECISION
    OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent officers brought a motion to strike the application on
    the grounds that it was not justiciable and that the applicants lacked
    standing. The Master refused the respondents’ request that the motion to strike
    the application be heard first and ordered that that motion be set down for
    hearing at the same time as the application itself. Accordingly, the parties
    went before the application judge with a complete record on the substantive
    issues raised. The application judge refused the applicants’ request that she
    defer her decision on the motion to strike the application until after she had
    dealt with the substance of the application. She gave her ruling on the motion to
    strike without expressing any views as to the merits of the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge observed that the issues raised by the application
    had been the subject of lively debate involving the various interested parties
    and the subject of reports commissioned by the Attorney General. She reviewed
    the history of that debate including the 2003 Report on the SIU prepared by the
    Honourable George Adams and the 2008 Report of Ombudsman André Marin. Both
    reports discussed and criticized the practice of witness and subject officers
    consulting the same lawyer prior to completing their notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found, at para. 57, that “[t]he issue lies at the
    intersection of a number of values, interests and rights that are not easily
    balanced.” She considered the issue of the appropriate balance to be a matter
    for the legislature and concluded, at para. 61, that “it is not the function of
    this court to act as a policy maker of last resort.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also found that the applicants had neither private
    nor public interest standing to seek declaratory relief. With respect to
    private interest standing, she stated, at para. 67, that there was “no legal
    nexus between the applicants and the respondent officers” and that the
    applicants were simply “one group of citizens saying of another group of
    citizens: they have conducted themselves unlawfully, and we seek the court’s
    concurrence on that opinion.” With respect to public interest standing, she
    characterized the retention of counsel by police officers, at para. 86, as “the
    exercise of a private right” arising in the course of the officer’s employment
    that did not call into question the validity of a statute or the legality of administrative
    action. The application judge also held that there were several other effective
    ways to bring the issue before the courts, namely, an action for misfeasance of
    public office or a complaint against the lawyer retained by the officers for
    professional misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also concluded, at para. 71, that “[t]he actions
    of the police officers are spent and the issues are moot. No practical interest
    and no legal interest of the applicants is engaged in the application.” </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>MOTION TO
    QUASH THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent officers moved, in advance of the date set for the oral
    hearing of this appeal, to quash the paragraph in the notice of appeal asking
    this court to grant the declaratory relief sought in the application. They
    argued that as an appellate court we lack jurisdiction to entertain that issue
    without a ruling from the Superior Court on the substance of the application.
    The panel that heard the motion to quash ruled that it should be deferred to
    the panel hearing the appeal and that the parties should come to the appeal
    ready to argue the merits: <i>Schaeffer v. Woods, </i>2011 ONCA 116.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>AMENDMENTS
    TO THE SIU REGULATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SIU Regulation was amended after the application was struck and
    after this appeal was perfected, but before the oral hearing of the appeal.
    These amendments were made on the recommendation of the Honourable Patrick J.
    LeSage who had been retained by the Attorney General to review certain issues
    concerning SIU investigations involving “the conduct and duties of officers in
    SIU investigations, including the right to counsel and note-taking”. The LeSage
    review was not a public process and did not purport to engage in an in-depth
    review or analysis of the issues. It is aptly described in the factum of the SIU
    Director as a “facilitated consultation process”. LeSage was directed to
    conduct his review as he saw fit, but on the basis that it was “understood
    between the parties that the focus will be on small, by-invitation sessions.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>LeSage rendered a three-page report making a number of recommendations.
    The recommendations relevant to this appeal are as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Right to Counsel</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section
    7 of O.Reg. 267/10 is clear. All officers have the right to counsel.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>My recommendation is
    that Regulation 267/10 be amended to provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>7.(1) Subject to
    subsection (2), every police officer is entitled to consult with legal counsel
    or a representative of a police association and to have legal counsel or a
    representative of a police association present during his or her interview with
    the SIU.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i) <u>Witness
    officers may not be represented by the same legal counsel as subject officers.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Officer’s
    Notes</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I
    recommend that section 9 of O.Reg. 267/10 be amended to add the following
    subsection:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>9.(5) <u>The notes
    made pursuant to subsections (1) and (3) shall be completed by the end of the
    officer’s tour of duty, except where excused by the chief of police.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I
    also recommend that section 6 of O.Reg 267/10 be amended to read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>6.(2)&nbsp;A police officer involved
    in the incident shall not communicate <u>directly or indirectly </u>with any
    other police officer involved in the incident concerning their involvement in
    the incident until after the SIU has completed its interviews.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SIU Regulation was amended in accordance with those recommendations.
    The LeSage report also recommended changes to the Law Society’s Rules of
    Professional Conduct to state that lawyers representing more than one officer
    in an SIU investigation are reminded of their duty not to undermine s. 6 of the
    SIU Regulation by disclosing to one officer-client anything said by another
    involved in the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent officers brought another motion to quash the appeal on
    the ground that the amendments to the SIU Regulation adopting the LeSage
    recommendations rendered the appeal moot. That motion was heard at the same
    time as the appeal itself. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues to be decided may be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>1. Do the applicants have standing to bring the
    application?</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>2. Are the issues raised by the application
    justiciable?</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>3. Are the issues raised by the application moot?</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>4. If the applicants have standing and the appeal is
    justiciable and not moot, does this court have jurisdiction to decide the
    substantive issues?</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>5. Are officers entitled to the assistance of counsel
    in the preparation of their notes?</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>6. Cross-appeal as to costs</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%'>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1. Do the
    applicants have standing to bring the application?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the applicants submit that they have both private and public
    interest standing to bring the application, I view the issue of public interest
    standing as dispositive and accordingly, need not consider private interest
    standing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common ground on this appeal that the discretionary recognition of
    public interest standing involves consideration of three aspects: (1) that
    there is a serious issue as to the invalidity of a statute or as to whether an
    administrative action exceeds the limits of statutory authority; (2) that the
    party seeking standing is directly affected or has a genuine interest in the
    issue; and, (3) that there is no other reasonable and effective manner to bring
    the issue before the courts. See <i>Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance</i>),
    [1986] 2 S.C.R. 607; <i>Borowski v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, [1981] 2
    S.C.R. 575.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge erred in law in her assessment of the
    application of this three-part test to the facts of this case. First, the
    application judge erred in characterizing the issue of whether police officers
    involved in an SIU investigation have the right to the assistance of counsel in
    the preparation of their notes as purely a matter of a private right arising in
    the course of the officer’s employment. The definition and exercise of rights
    and duties of police officers involved in such investigations have significant
    consequences for the public at large. The definition and content of those
    rights and duties turns on the interpretation of legislation. The appellants’ argue
    that the practice of vetting notes of an incident with counsel rests on the
    assertion that such practice is contrary to the legislation. By extending the
    scope of public interest standing to non-constitutional challenges to the
    legality of administrative authority, the Supreme Court prevented “the
    immunization of legislation or public acts from any challenge” <i><span
style='color:black'>Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of
    Employment and Immigration)</span><span style='color:black'>,</span></i><span
style='color:black'> [1992] 1 S.C.R. 236, at para. 36</span>. That purpose is
    met in this case by allowing the appellants to advance their claim for
    declaratory relief. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellants present a strong case that they are directly
    affected by, and have genuine interest in, the issues raised by the
    application. The appellants are family members of the individuals whose deaths
    were investigated and the conduct of which they complain was found by the
    Director of the SIU to undermine the integrity of the investigation. The
    appellants have suffered immeasurable losses and to be told that their losses
    cannot be fully investigated because of the very conduct they seek to challenge,
    is sufficient to demonstrate that they are directly affected by, and have a
    genuine interest in, the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, it is simply not the case that an action for misfeasance of
    public office or a complaint to the Law Society constitute other reasonable and
    effective manners to bring the issue before the courts. The tort of misfeasance
    of public office is difficult to establish and requires proof of deliberate
    wrongdoing. It is far from certain that the issue of statutory interpretation
    the appellants seek to have resolved would be reached in such an action. Moreover,
    the contention that police officers are not entitled to legal assistance in the
    preparation of their notes does not necessarily engage the Law Society’s Rules
    of Professional Conduct. Even if it did, the route to the courts via judicial
    review would be problematic, to say the least, as the appellants would not be
    parties to the Law Society proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While a determination as to standing involves the exercise of
    discretion, the errors of law made by the application judge are sufficient to
    justify appellate intervention. I would set aside the ruling that the
    appellants lack public interest standing and hold that public interest standing
    is made out in this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2. </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'> Are the issues raised by the application
    justiciable?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge erred in concluding that the issues
    raised by the application were not justiciable. The matter of SIU
    investigations has certainly been contentious, hotly debated and the subject of
    numerous reviews, reports and policy debates. However, the legislative process
    has engaged those issues and a legislated regime to govern SIU investigations
    has now been established. The applicants simply ask for the court’s
    interpretation of what the legislation does, and does not, allow in the context
    of a specific factual record emerging from two SIU investigations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the legal regime the court is being asked to interpret was
    shaped by policy considerations and the need to balance competing interests,
    does not, and cannot, preclude the court from exercising its customary role of
    interpreting the legal instruments that the legislature has provided. The SIU
    Regulation provides a legal framework for the exercise of the court’s
    adjudicative authority. This authority cannot be ousted by virtue of the fact
    that policy debates about SIU investigations continue. Where policy issues
    provide “the context for, rather than the substance of, the questions before
    the Court”, the matter is justiciable: <i>Reference re Same-Sex Marriage</i>, 2004
    SCC 79, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698 at para. 10. As Le Dain J. stated in <i>Finlay</i> at
    para. 33, “where there is an issue which is appropriate for judicial
    determination the courts should not decline to determine it on the ground that
    because of its policy context or implications it is better left for review and
    determination by the legislative or executive branches of government.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.  </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Are the issues raised by the application
    moot?</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with the application judge’s conclusion that “the actions
    of the police officers are spent and the issues are moot” and that “[n]o
    practical interest and no legal interest of the applicants is engaged in the
    application”. A case is moot “if, subsequent to the initiation of the action or
    proceeding, events occur which affect the relationship of the parties so that
    no present live controversy exists which affects the rights of the parties”: <i>Borowski </i>at p. 353. Even if the case is moot, the court has discretion to entertain
    it in certain circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge’s conclusion appears to have been largely driven
    by her approach to justiciability and standing. The legality of the conduct of
    the police involved in SIU investigations remains a live issue and, because I
    have concluded that the appellants have public interest standing to raise that
    issue, the case is not moot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent officers and Commissioner submit that the amendments to
    the SIU Regulation following the LeSage Report also render the appeal moot. In
    my view, the amendments do render the issue of double retainer moot but they do
    not render moot the issue of whether police officers involved in SIU
    investigations are entitled to obtain legal advice in the preparation of their
    notes. The SIU Regulation, as amended, plainly does not answer that question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of double retainer was the central issue when the application
    was brought and while it is now off the table, I do not agree that that renders
    the entire appeal moot. Contrary to the submission of the respondents, the
    application squarely raised the issue of whether police officers involved in
    SIU investigations are entitled to legal advice in connection with the
    preparation of their notes. As that issue remains a live one, I would not
    dismiss this appeal on the grounds that it is moot. </p>

    decide the application on the merits. The respondent officers and Commissioner
    submit that even if the appellants have standing and the issues are neither
    moot nor not justiciable, this court lacks jurisdiction because the application
    judge declined to consider the case on the merits and struck the application
    without making any substantive ruling. There is therefore no “final order of a
    judge of the Superior Court of Justice” on the issues the appellant raise as is
    necessary to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O., c. C.43, s. 6(1)(b). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, supported by the respondent Director of the SIU, rely on

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the broad language of s. 134(1) permits us to deal with the
    substantive issues raised by the application in the particular circumstances of
    this case. We have jurisdiction to make any order that the application judge “ought
    to or could have” made and we are directed to make any “order or decision that
    is considered just.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, despite this broad language, this court will be reluctant to
    make any order concerning a matter that has not been the subject of an order
    from the tribunal appealed from. In particular, this court is ill-equipped to
    make factual findings without the benefit of a full record and findings from
    the tribunal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as I have already noted, when the application judge decided the
    motion to strike the application, the substantial record for the application
    itself was complete. There was an order that the motion to strike be heard at
    the same time as that set for the hearing of the application itself. Had she
    not struck the application, the application judge would have immediately
    proceeded to deal with the substance of the matter. There are no factual issues
    in dispute before this court. This is not a case where <i>viva voce</i> evidence is required or where there are issues of credibility to resolve. The
    issues are questions of pure law and statutory interpretation. Given the
    history and highly contentious nature of the issues, returning this case to the
    Superior Court would almost certainly not end the matter. A further appeal to
    this court seems virtually inevitable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, in these circumstances, the conditions specified by s. 134(1)
    have been met and we should exercise our discretion to deal with the substance
    of the application. Plainly, the application judge “could have” made the order
    the appellants seek. Moreover, the practical considerations of avoiding
    unnecessary delay and cost strongly favour resolution in this court on this
    appeal. We have a complete record, there are no outstanding factual issues and
    we have had the benefit of full argument. In my view, it is “just” to deal with
    the substance of the cases now. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span

    of two key provisions in the SIU Regulation relating to the preparation of the
    notes by officers involved in incidents attracting SIU investigations and the
    right to counsel that is accorded to such officers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The specific relief sought in the Notice of Application on this issue,
    is a declaration interpreting s. 113(9) of the <i>PSA</i> and the SIU
    Regulation to determine whether the legislation expressly or impliedly
    authorizes: (1) “[t]he subject and witness officers creating two sets of police
    notes: a solicitor’s draft (never shared with the S.I.U.) and a second draft
    which, having been vetted by their lawyer, is provided to the S.I.U.;” and, (2)
    “supervising O.P.P. officers, as a matter of course…to authorize involved
    officers (both subject and witness officers) to refrain from preparing their

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants and the respondent Director of the SIU, supported by
    three interveners, the Criminal Lawyers Association, the Canadian Civil
    Liberties Association and the Urban Alliance for Race Relations, submit that to
    comply with their duty under s. 9 of the SIU Regulation, officers must prepare
    their notes immediately and prior to any consultation with counsel. The
    respondent officers, also supported by three interveners, Andrew McKay, the
    Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police and the Police Association of Ontario,
    submit that s. 7 of the SIU Regulation gives the officers the right to consult
    counsel in connection with the preparation of their notes, as occurred in the
    two cases that give rise to this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Commissioner of the OPP takes a nuanced position. In
    para. 47 of his factum, the Commissioner submits that s. 7(1) entitles officers
    to consult counsel prior to making their notes but agrees with the appellants
    and Director of the SIU that notes should be independent and contemporaneous.
    The Commissioner insists that the notes be “completed in accordance with policy”,
    that “[o]fficers should not collaborate in their notes” and “[c]ounsel should
    neither be vetting notes, nor amending, varying or suggesting changes to notes.
    There should be only one set of notes.”</p>
  <h3><i>Legislative purpose</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the statutory and regulatory provisions relating to SIU
    investigations is to ensure the independent and accountable investigation of
    the use of police force causing death or serious injury and to foster public
    confidence in such investigations and in the integrity of the police. I agree
    with the observation of MacKenzie J. in <i>Metcalf v. Scott,</i> 2011 ONSC 1292
    (S.C.J.) at para. 91, that the legislation governing SIU investigations should
    be interpreted in a manner that “provides complainants with a mechanism for an
    impartial and independent review of complaints and thereby enhances public
    confidence and trust in the administration of justice.” As the Director of the
    SIU puts it in his factum, at para. 64:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The legislative purpose
    underlying the <i>PSA </i>and the SIU Regulation is clear and unequivocal: to
    maintain and foster public confidence in the rule of law and the administration
    of justice by ensuring that when police actions result in the death of or
    serious injury to civilians, they are subject to an independent, impartial and
    effective investigation the conclusions of which are accessible and
    transparent.</p>
  <h3><i>Legislative context</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With this legislative purpose in mind, I turn to consider the right to
    counsel conferred by s. 7(1) and the duty to create notes imposed by s. 9 in
    the light of the purpose and context of the legislative scheme. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director of the SIU relies upon the frequently quoted passage from
    Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5th ed.
    (Markham, ON: LexisNexis, 2008)<i> </i>at p. 223 for the well-established
    proposition that the proper approach to statutory interpretation is contextual
    and purposive, an approach that is informed by the presumption of coherence.
    Sullivan elaborates stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is presumed the
    provisions of legislation are meant to work together, both logically and
    teleologically, as parts of a functioning whole. The parts are presumed to fit
    together logically to form a rational, internally consistent framework; and
    because the framework has a purpose, the parts are also presumed to work
    together dynamically, each contributing something toward accomplishing the
    intended goal. This presumption is the basis for analyzing legislative schemes,
    which is often the most persuasive form of analysis. The presumption of
    coherence is also expressed as a presumption against internal conflict. It is presumed
    that the body of legislation enacted by a legislature does not contain
    contradictions or inconsistencies, that each provision is capable of operating
    without coming into conflict with any other.</p>
  <h3><i>The right to counsel</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By conferring upon police officers the right “to consult with legal
    counsel” in connection with SIU investigations, s. 7(1) significantly enhances
    the rights of both witness and subject officers beyond the rights enjoyed by
    ordinary citizens in relation to police investigations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The right to retain and instruct counsel conferred by s. 10(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i> arises upon arrest or detention. While witness and
    subject officers are segregated pursuant to s. 6 of the SIU Regulation pending
    interview by SIU investigators, segregation amounts to neither arrest nor
    detention. But for s. 7(1), police officers would enjoy no specific statutory right
    to consult counsel in connection with an SIU investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, by providing that witness and subject officers are entitled “to
    have legal counsel or a representative of a police association present during
    his or her interview with the SIU”, s. 7(1) also confers a right not accorded
    to ordinary citizens who do not enjoy the right to have counsel present when
    interviewed or interrogated by the police: see <i>R. v. Sinclair, </i>2010 SCC
    35, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 310. Undoubtedly, police officers are accorded this
    enhanced right to counsel because, unlike the ordinary citizen in the ordinary situation,
    police officers do not enjoy the right to silence in the face of an SIU
    investigation. They instead have a statutory obligation to cooperate in the SIU
    investigation, to prepare their notes and to submit to an SIU interview.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The<i> right </i>to counsel conferred by s. 7(1), however, cannot be absolute
    or without limit. Even the constitutional right to counsel conferred by s.
    10(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> is subject to
    reasonable limitation which need not be explicitly stated in legislation. The
    right to counsel may be limited by implication, either from the terms of
    legislation or by virtue of its practical application:<span style='color:black'> see, for example, <i>R. v. Thomsen</i> </span><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:-.15pt'>[1988] 1 S.C.R. 640 which held that a law providing for
    a roadside breathalyser test and requiring that the sample be provided forthwith
    implicitly limits the right to counsel; see also </span><i><span
style='color:black'>R. v. Orbanski</span></i><span style='color:black'>; <i>R. v.
    Elias,</i> 2005 SCC 37, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 3 at para. 52.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The s. 7(1) right to counsel does not operate stand in isolation. Its precise
    meaning must be discerned with reference to the other provisions of the SIU
    Regulation dealing with SIU investigations and a view to achieving a harmonious
    and coherent interpretation of the entire scheme.</p>
  <h3><i>Police officers’ duty to make notes </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 9 reinforces the duty of officers “to complete in full the notes
    on the incident <i>in</i> <i>accordance with his or her duty</i>” [emphasis
    added]. Applying the contextual and purposive approach that is informed by the
    presumption of coherence, I conclude that it would be wrong to interpret s.
    7(1) in a manner that would undermine or contradict, the duty imposed by s. 9.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common ground on this appeal that the duty to create independent
    and contemporaneous notes of events that transpire during a police officer’s
    ordinary duties is fundamental to the professional role of a police officer. In
    his <i>Report of the Taman Inquiry </i>(Library and Archives Canada, 2008) at p.
    133, Commissioner Roger Salhany, Q.C. aptly described note-taking as “an
    integral part of a successful investigation and prosecution of an accused” and
    stated that “the preparation of accurate, detailed and comprehensive notes as
    soon as possible after an event has been investigated is the duty and
    responsibility of a competent investigator.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OPP Orders confirm officers’ professional obligation to take “concise,
    comprehensive particulars of each occurrence” during an officer’s tour of duty: <i>Ontario Provincial Police Orders</i>, June 2009 Revision, at s. 2.50.3. Police
    officers are trained that their “[n]otes must contain your independent
    recollections providing an accurate and complete account of police observations
    and activities” and that “entries are to be made during or as close to the
    investigation as possible”: Ontario Police College, <i>Basic Constable Training
    Program (Student Workbook—Evidence) 2008</i>, at pp. 2, 8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reliable independent and contemporaneous police officer notes are
    central to the integrity of the administration of criminal justice. Police
    officers’ notes provide the basis for laying charges and they provide Crown
    Attorneys with a record upon which to base decisions regarding the prosecution
    of the case. Furthermore, in the post-<i>Stinchcombe</i> era of mandatory Crown
    disclosure, police notes provide the accused and his or her counsel with vital
    information to inform decisions as to how to plead and how to conduct of the
    defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police officer’s notes are also used to assist the officer in
    testifying at trial. When used for that purpose, it is vitally important to the
    reliability and integrity of the officer’s evidence that the notes used record
    the officer’s own independent recollection. In <i>R. v. Green</i>, [1998] O.J.
    No. 3598 (O.C.J. (Gen. Div.) at para. 20, Malloy J. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An officer’s notes perform a valuable function at
    trial. It is usually many months, sometimes years, from the time of an
    occurrence to the time that the officer is called upon to testify at trial.
    Without the assistance of notes to refresh his or her memory, the evidence of
    the officer at trial would inevitably be sketchy at best. If the officer’s
    notes are prepared without any indication of which is the officer’s independent
    recollection and which is somebody else’s recollection, there is every
    likelihood that that officer at trial will be “refreshing” his or her own
    memory with observations made by someone else. In effect, the officer will be
    giving hearsay evidence as if it was his or her own recollection rather than
    the observations of somebody else written into the notes without attribution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no suggestion that it is the practice of police officers to
    consult with legal counsel before preparing their notes in non-SIU
    investigations. That is hardly surprising. The use of legal counsel to advise
    or assist in the preparation of notes would be inconsistent with the purpose of
    police notes and with the duty imposed on police officers to prepare them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the submission of the Criminal Lawyers Association that the
    problem posed by a police officer seeking legal assistance before preparing his
    or her notes is not that the lawyer would do anything improper. Instead, the
    concern is that seeking legal advice is geared to the officer’s own
    self-interest, or the interests of fellow officers, rather than the officer’s
    overriding public duty. Police officers are public office holders who have “a
    general duty to prevent and investigate crime [that is] recognized at common
    law and given statutory force” by the <i>PSA</i> in s. 42: <i>R. v. Simpson</i> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 182 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 489. Note-taking is a core element
    of that public duty. Focusing on the officer’s private interests rather than
    the interest of the SIU investigation is inconsistent with the officer’s public
    duty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without imputing any impropriety to a lawyer asked to advise a police
    officer regarding note preparation or review, a lawyer’s involvement undermines
    the fundamental nature and purpose of a police officer’s notes. A lawyer would
    only be doing his or her job in providing the police officer with information
    as to the ingredients of an offence or possible legal defence. Such advice is
    likely to influence how the police officer writes his notes. Consequently, the
    notes would not be a straightforward record of the officer’s independent
    recollection but would reflect the lawyer’s legal advice. An officer eager to
    have a sound basis for a prosecution or a legally valid explanation for his or
    her own conduct would naturally emphasize and present the facts in accordance
    with the lawyer’s advice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the lawyer-induced refinements or qualifications that would
    almost certainly flow from lawyer involvement in the note-making process would
    undermine the very purpose of a police officer’s notes, namely, to record the
    officer’s independent and contemporaneous record of the incident. It follows
    that a police officer who seeks legal advice in connection with the preparation
    of notes, other than with respect to the obligation to prepare notes, or who
    asks legal counsel to review or vet notes. fails to live up to this duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, s. 9(5) requires an officer to complete his or her notes “by
    the end of the officer’s tour of duty, except where excused by the chief of
    police.” This provision was introduced as a result of the LeSage Report, but
    before its introduction, it was OPP policy that officers complete their notes
    prior to the end of their shift. An officer is duty-bound to complete the notes
    immediately and while the officer is still on the same tour of duty that led to
    the incident giving rise to the SIU investigation.  This duty is, therefore,
    inconsistent with the proposition that the police officer is entitled to await
    the arrival of counsel and to obtain the assistance of counsel in the
    preparation of the notes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Holding that the s. 7(1) right to counsel does not to permit officers to
    obtain legal assistance in the preparation of notes also gives effect to the
    overarching purpose of the legislation – the preservation and promotion of
    independence, accountability, and public confidence in the investigation of
    police use of deadly force. Limiting the reach of s. 7(1) in this way achieves
    a coherent and harmonious interpretation of the entire regulation, thereby striking
    an appropriate balance between the right to counsel and the duty to make
    independent and contemporaneous notes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreting s. 7(1) to require officers to complete their notes without
    the assistance of counsel certainly does not denude s. 7(1) of meaning. As I
    have already noted, the right to consult counsel prior to being interviewed by
    the SIU and the right to have counsel present during the SIU interview
    represents a significant enhancement of the rights the officers would otherwise
    enjoy. Thus, the interpretation I have offered assures that the SIU
    investigators will have the same reliable record of the incident that is available
    in any investigation, but at the same time, that the officers will have the benefit
    of legal counsel before and during the SIU interview. Moreover, as I will
    explain below, it is my view that an officer is also entitled to obtain some
    legal advice prior to making his or her notes provided that advice can be
    obtained without delay and subject to the limitation that the advice not relate
    to the content of the notes the officer is required to prepare. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, this interpretation is consistent with the balance of rights
    and interests reflected by provisions in the SIU Regulation that protect the
    rights of subject officers. The <i>PSA</i> and the SIU Regulation require the
    police officer to cooperate with the SIU and, in return, the police officer is
    afforded certain rights and protections required to give effect to the right
    against self-incrimination. Section 9(3) provides that the subject officer’s
    notes are not to be provided to the SIU. If an officer originally designated as
    a witness officer becomes a subject officer, that officer’s notes must be
    returned by the SIU to the chief of police and the record of the officer’s SIU
    interview returned to the officer in accordance with s. 10(3) of the SIU
    Regulation. Moreover, it is accepted by the Attorney General that the notes and
    interviews of subject officers are involuntary statements that may not be used
    to incriminate the subject officer. This protection extends to derivative use
    immunity to preclude the use of any evidence that would not be found but for
    the notes or interviews: Ontario, <i>Review report on the Special
    Investigations Unit reforms prepared for the Attorney General by the Honourable
    George W. Adams, Q.C. </i>(Toronto: Ministry of the Attorney General, 2003), at

    and all</i> consultation with a lawyer prior to the officer making his notes.
    For the following reasons, I would grant a declaration in terms that are quite similar
    to the position taken by the Commissioner of the OPP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the Notice of Application asks for a declaration that officers
    not be permitted to have a lawyer review or vet their notes and that the SIU
    Regulation does not permit a supervising officer to authorize officers to
    refrain from preparing their notes until after the expiry of the police officer’s
    shift to permit consultation with counsel. The Notice of Application does not
    ask for a declaration precluding an officer from any consultation with a lawyer
    prior to the completion of the officer’s notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, while relief in those terms was addressed during oral argument,
    I am not persuaded that relief in such broad terms would be justified. There is
    nothing explicit or implicit in the SIU Regulation that would deny a police officer
    who finds himself or herself in the stressful situation of having been involved
    in an incident attracting the attention of the SIU the right to some basic
    legal advice as to the nature of his or her rights and obligations in
    connection with the incident and the SIU investigation. The officer is entitled
    to legal advice on matters such as the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he or she is required to complete notes of the incident prior to
    the end of his or her tour of duty unless excused by the chief of police; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the lawyer cannot advise the officer what to include in the notes
    other than that they should provide a full and honest record of the officer’s
    recollection of the incident in the officer’s own words</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the notes are to be submitted to the Chief of Police; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>if the officer is a subject officer, the Chief of Police will not
    pass the notes on to the SIU;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>if the officer is a witness officer, the Chief of Police will
    pass the notes on to the SIU;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the officer will be required to answer questions from the SIU
    investigators;  the officer will be entitled to consult counsel prior to the
    SIU interview and to have counsel present during the interview. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Advice of this nature can readily and quickly be given and received by
    telephone. However, if legal counsel is not available to advise the officer,
    the officer must complete the notes prior to the end of his or her tour of duty
    as required by s. 9(5) and that period cannot be extended for the purpose of
    getting legal advice: <i>R. v. Thomsen</i><span style='color:#3A3A3A;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject the submission that because solicitor-client privilege will
    shield from the court’s view the legal advice given to officers, we should not
    permit any consultation with a lawyer until after the notes have been
    completed. As both counsel for the respondent officers and counsel for the
    Criminal Lawyers Association submitted, lawyers have an ethical obligation to
    advise clients in accordance with the law. I have confidence in the ethical
    standards of the legal profession and I am confident that a lawyer called upon to
    give the type of advice I have outlined in these reasons would not misuse or
    abuse the opportunity by providing improper assistance with regard to the content
    of the officer’s notes.</p>
