  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After approximately a 15-day hearing before the sentencing judge, the
    appellant was declared to be a dangerous offender and sentenced to an
    indeterminate sentence in the penitentiary.  He appeals from the sentence
    imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his factum, the appellant attacked his designation as a dangerous
    offender on multiple fronts, arguing that he should have been found to be a
    long-term offender.  However, during oral argument, his challenge to the
    sentence imposed focussed primarily on two alleged errors by the sentencing
    judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>misapprehension
    of the evidence regarding the appellant’s willingness to take Lupron, an
    anti-androgen drug, as a treatment modality for helping to control the risk to
    the public to be posed by the appellant on release to the community; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    impermissible admission of expert reply psychiatric evidence tendered by the
    Crown and the improper use of this evidence by the sentencing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, these grounds of appeal cannot succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge concluded that, given the appellant’s admitted
    lengthy pattern of deceitfulness and manipulation of his victims, caregivers
    and parole supervisors, there was serious reason to doubt whether he would take
    Lupron as a condition of his eventual release into the community.  This finding
    was open to the sentencing judge on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, the record amply supports the sentencing judge’s finding
    that, “When his parole ran out, so did his use of Lupron, and no reasonable
    effort was made by him in the next several years to do anything with Lupron but
    enhance his image with his supervisors.”  Similarly, there is an evidentiary
    foundation for the sentencing judge’s finding that the appellant falsely
    claimed to be pursuing Lupron treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its case-in-chief, the Crown led opinion evidence from a forensic
    psychiatrist and a psychologist, both of whom offered opinions as to the
    possible containment of the appellant’s risk of sexually re-offending in the
    community.  In their view, the appellant was at very high risk for sexually
    violent recidivism, on both clinical and actuarial testing measures.  Dr.
    Woodside, for example, described the appellant as posing roughly triple the
    degree of risk posed by the average sex offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence expert agreed with this high risk assessment but expressed a
    more optimistic view of the chances of managing the appellant’s risk in the
    community at tolerable levels by the employment of a multi-faceted treatment
    and supervision plan, including the on-going administration of Lupron
    injections.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge considered all the expert evidence and, as he was
    entitled to do, rejected the defence expert’s opinion on the prospects of
    managing the appellant’s risk in the community.  He concluded, for example,
    that this expert’s view of the appellant’s potential reconditioning and
    possible discontinued use of Lupron was unrealistic.  This conclusion is
    reasonably supported by this record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken as a whole, the appellant’s complaints regarding his designation
    as a dangerous offender are focused on the sentencing judge’s assessment of the
    evidence and related factual findings, both of which are squarely within the
    sentencing judge’s domain and attract considerable deference from this court. 
    In effect, the appellant seeks to have this court revisit the sentencing
    judge’s key factual findings, although they are grounded in the evidence.  That
    is not the function of this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other main ground of appeal concerns the admission of expert
    psychiatric reply evidence regarding the significance (or lack thereof) of
    phallometric testing of the appellant.  The appellant argues that this evidence
    was inadmissible and that the sentencing judge improperly relied on it in
    concluding that there was no reasonable possibility of eventual control of the
    appellant’s risk in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The impugned evidence and a will-say statement of the
    reply expert’s proposed testimony were admitted on consent.  In these
    circumstances, there can be no sustainable objection to the admission of the
    evidence.  Nor do we accept that the sentencing judge misused this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from sentence is dismissed.</p>
