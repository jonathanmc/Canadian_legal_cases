  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction on two interrelated grounds.  The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider the violation of the
    his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> right to counsel when considering whether his s. 8
    right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was violated when he gave
    a DNA sample.  The appellant further submits that the breach of his s. 10(b)
    right to counsel in connection with the giving of his statement tainted his
    consent to give a DNA sample.  The appellant submits that the DNA sample should
    also have been excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  Although the trial judge did not specifically consider the
    s. 10(b) violation in the context of s. 8, she did consider it when considering
    whether the DNA sample should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2).  Implicit in
    this consideration was what the result should be on the assumption that the appellants
    s. 8 right had been violated.  We would dismiss the first ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to the second ground of appeal, there was a close temporal
    and contextual connection to the taking of the appellants statement in
    violation of s. 10(b), but the appellants signed waiver and consent to give
    the DNA sample was obtained only after the reiteration of his right to counsel
    and the consequences of giving the sample had been made clear to him.  It broke
    the connection between the s. 10(b) non-compliance with respect to the taking
    of his statement and the giving of the DNA sample.  This case is
    indistinguishable from this courts decision in <i>R v. Simon</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
