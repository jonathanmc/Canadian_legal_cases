style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, a lawyer, moves for a stay of an order finding him in
    contempt of court. The contempt finding arises from a <i>Mareva</i> injunction
    (“the order”) obtained by the respondent against the appellant’s client. After
    the order freezing the client’s assets on strict terms had been made, the
    appellant received a cheque from his client for a very substantial sum. The
    appellant deposited the cheque in his trust account. He deducted his
    outstanding fees and, because he believed that following his client’s
    instructions to use the remainder to settle some debts would violate the order,
    he instead returned the balance to the client. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the appellant’s conduct constituted contempt
    of the order which, <i>inter alia</i>, ordered any person with knowledge of the
    order to prevent the withdrawal of monies held in the client’s name in a trust
    account. The appellant seeks to reverse that finding, essentially on the grounds
    that the motion judge erred in her interpretation of the order and that the
    order was not sufficiently clear to forbid the course of action he took.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon giving her reasons for finding the appellant in contempt, the
    motion judge adjourned the matter pursuant to rule 60.11 (1), (5) and (8):</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge explained what she was doing as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a result, the parties
    shall appear before me for a hearing during the week of December 19, 2011 at
    361 University Avenue. Mr. Carey’s attendance is required at the hearing
    although he is not obliged to call any evidence or testify. At that hearing, if
    he wishes, Mr. Carey shall have the opportunity to present any further
    evidence, including <i>viva voce</i> evidence, and make any submissions that he
    wishes to make. The plaintiff shall also have the opportunity to file any
    further material, call evidence, cross-examine at the hearing, and make
    submissions. I shall take all of this into account in making any order under rule
    60.11(5) and (8) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that it would be appropriate for this court to
    stay the proceedings at this stage and to entertain his appeal from the
    contempt finding before allowing the motion judge to make her final disposition
    pursuant to rule 60.11(5).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I am unable to accept the appellant’s
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, it would be premature to grant a stay at this point
    in the contempt proceedings. A stay would interrupt the Superior Court proceedings
    and run a serious risk of fragmenting any appeals to this court. If the appeal
    from the contempt finding were to succeed, that would end the matter, but if it
    failed, the appellant would still have a right of appeal from any sanction the
    motion judge imposed. Appeals that interrupt a proceeding and risk a fragmented
    appeal are almost invariably discouraged. It is almost always preferable and
    more efficient for appeals to await the completion of proceedings in the trial
    court so that a complete record and disposition is presented on appeal: see,
    e.g. <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Laudon&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Roberts</span></i><span
style='line-height:200%'>,&nbsp;2009 ONCA 383, 308 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 422,
    at para. 25: “</span><span lang=EN>The time-honoured practice of reserving to
    the conclusion of trial the appeal of various rulings made during the
    proceedings is sound in that it preserves court time and costs.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant cites <i>Bell ExpressVu Ltd. Partnership v. Torroni,</i> 2009 ONCA 85, 304 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 431, as a case where this court
    appears to have entertained an appeal from a finding of contempt before the
    sanction was imposed: see para. 19. However, as I read that case, the court
    entertained the appeal without any consideration of the point at issue here.
    Accordingly, I do not view <i>Bell ExpressVu</i> as authority to depart from
    the established rule against hearing appeals on a piecemeal basis or as
    authority for the proposition that appeals from contempt findings should
    ordinarily be heard before the sanction has been imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To stay the contempt proceedings at this stage would also interfere with
    the design of the commonly followed procedure that is permitted, if not
    prescribed, by rule 60.11 (5) and (8), of dividing a contempt proceeding into
    two phases, the first dealing with the issue of whether the party is in contempt
    and the second dealing with the issue of sanction. Until the order has been
    made under 60.11 (5), the contempt proceedings have not come to their final
    conclusion. Until the sanction has been imposed, the judge has not expressed
    his or her final view of the case. It is clear from the passage quoted above
    from the motion judge’s reasons that she has not yet completed her adjudication
    of the contempt proceedings. Indeed, her specific reference to rule 60.11 (8)
    indicates that she remains open to a wide range of possible outcomes. Until she
    completes her work, this court will not know if the motion judge considered the
    contempt to be serious or trivial or how the judge intended to use the sanction
    of contempt to bring about compliance or to punish the contemnor. These are
    elements integral to the nature and character of the contempt proceeding and
    essential to an appellate court’s full appreciation of the disposition under
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, even if I were to approach the matter solely from the
    perspective of applying the test for a stay, it is my view that the appellant’s
    request for a would stay fail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will assume for these purposes that the appellant can satisfy the
    first branch of the test and show that there is, as required by the <i>RJR
    MacDonald Inc. v. Canada</i> [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 test, a serious issue for this
    court to decide, or, in the words of Finlayson J.A. in <i>Vassallo v. Mulberry
    Street Ltd.</i> (1995), 83 O.A.C. 386 at para. 15, that the merits of the
    appeal “deserve the attention of the full court”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant cannot, however, demonstrate either irreparable harm or
    that at this stage, the balance of convenience favours a stay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until the motion judge makes her order under rule 60.11 (5), we do not
    know what harm the appellant will suffer as a result of the finding of contempt
    and so we cannot say that the harm is irreparable. I do not accept the
    appellant’s submission that the mere risk that he will be sent to jail is
    sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm. Indeed, the respondent has stated
    that she will not seek immediate committal at the sentencing hearing. If, at
    some point, the sanction of imprisonment is imposed, the appellant can move
    immediately for a stay and the court can then assess the merits of the stay
    application with a complete picture of the peril he faces. This would follow
    the practice used in criminal appeals where an appellant cannot seek judicial
    interim release until the appeal from conviction is heard until sentence has
    been imposed Furthermore, the appellant will almost certainly have an advantage
    over most criminal appellants as it is very unlikely that in a civil contempt
    proceeding he will be taken immediately to jail without the opportunity to seek
    a stay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor, in my view, can the appellant show that the balance of interest
    favours granting a stay at this point in the proceedings. The balance of
    convenience can only be assessed in the light of the sanction the appellant
    seeks to avoid on appeal. And, as I have explained, the interests of justice
    strongly favour postponing the stay decision until after the motion judge has
    decided upon the appropriate sanction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the motion for a stay is dismissed with costs to the
    respondent fixed at $3,000 inclusive of disbursements and HST.</p>
