    Minister’s order, the contentious issue is whether a single judge of this court
    also has jurisdiction to appoint counsel for a judicial review.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court of appeal or a judge

    who is a party to an appeal or to proceedings preliminary or incidental to an
    appeal where, in the opinion of the court or judge, it appears desirable in the
    interests of justice that the accused should have legal assistance and where it

    1999, c. 18, s. 52, expressly incorporates s. 684 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in relation to “appeals under this Act.” An application for judicial review
    from the Minister’s surrender order pursuant to s. 57 of the <i>Extradition Act</i> is a proceeding distinct from an appeal from the committal order pursuant to s.
    49. There is no provision comparable to s. 52 that expressly incorporates s.
    684 in relation to applications for judicial review. </span></p>

    absent express statutory authority, the only possible source of jurisdiction to
    appoint counsel in relation to the judicial review application is this court’s
    ancillary jurisdiction to make orders to control its own process. <i>R. v. Russel,</i> 2011 ONCA 303, 270 C.C.C. (3d) 256, at paras. 40-43 holds that a statutory
    trial court has the authority to appoint <i>amicus</i> where such an order is
    “necessary for the court to properly exercise the jurisdiction conferred by statute”.
    The Attorney General concedes that it therefore must follow that this court
    also has that jurisdiction. However, the Attorney General further submits that
    as the power is that of the “court”, it must be exercised by a panel of three
    judges and that a single judge sitting in chambers has no such authority: <i>R.
    v. Church of Scientology of Toronto </i>(1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>

    appoint counsel where necessary, but requires the additional time-consuming
    step of an application to a three judge panel, rather than allowing the matter
    to proceed more efficiently and expeditiously before a single judge in
    chambers. </span></p>

    the jurisdiction of a single judge. In <i>United States of America v. Peay,</i> [1996] O.J. No. 1688 (Ont. C.A. [In Chambers]), Moldaver J.A. assumed, without
    deciding, that he had jurisdiction to appoint counsel in a case like the
    present, but declined to do so. Other cases have considered the merits of
    appointing of counsel for an application for judicial review without raising or
    dealing with the jurisdictional issue: see <i>United States of America v.
    Wilson, </i>2011 BCCA 96, B.C.W.L.D. 2601 [In Chambers]; aff’d 2011 BCCA 164,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If an appeal under section 49 or any other appeal
    in respect of a matter arising under this Act is pending, the court of appeal
    may join the hearing of that appeal with the hearing of an application for
    judicial review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>Here, the hearing of the application
    for judicial review has been joined with the hearing of the s. 49 appeal. I see
    no reason why I should not regard the two proceedings as joined for the
    purposes of the preliminary and incidental procedural issue of appointment of
    counsel pursuant to s. 684. I note that s. 684 allows for the appointment of
    counsel in relation “to proceedings preliminary or incidental to an appeal”. </span></p>

    issue that the applicant lacks the means to obtain legal assistance and the

style='line-height:200%'>20-21, directs an inquiry whether the applicant
    requires the assistance of counsel to be “afforded a meaningful opportunity to
    establish the merits of the grounds” advanced.  That question falls to be
    assessed on the basis of “two closely related principles”:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, counsel must be appointed where an accused
    cannot effectively present his or her appeal without the help of a lawyer.
    Second, counsel must be appointed where the court cannot properly decide the
    appeal without the assistance of counsel. In most situations, both or neither
    principle will operate to require the appointment of counsel. Sometimes,
    however, one or the other, standing alone, will justify the appointment of a
    lawyer for the appellant.</p>

    explained why the Canadian criminal investigation had no impact on, and caused
    no prejudice with respect to, the extradition proceedings. The Minister also
    explained that matters of defence were for trial in the requesting state and
    that differences in substantive law do not constitute a reason to refuse
    surrender. The nature of the fraud in the amount of the loss were, according to
    the Minister, matters for the extradition judge in assessing the sufficiency of
    the evidence warranted committal, not matters for the Minister. The fact that a
    person sought for extradition faces a harsher sentence in the requesting state
    does not automatically make surrender unfair or oppressive.</span></p>

    the minimal “arguable” threshold test on the merits, I am not persuaded that he
    satisfies the second step, set out in <i>Bernardo</i>, at para. 21:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…can the appellant effectively advance his grounds
    of appeal without the assistance of counsel? This inquiry looks to the
    complexities of the arguments to be advanced and the appellant’s ability to
    make an oral argument in support of the grounds of appeal. The complexity of
    the argument is a product of the grounds of appeal, the length and content of
    the record on appeal, the legal principles engaged, and the application of
    those principles to the facts of the case. An appellant’s ability to make
    arguments in support of his or her grounds of appeal turns on a number of
    factors, including the appellant’s ability to understand the written word,
    comprehend the applicable legal principles, relate those principles to the
    facts of the case, and articulate the end product of that process before the
    court.</p>

    this court involve a level of complexity that a lay person would find difficult
    to navigate, this appeal will be heard as an inmate appeal where the appellant
    will have the assistance of duty counsel. Counsel for the applicant outlined
    for me the arguments to be advanced on the appeal from the committal order and
    on the application for judicial review. The panel hearing the appeal will have
    the benefit of the applicant’s written submissions to the Minister of Justice
    which set out, in some detail, the applicant’s position. This is not a case,
    like <i>Bernardo</i>, involving a voluminous record yet to be compiled. Nor
    does it involve legal issues that will be unfamiliar to either the panel
    hearing the appeal or to duty counsel. In my view, particularly with the added
    benefit of duty counsel, this case falls into the same category as <i>United
    States v. Peay </i>where Moldaver observed, at para. 3, </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am confident that if the panel hearing the appeal
    and the application for judicial review is provided with this material, as well
    as the additional material in the appeal book, the applicant should have little
    difficulty presenting his own case with full assurance that the court will have
    a firm grasp of the issues raised and the arguments for and against.</p>
