  <p class=Paragraph1><strong>(2)</strong>            In proceedings in respect
    of the offences referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b), the presiding judge or
    justice shall</p>

    information that could identify a victim, witness or justice system participant
    whose identity is protected by the order. 2005, c. 32, s. 15.</p>

    the appellants conviction of sexual assault can survive because his exclusions
    from the proceedings were procedural irregularities under s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> that caused him no prejudice.  I have concluded that
    s. 686(1)(b)(iv) cannot save the appellants conviction.  These reasons explain
    why I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial on the
    charge of sexual assault.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant alleged a single incident of
    sexual assault that started out with a backrub, progressed to touching of her
    breasts, continued with digital penetration of her vagina and concluded with
    preparations by the appellant for vaginal intercourse that were interrupted by
    a knock on the front door of the appellants home.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principals</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, a 51-year-old long-distance
    trucker, lived in his own home with his two sons and the girlfriend of one of
    his sons.  In early 2007, the appellants eldest son asked whether he, the
    mother of his child, the child and the complainant could move into the
    appellants home temporarily. The appellant agreed and moved out of his own house
    to live at the home of his friend, Ricco, in the same city.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant slept on a pull-out mattress in
    the living room at the appellants home.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Offence Alleged</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant woke up around 11:00 a.m. on
    March 23, 2007. The appellant was sitting on the sofa at the foot of her bed
    watching television. When the complainant returned from the bathroom, the
    appellant asked her whether she wanted a massage. The complainant declined the
    offer and went back to sleep.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant awakened a second time. The
    appellant was rubbing her back.  She told him to stop and rolled over on her
    back. The appellant then climbed on top of her. He held her down with his chest.
    Over her protests and physical resistance, he put his hand up her shirt and
    felt her breasts over her bra. The appellant then slid his hand down the
    complainants pants, inserted his fingers in her vagina, pried her legs open
    and started to unbutton his pants. The appellant stopped when someone knocked
    at the front door.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly after the alleged incident, the complainant
    disclosed her allegations to others.  She and the others, who had recently
    moved into the appellants home, moved out.  </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Position of the Defence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified in his own defence.  He denied
    the complainants allegations. He advanced an alibi. At first, the appellant
    claimed that he was out of the country on March 23, 2007. Later, he admitted that
    he was in the city where the offence occurred, Brantford, on March 23, 2007,
    but claimed that he did not go to his house that day. He divided his time
    between moving trailers for his employer and resting at Riccos place.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also called several witnesses who
    testified about his good reputation in the local Spanish-speaking community.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant advances several grounds of appeal,
    which I would consolidate and paraphrase as these allegations of error:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>                        i.          excluding
    the appellant from the courtroom at the request of the prosecutor during cross-examination and from the pre-charge conference;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>                        ii.         failing to curtail the prosecutors cross-examination of the appellant when it strayed into impermissible subjects like propensity and access to disclosure; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>                        iii.       failing to properly instruct the jury on the relationship between reasonable doubt, alibi and the other defence evidence, and about the adverse inference associated with the late disclosure of the appellants alibi.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Ground #1: Exclusions of the Appellant During Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A brief description of the circumstances in
    which each exclusion occurred is essential to an understanding of this ground
    of appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Exclusion During
    Cross-examination</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During cross-examination, the prosecutor sought
    to put a MapQuest document to the appellant to challenge his testimony about
    the distances the appellant said he travelled while making some deliveries in
    Brantford on March 23, 2007. In the presence of the jury, the trial judge asked
    about the relevance of the evidence to be elicited by the proposed
    cross-examination. The prosecutor asked that the jury be excluded for the
    discussion.  The judge sent the jury to the jury room.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the jury had retired, the trial judge
    asked the prosecutor whether he wanted the witness excluded during the
    discussion. The prosecutor confirmed that the witness should be excluded. The
    trial judge ordered the appellant to step into the hallway while the discussion
    took place. The appellant complied. The appellants counsel said nothing.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the appellants absence, the trial judge told
    the prosecutor that he had not yet laid the groundwork for the proposed
    cross-examination. When the trial judge directed the appellants return to the
    courtroom, the appellants counsel (not counsel on appeal) raised a disclosure
    issue: the prosecutor had not previously disclosed some cell phone records that
    had been made a trial exhibit a few minutes earlier. The appellant remained
    outside the courtroom. The trial judge permitted trial counsel to speak to the
    appellant about a specific telephone number that appeared in the records, even
    though the appellant was under cross-examination at the time.  The appellant then
    returned to the courtroom.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants exclusion during
    cross-examination lasted for nine minutes.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Exclusion from the
    Pre-charge Conference</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After counsel had finished their closing addresses
    to the jury, the trial judge summoned them to his chambers to discuss his final
    instructions to the jury. The entire pre-charge conference took place in the
    judges chambers.  The appellant was absent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the trial resumed the following day, neither
    counsel said anything about the pre-charge conference or the appellants
    absence from it.  The trial judge provided the jury with a written copy of his
    charge and a decision tree for their assistance during their deliberations.  Neither
    counsel objected to the content of the charge to the jury.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties on
    Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties agree that the appellants
    exclusions during cross-examination and from the pre-charge conference
    contravened s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  They disagree about the
    availability of the procedural proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) to save the verdict
    from reversal on this ground.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the appellant, Mr. Aly reminds us of the
    bedrock principles that underlie an accuseds right to be present during the
    whole of the trial. The right to be present ensures that an accused hears the
    case advanced by the prosecutor, and acquires firsthand knowledge of it as an
    ear and eye witness during its unfolding.  The requirement that the accused be
    present ensures the appearance of fairness of the criminal trial process.  </span></p>

    cross-examination had no effect on the evidentiary landscape of the appellants
    trial, caused no actual prejudice and did not impair the fairness of the trial.
    The initial discussion about MapQuest occurred before the exclusion. The
    appellant agreed with the facts the prosecutor sought to establish by use of
    the MapQuest document, both before and after the exclusion.  In other words,
    the exclusion changed nothing. Further, the appellants own counsel initiated
    the discussion, in the appellants absence, about late disclosure of the Bell
    Security records. The trial judge permitted counsel to discuss these records
    with the appellant, even though the appellant was under cross-examination.
    Defence counsel raised no objection to the exclusion when it began and extended
    it when he raised his complaint about late disclosure.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In connection with the appellants exclusion
    from the pre-charge conference, Mr. Tweney repeats that defence counsel was
    present throughout the discussion and did not object to the venue or to his
    clients absence from the conference.  He argues that we cannot assume
    prejudice without evidence of what actually occurred, especially where trial
    counsel did not object to the charge that was provided to the jurors in writing.
    Nothing that occurred altered the course of the trial, or the defence conduct
    of it, because the evidence and final addresses had already been completed.</span></p>

    required to decide whether the proviso of s. 686(1)(b)(iv) can be invoked to preserve
    the finding of guilt made by the jury at trial.</span></p>

    that any error or irregularity to which the proviso may apply must be one that
    is procedural, rather than substantive in nature, albeit an irregularity
    sufficiently serious that it can be characterized as fundamental in nature and
    results in a loss of jurisdiction: <i>R. v. Cloutier</i> (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d)
    35 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 48.  See also, <i>R. v. Joinson</i> (1986), 32 C.C.C.
    (3d) 542 (B.C. C.A.), at pp. 547-548.  Among the procedural irregularities to
    which s. 686(1)(b)(iv) can apply is a breach of s.&nbsp;650(1) by exclusion of
    an accused from a part of his or her trial: <i>Cloutier</i>, at p. 49; <i>R. v.

    jurisdiction to try any indictable offence under s. 468 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.

    sense of prejudice to the appearance of the due administration of justice: <i>R.

    procedural error of the nature described in the subparagraph creates an
    inference of prejudice without requiring the appellant to establish specific prejudice
    in every case. This inference of prejudice is rebuttable: <i>R. v. Khan</i>,
    [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 16. The test of prejudice under s. 686(1)(b)(iv)
    is the same as the no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice standard in

    clear that, although an appellant need not show that she or he has suffered
    actual prejudice in order to exclude the application of the proviso, if the

    procedural irregularity, the court of appeal may dismiss the appeal: <i>Cloutier</i>,

    procedural error, it is the opinion of the court of appeal that prevails, not
    the perception of the appellant that she or he has suffered prejudice: <i>Cloutier</i>,

    circumstances, including but not only the factors listed in <i>Simon</i> at

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The determination of this ground of appeal
    requires us to decide whether the exclusions, alone or together, prejudiced the
    appellant or impaired the appearance of the due administration of justice to
    such an extent that the jurys verdict cannot stand.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Consider first the exclusion of the appellant
    during part of his cross-examination by the prosecutor at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When issues arise about the propriety of an
    actual or proposed line of cross-examination of a witness in the witness box,
    it is commonplace for one or both parties to ask and the trial judge to direct
    the jury and witness to retire while submissions and a ruling are made on the
    dispute. For the ordinary witness, exclusions do not amount to a procedural
    irregularity. But an accused who testifies on his or her own behalf is not an
    ordinary witness. An accused who takes up the mantle of a witness remains an accused
    whose presence for the whole of the trial is required by s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  Despite the concurrence of counsel about a witness exclusion, trial
    judges must remain vigilant to ensure that the witness they are excluding is
    not an accused.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants exclusion during
    cross-examination began when the prosecutor responded to the trial judges
    query about whether the witness should be excluded during the discussion.  As I
    have said, trial counsel for the appellant said nothing.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue raised by the prosecutor that formed
    the basis for the appellants exclusion was settled quickly. When the trial
    judge directed that the appellant return to the courtroom, trial counsel for
    the appellant raised an issue about delayed disclosure of some Bell Security
    records. Counsel discussed the issue and the trial judge ruled on it in the
    appellants absence. The ruling permitted defence counsel to discuss the
    subject with the appellant even though the appellant was in the midst of
    cross-examination.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This exclusion lasted nine minutes. Defence
    counsel was present throughout and made submissions on the appellants behalf. Most
    of the time during the appellants absence was taken up in the discussion of an
    issue raised by defence counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Defence counsel did not object to the
    appellants exclusion.  His submissions on both issues discussed in the
    appellants absence were not affected by the exclusion.  None of the
    discussions had any effect on the conduct of the appellants defence or
    impaired its advancement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What happened here was that the intentional and
    understandable exclusion of a witness resulted in the exclusion of the appellant
    and a breach of s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This should not have
    occurred.  An accused has the right to be present throughout the entirety of
    his or her trial, including during discussions pertaining to
    cross-examination.  Nonetheless, in the circumstances of this case as I have
    described them, if this nine-minute exclusion stood alone, I would apply
    s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iv) to the procedural irregularity and preserve the finding
    of guilt on the ground that the appellant suffered no prejudice from it.</span></p>

    connection with the second exclusion: the result of the trial judges decision
    to conduct the entire pre-charge conference in chambers rather than in open
    court, on the record, in the presence of the appellant and in the absence of
    the jury.</span></p>

    discussed; nothing about the submissions made; and nothing about any agreements
    that may have been reached. We can infer, from what occurred later, that, in
    the end, counsel were satisfied with the contents of the charge: neither
    objected to it.  Perhaps the trial judge provided a draft of his proposed
    charge to counsel, as many judges do, to focus the pre-charge discussion. But
    of that, on this record, we cannot be certain. Unlike in <i>Simon</i>, where an
    affidavit from trial counsel furnished some information about what happened in
    chambers, the cupboard here is bare. Unlike in <i>Simon</i>, where the
    pre-hearing conference conducted in chambers was preliminary and followed by a
    full discussion in open court in the presence of the accused, the entire
    conference in this case took place in chambers in the appellants absence.</span></p>

    pre-charge conference in chambers. He directed counsel to attend at a specified
    time. Neither counsel objected. The announced purpose of the conference was to
    discuss the contents of the judges charge, the only segment of the trial that
    remained to be completed before the jury retired to decide the case. When
    proceedings recommenced the following morning, no one said anything about what
    happened during the pre-charge conference.  No one filed as lettered exhibits,
    any draft instructions that may have been provided to counsel for discussion
    there. </span></p>

    closing addresses of counsel.  With the evidence and addresses complete, whatever
    happened at the pre-charge conference in the appellants absence could not have
    affected the conduct of the defence. Some might also query whether the presence
    of an accused would have any meaningful impact on the submissions made by
    defence counsel at the conference. But s. 650(2) makes no pre-charge conference
    exception to the general requirement that an accused be present during the
    whole of his or her trial.</span></p>

    prejudice is not a condition precedent to demonstration of a miscarriage of
    justice. An appearance of unfairness will suffice: <i>R. v. Hertrich </i>(1982),

    some instructions are included and others are omitted from the charge  firsthand;

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not order a new trial on this ground
    despite the impropriety of the cross-examination of the appellant on whether he
    considered the complainant attractive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellants police interview was
    played for the jury. The DVD and a transcript were filed as exhibits.  During
    the interview, the appellant denied any improper conduct with the complainant.
    Among other things, the appellant made it clear that he considered the
    complainant promiscuous and unworthy of belief. Further, he suggested that he
    would not have committed the offence because he was a married man. The
    prosecutor was entitled to cross-examine the appellant on what he said when
    interviewed by the police and to demonstrate the falsity of some of the remarks
    the appellant made during that interview.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The brief reference to the appellants access to
    disclosure arose in connection with the appellants notices of alibi. The
    cross-examination did not suggest, directly or by implication, that the
    appellants evidence was less worthy of belief because he had received full
    disclosure of the prosecutors case in advance of trial. The prosecutor was
    entitled to show through cross-examination that the alibi notices were given
    after the appellant was made aware of the complainants allegations, including
    when and where she said that the assault occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, trial counsel for the appellant did not
    object to any of the cross-examination about which complaint is now made.
    Although failure to object cannot convert the improper into the acceptable, the
    lack of complaint affords some indication that trial counsel did not consider
    the cross-examination unfair or prejudicial.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the impugned parts of the
    cross-examination were brief, not lengthy, repetitive or protracted as
    sometimes occurs. In other words, this is not a case like <i>R. v. Logiaco</i> (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 374 (Ont. C.A.) where the cross-examination was
    persistent, abusive, demeaning, likely to distract the jurors from their task
    and apt to contribute to a manifest appearance of unfairness.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We should also recall that this
    cross-examination took place during a trial in which the appellant put his
    character in issue: he said that he was simply not the type of person who would
    have sexual contact with a young person like the complainant. The prosecutor
    was entitled to test the veracity of this claim in cross-examination of the
    appellant.</span></p>

    allegations. He said he wasnt at the house when the offence occurred. Besides,
    he wasnt the kind of person to sexually assault teenaged girls. He testified

    sent an alibi notice to the Crown Attorney. This notice indicated that the
    appellant had left Canada on March 22, 2007, to travel to the United States
    where he was to deliver a load of flower pots. According to various receipts,
    he purchased fuel in the United States from March 23 to March 28, 2007.  At

    delivered them to a Florida customer on March 26, 2007.  But the appellants
    daily logs suggested that he was off-duty on March 22, 2007, that he worked in
    Brantford from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to noon on March 23, that he left for Florida on
    March 24 and that he arrived there on March&nbsp;25.</span></p>

    to the Crown Attorney that, after a review of his records, the appellant recalled
    that he was supposed to leave for Florida on March 23 but he was sick that
    day.  He remained in Brantford that day and moved a couple of trailers before
    he returned to his friend Riccos place for the rest of the day.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his evidence at trial, the appellant testified
    that he slept at Riccos house on the night of March 22nd. When he woke up on
    March 23rd, the appellant felt ill. Instead of driving to Florida, he did some
    deliveries around Brantford between 10:30 a.m. and 12:15&nbsp;p.m.  He returned
    to Riccos house for the rest of the day. He also tendered his cell phone
    records that showed a 23-minute call starting at 10:57 a.m. and no calls
    between 11:20 and 11:51 a.m.</span></p>

    appellants behalf, including his employer and Ricco.  His employer confirmed
    that the appellant got to work between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. on March 23rd and
    moved some trailers. The employer could not say where the appellant went or
    what he did between loads. Ricco said the appellant was away from his home
    between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. on March 23rd. </span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Jury Instructions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his final instructions to the jury, the trial
    judge repeated twice the formula suggested by Cory J. in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  In an early part of the charge, the trial judge referred to
    evidence favouring [the appellant] when he discussed the onus of proof. He
    emphasized that the jury were not permitted to decide the case simply by
    choosing the evidence favouring one side as opposed to the other.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge approached the positions of the
    parties by reminding jurors that they were not to make their decision on the
    basis of whom they found more credible, the complainant or the appellant. He
    pointed out that the appellants position was that the events alleged by the
    complainant did not occur: the appellant was not at his house when the assault
    occurred, if an assault actually happened. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also included an instruction
    about the use the jurors could make of the evidence of good character. He
    instructed the jurors that the evidence of good character may make it less
    likely that the appellant committed the offence and could itself create a
    reasonable doubt about his guilt. He also reminded the jurors that evidence of
    good character may make the appellants testimony more worthy of belief. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neither counsel objected to the trial judges

    discrete, yet related, errors that he says had the effect of failing to put the
    defence position fairly and correctly before the jury.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, Mr. Aly submits, the trial judge failed
    to tell the jury that, apart from the appellants testimony and the evidence of
    good character, the remainder of the evidence adduced on his behalf could
    itself raise a reasonable doubt about his presence at his house on March 23<sup>rd</sup>,
    and thus his commission of the offence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, Mr. Aly contends, the trial judge
    failed to link his instructions on reasonable doubt, especially the <i>W. (D.)</i> formula, to the alibi evidence adduced by the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And finally, the judge also neglected to point
    out that the jurors could draw no inference adverse to the appellant because he
    lagged in providing his alibi to the police. The disclosure left plenty of time
    for investigation and that is all that counts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Tweney, for the respondent, resists the

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Tweney says that, taken as a whole, the
    instructions made it clear, and the jury would have understood, that they were
    to make their decision on the basis of the evidence as a whole, that the burden
    of proof was on the Crown and that the appellant was required to prove nothing.
    The trial judge repeated twice the formula recommended in <i>W. (D.)</i>. He
    made it clear to the jury that they were not to decide the case simply by
    comparing the competing versions of events of the principals and returning a
    verdict based on their preference. And the position of the defence was left to
    the jury in a way that attracted no objection from trial counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Tweney points out that no particular formula
    is prescribed for an instruction on an alibi. To be more specific, he says that
    the trial judge did not have to relate the defence of alibi to the instruction
    on reasonable doubt because the instructions as a whole made the point clear. Further,
    the trial judge was under no obligation to instruct the jury, expressly, that
    they could draw no adverse inference from the delay in disclosure of the
    appellants alibi.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In a jury trial in which credibility is an essential or a central
    issue, the trial judge must explain to the jury the relationship between their
    assessment of credibility and the burden and standard of proof they are to
    apply in making their decision. The word formula suggested by Cory J. in <i>W.
    (D.)</i> is one way to convey what the law requires: <i>W. (D.)</i>, at pp.
    757-758.  But the <i>W. (D.)</i> formula is not the only way, as if some magic
    incantation: <i>R. v. S. (W.D.)</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, at p. 533; <i>R. v.
    S. (J.H.)</i>, 2008 SCC 30, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para. 13.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>What must be made clear to the jury in the final instructions as a
    whole is that the burden of proof is borne by and never shifts from the Crown
    to prove each and every essential element of the offence beyond a reasonable
    doubt. Substance prevails, not the word formula used.  In the end, what counts
    is whether, from what the judge said, the jury could not have been under any
    misapprehension about the correct burden and standard of proof to apply: <i>W.
    (D.)</i>, at p. 758; <i>S. (J.H.)</i>, at para. 14; <i>R. v. Y. (C.L.)</i>,
    2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 7.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The principles that underlie <i>W. (D.)</i> are not restricted to
    cases where an accused testifies and where his or her evidence conflicts with
    evidence of witnesses for the prosecution. Where, on a vital issue, credibility
    findings must be made between conflicting evidence called by the defence or
    emerging from evidence favourable to the defence adduced as part of the Crowns
    case, the trial judge must relate the principle of reasonable doubt to those
    credibility findings: <i>R. v. D. (B.)</i>, 2011 ONCA 51, 266 C.C.C. (3d) 197,
    at para. 114. What the jury must understand is that to find an accused not
    guilty, they need not believe the defence evidence on the vital issue; rather,
    it is enough that the conflicting evidence leaves them with a reasonable doubt
    about the accuseds guilt in light of all the evidence: <i>D. (B.)</i>, at
    para. 114.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Where alibi evidence is adduced, the principles underlying <i>W.
    (D.) </i>are engaged, but it is  not always necessary to expressly insert the <i>W.
    (D.) </i>formula in a discrete alibi instruction: <i>R. v. Harriott</i> (2002),
    58 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at paras. 17-21.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In instructing a jury on the defence of alibi, a trial judge may
    point out that a failure to disclose an alibi in sufficient time to permit its
    investigation by police is a factor that the jury may take into account in
    assessing the weight they will attribute to the alibi evidence: <i>R. v.
    Russell</i>, <i>R. v. Dunbar</i> (1936), 66 C.C.C. 306 (B.C. C.A.), at p. 322,

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This was not a complex case.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant alleged that she was sexually
    assaulted at the appellants home shortly before noon on March 23, 2007. She
    said that the person who sexually assaulted her was the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant denied that he sexually assaulted
    the complainant.  In support of his denial he relied upon: </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>i.          his testimony that he was elsewhere in Brantford at the time the offence allegedly occurred;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>ii.         the testimony of other family members and residents of his home that he was not at home at the relevant time;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iii.       evidence from witnesses about his good character and favourable reputation in the local Spanish-speaking community; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>iv.        a submission that the complainant was unworthy of belief.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge charged the jury twice in
    accordance with the regime suggested by Cory J. in <i>W. (D.)</i>.  In addition,
    the trial judge referred to the evidence favouring the accused in his instruction
    on the burden of proof. Such a description reasonably embraces all the evidence
    supportive of the defence position, including the appellants alibi, the
    testimony of other family members and the evidence of good character. The <i>W.
    (D.) </i>instructions were admittedly less expansive, but I am not persuaded
    that the language used would have confused the jury or left them with the
    impression that the instruction applied only to the appellants testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, when read as a whole, the instructions
    leave no doubt about the correct burden and standard of proof that the jurors
    were to apply in making their decision.  The instructions emphasize that the
    jurors were not to decide the case by simply comparing the competing versions
    of events, and resolving the conflict in favour of their preference. They were
    reminded at different places in the charge that the burden of proof was settled
    upon the Crown and never shifted. The jurors also had a written copy of the
    charge to help them during their deliberations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition, the trial judge gave a specific, perhaps
    overly favourable, instruction to the jury about the use they could make of the
    evidence of good character to conclude that commission of the offence by the
    appellant was unlikely and to enhance the appellants credibility as a witness
    at trial.  He made  no mention, for example, of the common sense observation
    that the propensity value of character evidence as to morality may be of
    diminished weight in prosecutions for alleged sexual offences against young
    persons:  <i>R. v. Profit</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 637, at pp. 637-638.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neither Crown counsel nor the trial judge said
    anything about the evidentiary significance of the timing of the alibi notices.
     Since nothing of evidentiary significance was suggested as a result of the
    delay, in delivery of the first notice, the trial judge was under no obligation
    to instruct the jury that the timing of the alibi notices was of no evidentiary
    import.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is of no little significance that trial

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal on
    the ground that the entire pre-charge conference was conducted in the
    appellants absence, set aside the conviction and order a new trial on the
    charge contained in the indictment.</span></p>
