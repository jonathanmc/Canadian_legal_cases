  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In 2006, the Intelligence Services
    Branch of the Niagara Regional Police Service (the “NRPS”) learned that the
    Hell’s Angels motorcycle gang had possession of a confidential police
    document.  The ensuing investigation (the “Leak Investigation”) disclosed that
    the document had originated from the Port Colborne detachment of the NRPS,
    where the respondent, Dean Rudge, was then a serving officer.  The
    investigators obtained information that caused them to suspect Rudge as the
    source of the leak.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Concurrent with the Leak
    Investigation, the province’s Biker Enforcement Unit (“BEU”) was running a multi-force
    investigation (“Project Tandem”) targeting the Ontario Hell’s Angels.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On September 28, 2006, as part of Project
    Tandem, the police executed search warrants at various locations connected to
    the Hell’s Angels and seized additional documents that could be linked to Rudge.
       </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On April 4, 2007, Rudge was
    arrested and charged with breach of trust by a public official contrary to s.
    122 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.   The police obtained a production order for
    Rudge’s cell phone records.  These records showed a series of conversations
    between Rudge and Sandra Taylor, the common-law spouse of Ken Wagner, the
    president of the Niagara chapter of the Hell’s Angels.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the ensuing 11-day judge-alone
    trial, the Crown presented substantial circumstantial evidence to show that
    Rudge, in connection with his duties as a police officer, had provided
    confidential police documents to a criminal organization, thereby betraying the
    trust reposed in him by the public as a police officer.  This evidence fell
    into two categories – the seized documents and their connection with Rudge and records
    of phone calls between Rudge and Sandra Taylor. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Rudge denied the allegations
    against him and adduced evidence in response to the inferences the Crown argued
    should be drawn from the combined effect of the documents and the cell phone
    records. With respect to the leaked documents, Rudge called evidence concerning
    certain weaknesses in the Port Colborne police detachment’s building’s security
    system.  This was to support his theory that the documents had been obtained by
    the Hell’s Angels from an unknown person who had broken into (or otherwise
    gained access to) the building, had taken them and had provided them to the
    Hell’s Angels. With respect to the cell phone calls, Rudge offered evidence in
    support of an innocent explanation – that they were related to his efforts to
    assist Sandra Taylor’s daughter, Miranda Taylor, with problems that included substance
    abuse.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In brief reasons, the trial judge concluded
    that he was left with a reasonable doubt as to Rudge’s guilt.  Rudge was
    therefore acquitted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As I will explain, I would allow
    the Crown’s appeal from acquittal and order a new trial on the grounds that the
    trial judge (1) failed to examine the evidence as whole in relation to the
    ultimate question of guilt, and (2) failed to factor into his analysis
    important evidence relevant to a key issue.  In my opinion, the combination of
    these errors invalidates the acquittal and a new trial is called for.</span></p>

    the following facts, none of which are in dispute.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Leak Investigation was
    triggered by a document that contained information that the Outlaws, a rival
    motorcycle gang, intended to re-open its St. Catharine’s chapter.  The
    information included names, photographs and current places of residence of
    Outlaws members.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The document originated from the
    Port Colborne police detachment where a monitor had secretly been installed on the
    printer used by the officers. Logs, produced by the monitor revealed that five
    confidential police documents relating to biker gangs had been printed.  The officer
    who printed one of the documents provided it to the investigators together with
    an acceptable explanation as to why he had printed it.  Rudge printed the four remaining
    documents.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Subsequent to this discovery, on
    September 28, 2006, the police involved in Project Tandem executed several
    search warrants at premises under the control of the Hell’s Angels or their
    members, including the Cedar Bay Inn in Port Colborne, the Hell’s Angels
    Clubhouse in Welland, the home of Ken Wagner and Sandra Taylor in Port Colborne,
    and the home of Gerald Ward, a “full patch” member of the Hell’s Angels in Welland.</span></p>

    connect Rudge to the documents, follows.</span></p>

    owned by Ken Wagner and operated by Sandra Taylor.  In their search of the Inn,
    the police discovered the following two documents in the office from which
    Sandra Taylor managed the Inn:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A calendar indicating Rudge’s work shifts for the year 2006</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown relied on the fact that Rudge’s fingerprints
    were found on the calendar and evidence that Rudge had visited Taylor at the
    Inn.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A photocopy of a police memorandum containing information about the
    Hell’s Angels’ presence at the Inn, and about various investigative approaches</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown relied on the fact that the original
    memorandum had been read to officers on duty and then stored in an unmarked
    binder kept on a shelf in the briefing room behind the sergeant’s desk in the
    Port Colborne police detachment.  The document had not been distributed.   </p>

    “Mercuri document”)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown called evidence that the document could
    only have been acquired by someone with access to the Welland detachment.  Rudge
    had such access.  The detachment was staffed 24 hours a day.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A copy of a General Occurrence Report concerning Mr. Wagner, discovered together
    with the Mercuri document</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown relied on the fact that the original document
    was stored in a filing cabinet in the Port Colborne police detachment where
    Rudge worked.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A copy of a BEU Outlaw Bulletin, found in a truck in front of the Wagner/Taylor
    home (the “Outlaws bulletin”)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown relied on the fact that Rudge’s
    fingerprints were found on the Outlaws bulletin and that the printer log
    indicated that he had printed it on May 2, 2006.  Furthermore, the document
    contained, in Sandra Taylor’s handwriting, information about where some of the Outlaws
    lived.  This information was only available to those who could retrieve it from
    a password-protected program on a police computer.  Rudge initially denied
    having received the training necessary for him to access this information, but
    later admitted to having received the training.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    pictures of gang members</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown relied on the fact that Rudge’s
    fingerprints were on the document.  The printer logs indicated that on April
    16, 2006, Rudge had printed two copies of the Bulletin.  The other copy was
    located in Rudge’s locker.  </p>

    intelligence bulletin (the “Clute document”).  The Clute document indicated
    that a certain informant had provided police with information about Clute’s
    involvement with the Niagara Hell’s Angels.  The police recovered the Clute
    document from Clute on July 26.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown relied on the printer logs to show that
    Rudge was the only person who printed the Clute document and that he had done
    so on May 2, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some time prior to June 9, 2006, another confidential intelligence
    bulletin indicating that John Cane, a known biker, and Jason Meyer had opened
    an establishment in Beamsville called the Dark Side Tattoo, was seen in Cane’s possession.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While this document was never recovered, the Crown again
    relied on the printer logs to demonstrate that this document had been printed only
    by Rudge and that he had printed it on May 4, 2006.</p>

    each other by cell phone the day after she had complained about Miranda’s being
    picked up in a police car after being found by Rudge standing on the street,
    malnourished and in a drug-induced haze.  An eight-month gap in communication
    followed.  Cell phone contact between Rudge and Sandra Taylor resumed in January
    2006 and the records show a cluster of calls in the months of March, April, and
    May 2006.  According to the Crown, this timing was significant as Rudge printed
    one of the four confidential documents in issue in April and the other three in
    May. The last recorded call during this period took place on June 10, 2006.  </span></p>

    street, he tried to help her.  He described assisting her in resolving conflicts
    with numerous local businesses over her alleged shoplifting activities and, on

    this case is extremely limited is not contested.  Under s. 676(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, the Attorney General has the right to appeal against an acquittal “on
    any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone.” The Supreme Court has,
    on a number of occasions, provided assistance in relation to the narrow limits
    of the appellate jurisdiction granted by this provision.  The point
    consistently made is that the Crown is not entitled to contest an acquittal on
    the basis of an error of fact or of mixed fact and law. This limitation has
    been interpreted to preclude the Crown from arguing that an acquittal was
    unreasonable or, provided the trial judge took a legally correct approach to
    the evidence, that the verdict was not supported by the evidence: see: <i>R. v.
    B.(G.)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at<i> </i>pp. 70-71; and <i>R. v. Morin</i>,

    acquittal, the Crown is also required to demonstrate with a reasonable degree
    of certainty, that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the
    error not been made: see <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374; <i>R.
    v. Graveline, </i>[2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 16; and <i>R. v. Sutton, </i>[2000]
    2 S.C.R. 595, at para. 2. An appeal by the Attorney General cannot succeed on a

    but for the error of law. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>43.       Mr. Rudge was vigorously cross-examined
    by the Crown and for the most part his story remained unchallenged. I accept
    that he was helping Miranda Taylor overcome her drug, boyfriend and education
    problems. I accept as well that this necessitated him being in contact with her
    mother Sandra Taylor either by phone or in person and these conversations were
    personal and logically would be done privately. Although some calls were
    clustered in months which had key dates in the prosecution of suspects in
    Project Tandem, many other calls were clustered at no specific time.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>45.       I find that some of the documents found
    in Hell’s Angels locations were printed by Mr. Rudge and therefore handled by
    him. I also find that he, like most of what I heard about protocols at the Port
    Colborne detachment, was less than perfect about securing these documents. They
    appear to have been accessible to potentially many people.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>46.       I have considered at length the evidence
    of Mr. Rudge regarding his explanation about losing track of his work calendar
    for 2006 and it ending up at the Cedar Bay Inn when he had initially prepared
    it for his girlfriend; his assertions that he regularly handed out documents to
    fellow officers at briefings which was denied by several officers; his innocent
    explanation about obtaining a police profile for Diane Gale’s brother; the
    cluster of some calls to Sandra Taylor during key times in the Project Tandem
    investigation. Indeed some of these explanations raise suspicion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>48.       I also accept as logical Mr. Rudge’s
    statement that when he was a very young officer he printed a confidential
    police document for a woman to warn her that her then boyfriend had a criminal
    record. He was caught and disciplined and says he thereby learned his lesson.</p>

    This included the obligation to take into account the evidence relevant to whether
    the confidential police documents, each of which could be connected to Rudge,
    came into the possession of the Hell’s Angels from someone other than Rudge taking
    them from the Port Colborne detachment.  And then, if so, the unlikely
    coincidence that the thief provided them to Sandra Taylor <i>at around the same
    time</i> as Rudge was having extensive phone contact with her, much of which
    took place while he was off-duty and coincided with activity associated with
    the two investigations.</span></p>

    reasons, why he accepted Rudge’s position that his cell phone contact with
    Sandra Taylor was personal and innocent, there is no indication that the trial
    judge considered the communications in the context of the other evidence.  While
    the trial judge does note that some of the phone calls were clustered in months
    that had “key dates in the prosecution of Project Tandem”, he dismissed the
    balance of the calls as being “clustered at no specific time”.  This was a significant
    misapprehension of the evidence.  In fact, a large number of calls were also
    clustered around the very times during which the documents were being copied by
    Rudge.  The trial judge did not address the phone calls in the context of this
    important connection.  In short, he failed to examine the relevance of the
    phone calls in the light of the extensive evidence about the circumstances

    possibility that someone else wrongly acquired them and provided them to the
    Hell’s Angels, through Sandra Taylor.  In his examination of the document evidence,
    the trial judge does refer, at para. 46, to “the cluster of some calls to
    Sandra Taylor during key times in the Project Tandem investigation”.  However,
    once again, this mention falls short of a consideration of the evidence as a
    whole.  Moreover, by that point in his reasoning the trial judge had, through his
    piecemeal approach to the evidence, already accepted a benign explanation for

    key arguments and the live issue: whether a reasonable doubt arose from the suggestion

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>The underlying legal principle is
    set out in another decision called <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
    345.&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle is that it is an error of law to subject
    individual pieces of evidence to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt; the evidence must be looked at as a whole: see e.g., <i>B. (G.)</i>, at
    pp. 75-77 and 79<i>.</i>&nbsp; However, Sopinka J. sounded an important warning
    about how this error may be identified.&nbsp; It is a misapplication<i> </i>of
    the <i>Morin</i> principle to apply it whenever a trial judge fails to deal
    with each<i> </i>piece of evidence or record each piece of evidence and his or
    her assessment of it. As noted in <i>Morin</i> (1992), at p. 296, “A trial
    judge must consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue but
    unless the reasons demonstrate that this was not done, the failure to record
    the fact of it having been done is not a proper basis for concluding that there
    was an error of law in this respect.”</p>

    this case.  The evidence was not looked at as a whole, an error that invites the
    corresponding error of the application of the criminal standard of proof to
    individual items of evidence.  In addition, not all of the evidence was

    addressed the issue of an adverse inference in the context of the Crown’s
    failure to call a witness in <i>R. v. Jolivet</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751.  The
    general rule, applicable in both civil and criminal cases, is that all evidence
    is to be weighed according to the proof that one side is capable of producing
    and the other side is capable of contradicting. In the criminal context, the
    general rule is subject to many conditions to account for the peculiar division
    of responsibilities between the Crown and the defence. First, the party against
    whom an adverse inference is sought may provide a satisfactory account for its
    failure to produce a witness (para. 26).  Second, there is a stronger basis for
    the drawing of an adverse interest where one party has special access to the
    potential witness (para. 27). Additionally, attention must be paid to the exact
    nature of the adverse inference sought to be drawn.  Binnie J. stated the
    following, at para. 28:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>In
    J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (2nd
    ed. 1999), at p. 297, para. 6.321, it is pointed out that the failure to call
    evidence may, depending on the circumstances, amount &quot;to an implied
    admission that the evidence of the absent witness would be contrary to the
    party's case, <i>or at least would not support it</i>&quot;, as stated in the
    civil case of <i>Murray v. Saskatoon</i>, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 499 (Sask. C.A.), at
    p. 506. The circumstances in which trial counsel decide not to call a
    particular witness may restrict the nature of the appropriate &quot;adverse
    inference&quot;. Experienced trial lawyers will often decide against calling an
    available witness because the point has been adequately covered by another
    witness, or an honest witness has a poor demeanour, or other factors unrelated
    to the truth of the testimony. Other jurisdictions also recognize that in many
    cases the most that can be inferred is that the testimony would not have been
    helpful to a party, not necessarily that it would have been adverse”. [Emphasis

    into his analysis of the issue of whether the Crown had established that it was
    Rudge who provided the confidential police documents to the Hell’s Angels. 
    This involved a considered assessment of the plausibility of the
