  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of robbery and weapons dangerous arising out
    of a robbery that took place in a van.  In this conviction appeal, he raises
    three issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He submits that (1) the trial judge improperly relied on a statement
    given to police by his co-accused; (2) the verdicts were unreasonable in that
    they were not supported by the evidence; and (3) the reasons were inadequate
    for the purposes of meaningful appellate review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent concedes that, in convicting the appellant, the trial
    judge erred in making brief reference to the statement of the co-accused. 
    However, relying on the <i>proviso</i>, he submits that the verdicts would
    otherwise have been the same.  Furthermore, there was ample support in the
    evidence for these verdicts and the analysis of how the trial judge came to the
    conclusion that the Crown had made out its case beyond a reasonable doubt, was adequately
    explained in the reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is clear that the trial judge did err in referring as he did to
    the information contained in the co-accused’s statement, we would not interfere
    with the verdicts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the evidence against the appellant provided by those in the
    van at the time of the robbery, including that of the complainant, was
    compelling, as long as the trial judge accepted it.  And he did.  This
    evidence, coming from people who were acquainted with the appellant through
    school, put the appellant in the van as a participant in the victimization of
    the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the specific part of the reasons where the trial judge brings
    together the evidence relevant to his analysis of whether the Crown had made
    out its case in relation to the appellant are brief, other parts of the 25-page
    judgment contain qualitative comments on this evidence.  These comments assist
    in explaining how the trial judge came to reject the appellant’s evidence and
    find that it did not raise a reasonable doubt and then conclude that the
    prosecution, on the evidence upon which it relied, had proven the charges
    against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
