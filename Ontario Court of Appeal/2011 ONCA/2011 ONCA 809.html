  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 2, 2006, a gas leak in Mr. Boutin’s water heater led to an
    explosion that damaged his house as well as the houses of many of his
    neighbours.  Mr. Boutin and his neighbours faced a two-year limitation period for
    claims arising from the explosion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 1, 2008, some of the affected homeowners, including Mr.
    Lockett, commenced this action against Mr. Boutin as well as certain companies
    that had installed and serviced the hot water heater.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 7, 2008, counsel for the appellants received a copy of a
    statement of claim issued on September 29, 2008 by Mr. Boutin and other of the
    affected homeowners.  The Boutin statement of claim named the same services companies
    as defendants.  However, it also named Direct Energy Marketing Ltd., Enbridge
    Services Inc. and Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. as defendants.  The Enbridge
    companies were alleged to have warranted the hot water heater and to have failed
    to ensure its proper installation and repair.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of calculating their limitation period, the appellants’
    counsel decided their receipt of the Boutin claim was the date upon which they
    “discovered” that the appellants may have had a potential action against Direct
    Energy and the Enbridge companies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 18, 2010, the appellants moved to add Direct Energy and the
    Enbridge companies as defendants.  Direct Energy and Enbridge Services
    consented to the motion, provided they had leave to raise the limitation
    defence at trial.  However, Enbridge Gas resisted the motion on the basis that
    the appellants’ claim against it was barred by the expiry of the applicable two-year
    limitation period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The original supporting affidavit on the motion came from appellants’ counsel’s
    legal assistant.  It contained no evidence of any due diligence in identifying the
    Enbridge companies as potentially liable defendants in the initial two-year
    limitation period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legal assistant filed a supplementary affidavit.  However, the
    supplementary affidavit only stated that the assistant was not convinced by the
    Boutin claim of the Enbridge companies’ involvement, and that they only became
    aware of a possible claim from information obtained at discoveries in late 2009
    and early 2010, including that the persons who performed the maintenance on the
    hot water heater were trained by or acted as agents of the Enbridge companies. 
    The legal assistant’s affidavit contained no reference to any steps taken in
    the two years preceding October 2, 2008 to identify the ownership of and
    responsibility for the hot water heater and its installation and maintenance.  
    Finally, the affidavit did not annex copies of the expert reports that were
    said to have formed the basis for the appellants’ decision not to add the
    Enbridge companies as parties to the original statement of claim.  It also did
    not state when these expert reports were received and reviewed in the initial
    two-year period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in light of the record before the motion judge, there was no
    evidence of any effort by the appellants, prior to the expiry of the limitation
    period, to determine the identity and potential liability of the persons who owned,
    supplied, installed or maintained the water heater.  In these circumstances,
    the motion judge was entitled to conclude that the appellants had failed to
    demonstrate due diligence and to dismiss the motion due to the expiration of
    the two-year limitation period.  The appeal on this issue cannot succeed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise a second issue, which is resolved on consent. 
    Counsel agree that the motion judge erred in failing to grant a consent
    amendment to the amount of damages claimed by the appellant Lockett.  In
    accordance with that consent, paragraph 1 of the motion judge’s order of June
    23, 2011 is set aside and replaced with an order amending the statement of
    claim to increase the amount of the Lockett claim for damages by the additional
    amount of $137,446.40 for a total of $205,373.81.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enbridge Gas is entitled to costs of the appeal, fixed in the agreed
    amount of $7,500, inclusive of disbursements and all applicable taxes.</p>
