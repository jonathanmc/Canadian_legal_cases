    At the time of the accident, approximately two centimeters of snow had fallen

    located within the Town’s boundaries. Under the terms of this agreement, Derry

    2001, c. 25, sets out the statutory scheme pursuant to which a municipality is
    required to maintain the highways under its jurisdiction and the consequences
    for default when damages ensue.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 44(1) defines the duty.  It reads as

    is reasonable in the circumstances, including the character and location of the
    highway or bridge.  </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-US>While s. 44(1) is

    in the circumstances” test set out in subsection (1).</span></p>

    maintain a highway in a state of repair that is reasonable in the
    circumstances, knew or ought to reasonably have known of the faulty state of
    repair, and did not take steps to prevent the default.  To use the common law

    road.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is common ground that Derry Road was a class

    not apply to the circumstances of this case and, thus, did not afford the
    appellants with a defence.  The trial judge reasoned that the obligation on the
    municipality to clear snow accumulation either while snow was continuing to
    accumulate or after accumulation had ended would only have been triggered when
    the snow on Derry Road exceeded five centimeters.  Since only two centimeters
    had accumulated, s. 4 had no application.  </span></p>

    accumulation did not apply to circumstances when there had been less than five centimeters
    accumulation.  To be clear, s. 4 of the MMS did not say that a municipality
    need not clear snow if there was less than five centimeters accumulation.  The
    section did not address that circumstance. There was no minimum standard for clearing
    accumulated snow on a class 2 highway when the accumulated snow was less than
    five centimeters.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    standard established by s. 5 did not apply.  I agree with his conclusion. 
    While I agree with the thrust of the trial judge’s reasons, I would express
    those reasons in a somewhat different way.  Section 5 was intended to create a
    minimum standard for treating a highway “after becoming aware that the roadway
    is icy”.  I do not think that it matters how the roadway became icy.  It could
    be from natural causes such as freezing rain or ice pellets.  It could have been,
    as in this case, from snow falling and covering the road and then being
    compacted by vehicles into hard packed snow and ice.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 5 of the MMS was directed at the
    situation when the roadway had become icy, not before.  The standard’s
    requirement to deploy resources and treat was triggered by knowledge that the
    roadway <i>is</i> icy – present tense – not by knowledge that it <i>may</i> or <i>will
    become</i> icy.  The standard did not address a municipality’s response to
    conditions that had not yet become icy. The standard provided for a timeline
    for treatment of the icy condition depending on the class of highway.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='page-break-after:

    directed at the appellants do not include a failure to treat the icy roadway
    within four hours of becoming aware of the icy conditions, as required by s.
    5.  The trial judge’s findings of default on the part of the municipality are
    directed at failures to take reasonable steps to avoid ice forming on Derry
    Road.  The failures, as I mention above, included failures to monitor the
    weather and to have deployed resources much earlier than was done so as to
    avoid the formation of ice.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, in my view, the trial judge was correct in
    finding that s. 5 of the MMS did apply to the failures or defaults that
    underlay his finding of liability.  I agree with the trial judge that s. 5 did
    not provide a defence to the appellants.  This conclusion is supported by the
    language of the section and by common sense.  As the trial judge said, at para.
    165:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If it were otherwise,
    municipalities could avoid any of their obligations to clear the roads of snow

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that this interpretation left
    an unacceptable gap in the regulation and that a court should interpret the
    regulation to fill the gap.  I disagree for several reasons.  First, the
    language of the two standards is clear.  Clarity, it was argued by appellants,
    was one of the purposes of creating the standards.  The drafters achieved
    clarity as to what s. 5 of the MMS applied.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(c) at the time the cause of

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The key words for present purposes are “to the
    alleged default”.  The defaults here, as found by the trial judge, were the
    failure to monitor the weather and the failure to deploy resources so as to
    prevent Derry Road from becoming icy.  The trial judge did not find the
    appellants liable for failure to treat a roadway after becoming aware that it
    was icy.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is important to note that the conclusion that
    a minimum standard did not apply to the circumstances of this case does not leave
    those circumstances unregulated.  A municipality must take steps to keep the
    highway in a reasonable state of repair having regard to all the circumstances pursuant
    to s. 44(1).  While assessing compliance with that standard will be a
    fact-specific exercise, the standard is grounded in reasonableness.  A
    municipality is required to take reasonable steps and will only be found liable
    if its conduct is found to fall below the reasonableness standard.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, it is worth pointing out that the
    Region of Halton has established its own performance standards to address the
    problem of accumulating snow on roadways.  Those standards contemplate
    monitoring the weather conditions and applying salt to the roadway prior to the
    accumulation of snow in order to form a “brine sandwich” and prevent the
    formation of ice.  I point this out simply to indicate that the Minister could
    have created a similar standard to address the situation in this case, had he
    or she chosen to do so.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary, I am of the view that the MMS did
    not establish a minimum standard to address the accumulation of less than five
    centimeters of snow on a class 2 highway, nor did it establish a minimum
    standard for the treatment of a highway before ice is formed and becomes an icy
    roadway.</span></p>

    tends to show that the drafters of the MMS intended to provide clear, bright

    evidence adds anything to the interpretative exercise that I have discussed
    above.  As a result, I would not admit the fresh evidence tendered by either

    became even more apparent to her when her car slid while she was driving 55 to
