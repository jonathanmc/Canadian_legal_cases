  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These appeals involve five appellants who have been charged and, in some
    cases, convicted of marihuana related offences contrary to the <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c. 19. The appellants have been
    frustrated by the operation of the <i>Marihuana Medical Access Regulations</i>,
    S.O.R./2001-227 and argue that the offences with which they have been charged have
    been judicially repealed. The reasons in this appeal are being released at the
    same time as the reasons in the companion cases of <i>Parker</i> and <i>Maloney.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants McCrady and Hearn appeal from convictions for marihuana related
    offences.  The appellant McCrady was convicted of possession of marihuana contrary
    to s. 4(1) of the <i>CDSA </i>by Lalande J. of the Ontario Court of Justice on
    July 19, 2010. The appellant Hearn pleaded guilty to production of marihuana
    contrary to s. 7(1) of the <i>CDSA </i>in the Ontario Court of Justice on July
    9, 2010. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants Pallister and McIntyre currently face charges for
    production and possession for the purpose of trafficking, and production and
    simple possession, respectively. The appellant MacDonald was charged with
    possession for the purpose of trafficking in December 2008. Those charges were
    stayed in December 2010. Pallister, McIntyre and MacDonald each seek orders
    prohibiting prosecution for marihuana related offences under the <i>CDSA</i> and<i> </i>staying all marihuana charges as an abuse of process. They also seek
    to have the Crown cited for contempt for continuing to prosecute marihuana
    offences. Finally, they seek to expunge the criminal records of all people
    convicted of marihuana offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We recognize the frustration expressed by each of the appellants about the <i>MMAR</i>. However, the marihuana offences set out in the <i>CDSA </i>have
    not been repealed and were in force when the appellants McCrady and Hearn were
    convicted. The remedies sought by the appellants Pallister, McIntyre and
    MacDonald are not available on this record. Accordingly, all the appeals are
    dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)       The Appellant McCrady</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2008, McCrady submitted an application to possess and grow
    marihuana pursuant to the <i>MMAR</i>. The application was signed by his
    medical doctor. Health Canada processed the application six months later, in
    April 2009.  On February 20, 2009, before the application was processed,
    McCrady was charged with possession and possession for the purpose of
    trafficking contrary to ss. 4 and 5 of the <i>CDSA</i>. The amount was 106
    grams, or just under four ounces. On July 19, 2010, he was acquitted of
    possession for the purpose and convicted of simple possession. McCrady was
    sentenced to 12 months of probation and a $250 fine. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2)       The Appellant Hearn</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 9, 2010, Hearn pleaded guilty to production of <i>cannabis</i> contrary to s. 7 of the <i>CDSA</i>. The offence occurred on April 22, 2009 and
    involved 69 plants. On October 25, 2010 Hearn was sentenced to a $500 fine. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3)       The Appellant Pallister</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that on October 2, 2009, police executed a <i>CDSA </i>search
    warrant at a residence in Thornbury, Ontario and seized approximately 450 <i>cannabis</i> plants, along with a quantity of cannabis. The appellant Pallister was charged
    with production of <i>cannabis</i>, possession of <i>cannabis</i> and
    possession for the purpose of trafficking, together with several co-accused. The
    charges were set to be heard by the Superior Court of Justice on November 29,
    2011.  While his charges were still before the Ontario Court of Justice,
    Pallister brought an application before the Superior Court for declaratory
    relief with respect to the validity of the offences. On March 26, 2010,
    O’Connor J. dismissed the application. Pallister appeals from O’Connor J.’s
    decision. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)       The Appellant McIntyre</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that on January 7, 2010, the police executed a <i>CDSA </i>search
    warrant at a residence in the Township of Douro-Dummer and seized three pounds
    of marihuana and 1383 <i>cannabis</i> plants. McIntyre was charged with
    production of <i>cannabis</i> and possession of <i>cannabis</i>. Those charges
    are still before the courts. McIntyre brought an application before the
    Superior Court of Justice for declaratory relief with respect to the validity
    of the offences with which she is charged. Gunsolus J. dismissed the
    application on December 9, 2010. McIntyre appeals that decision. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(5)       The Appellant MacDonald</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that on December 8, 2008, the police executed a <i>CDSA </i>search
    warrant at a residence in Otonabee-South Monaghan Township and seized a large
    quantity of <i>cannabis</i>. The appellant MacDonald was charged with
    possession of <i>cannabis</i> for the purpose of trafficking. MacDonald brought
    an application before the Superior Court of Justice seeking declaratory relief
    with respect to the validity of the offence. On October 27, 2010, Gilmore J.
    dismissed the application. On December 8, 2010, the charge against MacDonald
    was stayed. MacDonald appeals from Gilmore J.’s decision.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES ON APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants McCrady and Hearn appeal their convictions. They raise
    the following issues:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (1)       Their
    charges should have been quashed, as marihuana is no longer a controlled
    substance.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (2)       Their
    charges should have been judicially stayed, as marihuana no longer should be a
    controlled substance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants Pallister, MacDonald and McIntyre raise the following
    issues respecting marihuana offences:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>(1)       The
    combined effect of the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>R. v.
    Parker </i>(2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 481,<i> </i>[<i>Parker </i>(2000)]; <i>Hitzig
    v. Canada</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 449<i> </i>(Ont. C.A.)<i>, </i>and <i>R.
    v. J.P.</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 321<i> </i>is the repeal of the marihuana
    prohibitions. This deemed repeal has never been remedied.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (2)       The
    decision in <i>R. v. Krieger</i>, 2000 ABQB 1012 is deemed to have repealed the
    marihuana production offence in s. 7 of the <i>CDSA</i>.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (3)       The
    decisions in <i>Sfetkopoulos v. Canada (A.G.)</i>, 2008 FC 33, <i>Sfetkopoulos
    v. Canada (A.G.)</i>, 2008 FCA 328<i> </i>and <i>R. v. Beren</i>, 2009 BCSC 429<i> </i>have invalidated the marihuana prohibition retroactive to at least December
    3, 2003.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>STANDING</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown challenges the standing of the appellants Pallister, McIntyre
    and MacDonald to obtain the broad forms of relief they sought in their notices
    of application. It is open to Pallister and McIntyre to defend the criminal
    charges brought against them by challenging the constitutional validity of the
    laws under which their charges are brought. The charges against MacDonald have already
    been withdrawn, thus he no longer has standing for this type of argument. The
    standing of Pallister, McIntyre and MacDonald to seek the broader forms of
    relief such as prohibiting prosecution of marihuana offences would depend upon
    whether they should be given public interest standing in accordance with the
    test set out in <i>Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada</i>,[1992] 1 S.C.R.
    236.  We have decided not to address the standing issue because we are satisfied
    that their claims can be disposed of by dealing with the issues raised on the
    merits. Their claims for relief all hinge on the theory that the marihuana
    prohibitions in the <i>CDSA</i> have not been in effect since August 1, 2001,
    what the appellants refer to as Terry Parker Day. For the reasons developed
    below, that argument has no merit. While the marihuana possession prohibition
    was not in force from July 31, 2001 to October 7, 2003 as a result of the
    combined effect of <i>Parker</i> (2000) and <i>Hitzig</i>, that offence as well
    as the production offence in the <i>CDSA</i>, have been in force since October
    7, 2003. No court, so far as we are aware, has ever struck down the possession
    for the purpose offence. That offence has always been in force.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENTS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The history in Ontario of the issues raised by the appellants begins
    with this court’s decision in <i>Parker</i> (2000)<i>. </i>That history is more
    fully set out in our reasons in Mr.&nbsp;Parker’s case which are being released
    at the same time as these reasons. These reasons must be read with the reasons
    in Mr. Parker’s case to fully appreciate the history of the arguments raised by
    these appellants. Mr. Parker suffered from a severe form of epilepsy which he
    found was alleviated better by smoked marihuana than by conventional treatment.
    At his criminal trial he challenged the constitutionality of the <i>CDSA </i>criminal
    prohibition of marihuana possession on the basis that it infringed his s. 7 <i>Charter </i>rights to liberty and security of the person. This court agreed, declaring
    the provision invalid to the extent of the constitutional inconsistency, but
    suspending its declaration for 12 months to give the government time to craft a
    legislative response. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to <i>Parker</i> (2000) the federal government enacted the <i>MMAR</i>,
    which came into force on July 30, 2001. In <i>Hitzig </i>this court determined
    that the <i>MMAR </i>regime was unconstitutional as it did not adequately
    provide for a lawful supply of marihuana. Importantly, however, the court in <i>Hitzig </i>did not strike down the <i>MMAR </i>in its entirety or declare s. 4 of the <i>CDSA </i>to be of no force or effect.  Rather, this court brought the <i>MMAR </i>into
    compliance with the <i>Charter </i>by striking down s. 41(b) (which prohibited
    a licensed producer from growing for more than one authorized-to-possess holder)
    and s. 54 (which prohibited more than three licensed producers from producing
    in common). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hitzig </i>created a retrospective period of invalidity of the
    prohibition of marihuana possession dating back to July 31, 2001 (the date that
    the suspension of invalidity in <i>Parker</i> (2000) ran out). Going forward, <i>Hitzig </i>made the prohibition of marihuana possession fully constitutional in
    Ontario as of October 7, 2003 (the date of the <i>Hitzig </i>decision). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following <i>Hitzig </i>the federal government passed the <i>Regulations
    Amending the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations</i>,<i> </i>SOR/2003-387. A
    new provision was added to Part IV of the <i>MMAR</i> which enabled the
    Government’s supply of dried marihuana to be shipped directly to persons
    authorized-to-possess. Sections 41(b) and 54 were re-enacted in their original
    form as sections 41(b.1) and 54.1. As we explain in <i>Parker</i>, the fact
    that the government re-enacted ss. 41(b) and 54, when it revised the <i>MMAR </i>in
    response to <i>Hitzig</i>, did not retroactively resurrect the effect of the <i>Parker</i> (2000) decision striking down the prohibition.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The declaration of invalidity made by this court in <i>Parker, supra</i>, does not delete marihuana from Schedule II of the <i>CDSA</i>.
    It simply declares that the reference to marihuana in Schedule II is of no
    force or effect for the purposes of the possession charge in s. 4 of the <i>CDSA</i>.
    The declaration does not extend to any other section of the <i>CDSA</i>. In
    particular, it does not diminish the effect of the listing of marihuana in
    Schedule II for the purposes of s. 5(2) of the <i>CDSA</i>.</p>

    Mr. Krieger used marihuana to alleviate his suffering from multiple sclerosis,
    the production prohibition in s. 7(1) of the <i>CDSA </i>infringed his s. 7 <i>Charter </i>rights to liberty and security of the person. The court held that s. 7(1)
    was of no force and effect with respect to marihuana production. The
    declaration of invalidity was suspended for one year to give the government
    time to arrange for a legal source of marihuana for therapeutic use. The
    Alberta Court of Appeal extended the suspension of the declaration “until
    further order of the Court”. That suspension has never been lifted. In the
    interim, the <i>Hitzig </i>line of cases resulted in the <i>MMAR </i>which allow
    for lawful access to marihuana for therapeutic use. The constitutional defect
    identified in <i>Krieger </i>was thereby remedied during the period of
    suspension and the declaration of invalidity is now moot. </p>

    adequately address the issue of lawful supply first canvassed in <i>Hitzig</i>.
    He declared s. 41(b.1) of the <i>MMAR </i>(which prohibited the holder of a
    production license from growing for more than one ATP-holder) invalid. He did
    not, however, strike down any of the prohibitions in the <i>CDSA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R. v. Beren </i>involved a prosecution for production and trafficking
    in marihuana. Koenigsberg J. of the Birtish Columbia Supreme Court relied on <i>Sfetkopolous</i> and held that ss. 41(b.1) and 54.1 of the <i>MMAR </i>infringed s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    No provision of the <i>CDSA </i>was found to be invalid in <i>Beren</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that, by analogy to <i>Hitzig </i>and <i>J.P.</i>,<i> Sfetkopolous</i> and <i>Beren </i>have the effect of invalidating all marihuana
    offences retroactively dating back to December 3, 2003. This argument fails for
    several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, <i>Hitzig </i>and <i>J.P. </i>only affected the constitutionality
    of the offence of simple possession of marihuana, not the offences of
    production or possession for the purpose of trafficking. The foundational
    declaration of invalidity in <i>Parker</i> (2000) simply declares that the
    reference to marihuana in Schedule II is of no force and effect for the purposes
    of the possession charge in s. 4 of the <i>CDSA</i>. The declaration does not
    extend to any other section of the <i>CDSA</i> (<i>Turmel, </i>(2003) at para.
    6). Thus, if the appellant’s argument had merit it could only apply to the
    simple possession charges against the appellants McCrady, Pallister and
    McIntyre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the period of retroactive invalidity that the appellants argue
    for would not apply to any of them:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (a)       Retroactive
    invalidity would only work backward from the date of <i>Sfetkopoulos. </i>The
    offence dates in the cases of MacDonald, McCrady and Hearn (December 8, 2008,
    February 20, 2009 and April 22, 2009, respectively) are after January 10, 2008 when
    the <i>Sfetkopoulos </i>declaration remedied the <i>Sfetkopoulos </i>problem. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>            (b)       The
    offence dates in the cases of Pallister and McIntyre (October 2, 2009 and
    January 7, 2010, respectively) are after paragraph 41(b.1) of the <i>MMAR </i>was
    amended in response to <i>Sfetkopoulos </i>on May 14, 2009. No court has found
    the amended regulation unconstitutional.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the offence dates in the cases of McCrady, Hearn, Pallister and
    McIntyre (February 20, 2009, April 22, 2009, October 2, 2009, and January 7,
    2010, respectively) are during the one-year <i>Beren </i>suspension of
    invalidity, which began on February 2, 2009. Maloney’s offence date (June 6, 2010)
    is after the <i>MMAR </i>were amended in response to <i>Beren</i>,<i> </i>on
    March 11, 2010. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, although the trial judge in <i>Beren </i>declared ss. 41(b.1)
    and 54.1 of the <i>MMAR </i>invalid, she made findings of guilt under the <i>CDSA </i>(at para. 136). Thus, <i>Beren </i>upheld the production and trafficking
    offences as they relate to persons who do not have ATPs under the <i>MMAR</i>. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         The charges against McCrady and Hearn should
    not be stayed</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants McCrady and Hearn, submit that the charges against them
    should be stayed as marihuana no longer should be a controlled substance. The
    record does not support this position. The appellants submit a list of 25
    complaints related to the <i>MMAR</i>. The complaints are not grounded in
    evidence in the record placed before the trial courts or this court. In so far
    as the complaints reference <i>Sfetkopoulos </i>and <i>Beren</i>, the
    appellant’s argument<i> </i>is addressed above. The appellants also make reference
    to the trial decision in <i>R. v. Mernagh, </i>2011 ONSC 2121. In that case, Taliano
    J. declared that the prohibitions against possession and production of
    marihuana in ss. 4 and 7 of the <i>CDSA </i>are invalid.  However, this court has
    already extended the <i>Mernagh </i>suspension of invalidity pending appeal.<span

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BENO ARGUMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These appeals are some of many cases that have recently found their way
    to this court either as conviction appeals or attempts at prerogative remedies.
    They all turn on an argument referred to by the appellants as BENO (Bad
    Exemption = No Offence). By the reasons in this appeal and in the companion
    appeal in <i>Parker</i> it should now be apparent that this argument cannot
    succeed. This court and other courts have dealt with the so-called Bad
    Exemption by reading in words to fix the constitutional infirmity or by striking
    down the exemption. It was only in <i>Hitzig</i> that the effect of the Bad
    Exemption was to retroactively render of no force and effect the s. 4 <i>CDSA </i>possession
    prohibition as it related to marihuana. That order gave effect to the order of
    this court in <i>Parker</i> (2000). In <i>Parker</i> (2000),<i> </i>this court
    gave Parliament a year to fix the problem identified in that case. The effect
    of <i>Hitzig</i> was to find that Parliament had not succeeded. Hence the order
    in <i>Parker</i> (2000) declaring s. 4 as related to marihuana of no force and
    effect, took effect, but only until October 7, 2003. Put another way, the BENO
    argument only applied to the period from July 31, 2001 to October 7, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants have continuing concerns about the <i>MMAR</i> regime. In
    their view, the regime is inadequate and fatally flawed. But their views about
    the regime cannot change the fact that since October 7, 2003, with the
    exception of the 2011 decision <i>Mernagh, </i>no court has held that the
    marihuana prohibitions are invalid. Since <i>Parker</i> (2000) and <i>Krieger</i>,
    courts have dealt with defects in the <i>MMAR</i> by striking down the
    provisions or reading out offending parts of the regulations. The orders made
    in those cases including <i>Hitzig, Sfetkopoulos,</i> and <i>Beren</i>, have
    left intact the prohibitions in the <i>CDSA</i>. As we have pointed out, the <i>Parker</i> (2000)<i> </i>state of invalidity, as regards the possession offence, ended on
    October 7, 2003. The <i>Krieger</i> order of invalidity, as regards the
    cultivation offence, never took effect because of successive orders of the
    trial court and the Alberta Court of Appeal. The order made by Taliano J. in <i>Mernagh</i> holding the possession and production marihuana offences of the <i>CDSA</i> and
    the <i>MMAR </i>to be of no force and effect cannot assist the appellants at
    this point because that order has been stayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put simply, it is not open to these appellants or others who are
    dissatisfied with the <i>MMAR</i> regime to simply refuse to obey the law and
    take the position that the <i>CDSA</i> offences are not in effect. If they wish
    to now challenge the validity of any part of the <i>CDSA</i> or the <i>MMAR</i> they can do so as part of the defence to their charges or by an application in
    the Superior Court of Justice. However, that defence and any application must
    be based upon proper material that clearly demonstrates the constitutional
    infirmity of the <i>MMAR</i> and the link between the <i>CDSA</i> offences and
    the alleged infirmity in the <i>MMAR.</i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants have expressed a shared sense of frustration with the <i>MMAR</i> and the medical profession. However, the issues raised are based on a
    fundamental misreading of the state of the law. The marihuana offences set out
    in the <i>CDSA </i>remain in full force. The appeals are dismissed. </p>
