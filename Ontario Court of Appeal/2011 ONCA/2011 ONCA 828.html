  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of four firearms offences.  The firearm that
    led to these convictions was seized pursuant to a search warrant executed on
    March 17, 2009 at the appellant’s apartment residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At his trial, the appellant made a s. 8 <i>Charter</i> challenge to the
    warrant that had authorized the search of his residence for drugs.  Justice
    Harvison Young held that the search did not violate s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law when she held,
    relying upon a tip from a confidential informant that was neither compelling
    nor sufficiently corroborated, that the Information to Obtain a search warrant
    (the “<span lang=EN-US>I</span>TO”) for the appellant`s residence established
    reasonable and probable grounds to believe evidence relating to possible drug
    offences would be found at the residence.  Accordingly, the appellant submits,
    the search warrant was invalid, the search violated s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> and the evidence of the loaded firearm seized pursuant to the warrant should be
    excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  On her ruling, the trial judge
    reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While I agree that the high expectation of privacy
    in one’s home must always be kept in mind, I disagree with the conclusion that
    there was an insufficient nexus in this case.  Officer Taylor’s information was
    that Mr. Soto was dealing cocaine.  He saw Mr. Soto leave the building, get
    into the car, and then, as the ITO sets out, he and Officer Fitkin each
    observed what they believed to have been two hand-to-hand drug transactions. 
    (That is, they each saw one.)  <i>As Mr. Soto had not stopped anywhere else along
    the way before these transactions, it is reasonable to believe that he would
    have had the drugs on his person when he left the apartment.</i>                                                                             [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this reasoning is sound.  In particular, the emphasized
    passage speaks to an obvious nexus among a person, drug and location, namely,
    if a person leaves his residence, then almost immediately engages in two drug
    transactions, it follows that there is a good chance that there are drugs in
    his residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred by finding that
    the ITO was not drafted in a misleading, deliberately or otherwise, manner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dealt comprehensively with this issue and concluded that
    “the Affiant did not deliberately attempt to mislead the court, nor did he
    display such a cavalier attitude that the Court cannot find that he acted in
    good faith”.  In our view, this conclusion was entirely open to the trial judge
    on the record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant asserts that the confidential informant’s tip was
    not sufficiently compelling to support the ITO.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The informant was a known credible source, he spoke
    directly to the police officer affiant, and the police sought and obtained
    other information to confirm many of the factual details provided by the
    informant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her reasons, the trial judge said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the end of the day, the point is that there were
    reasonable and probable grounds in the circumstances to think that Mr. Soto had
    drugs on his person when he left 11 Catford Road and got into the Lincoln, and
    a reasonable inference that, as a dealer, he would have a supply in the
    apartment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> In our view, this is succinct and sensible summary of
    the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
