style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, gross indecency and
    sexual exploitation of a young girl who was the child of his spouses cousin.   The
    acts began with kissing at age 8 and progressed over the years to sexual
    touching and oral sex at age 17 and 18.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence of three years.  The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred with respect to the bases he
    described for rejecting the appellants evidence and in relying on the evidence
    of the cousins as corroborative of the complainant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge was entitled to assess the evidence of the
    appellant and to make his findings of credibility based on that evidence.  He
    was entitled to make the interpretations that he did.  He was also entitled to
    accept the evidence of the two women cousins although it was denied by the
    appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the approach of the trial judge.  The appeal against
    conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal the sentence and appeals the
    sentence of three years.  He sought a conditional sentence at trial and renews
    that submission here.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected a conditional sentence as unavailable.  He
    referred to the case law that puts the range for this type of sexual offence
    against a child by an adult in a position of trust where there was no
    penetration as a minimum of three years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred to the aggravating and mitigating factors, the
    latter of which included the appellants age (then 68), no criminal record,
    strong community ties, an operating business, a new wife and young daughter,
    and some deficiency as a result of an earlier head injury.  The trial judge
    considered that these factors caused him to give a sentence at the lower end of
    the range of three years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge adverted to all the mitigating factors and made no
    error as to the appropriate range of sentence in these circumstances, we see no
    basis to interfere with the sentence imposed.  We also see no basis to
    interfere with the corollary orders that were imposed by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
