    By asphyxia from strangulation.</span></p>

    killing of his estranged wife, Colleen Richardson-Luciano. Then Michael Luciano
    killed his friend, James Cooper.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Michael Luciano was charged with two counts of
    murder: the second degree murder of Colleen Richardson-Luciano and the first
    degree murder of James Cooper. Both counts were originally included in a single
    indictment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When Michael Luciano appeared for trial, the
    presiding judge decided that the counts should be severed and separate trials

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial of the first degree murder count
    involving the death of James Cooper proceeded first before the trial judge who
    had ordered severance. The jury heard evidence about both killings and
    convicted Luciano of first degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial of the second degree murder count
    proceeded several months later before a different judge. The jury heard
    evidence about the killing of Colleen Richardson-Luciano, but not about
    Cooper’s death or why Cooper didn’t testify at trial. They found Luciano not
    guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In each case an appeal has been taken. Luciano
    appeals his conviction of first degree murder. He alleges that the trial judge
    made a number of mistakes in his final instructions to the jury. The Attorney
    General appeals Luciano’s acquittal of second degree murder and argues that the
    trial judge was wrong in failing to admit evidence of the killing of Cooper, or
    at least evidence that Cooper was dead when the second trial occurred. Both
    appellants seek a new trial.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The circumstances that underlie the prosecution
    of Michael Luciano (Luciano) provide the context necessary for an evaluation of
    the claims of error made in connection with both trials.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principals</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>James Cooper was a 38-year-old career recidivist
    whose prior convictions included several robberies and other offences against
    the person. He had been deported to Scotland in 1998 on his release from
    penitentiary, but returned to Canada illegally a few months before his death.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Colleen Richardson-Luciano was an exotic dancer
    addicted to alcohol and cocaine. She had two children, a son, 14, and a
    daughter, 6. She pursued a somewhat nomadic lifestyle after her separation from
    Michael Luciano, the father of her children.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Like Cooper, Michael Luciano was a 38-year-old
    with a lengthy criminal record. Unlike Cooper, however, Luciano had a full-time
    job. His last criminal conviction occurred in 1992.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Relationship Among the
    Principals</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>James Cooper introduced [then] Colleen
    Richardson to Michael Luciano. The couple lived together for two years, then
    married. Their relationship was turbulent, punctuated by verbal and physical
    abuse. Despite an earlier separation, Ms. Richardson-Luciano returned from time
    to time to the basement apartment in Woodbridge where her husband and children
    lived.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prior to mid-January 2000 neither Michael
    Luciano nor his estranged wife had had any contact with James Cooper for
    several years.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Arrival of James Cooper</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On January 14, 2000, James Cooper arrived
    unbidden at Luciano’s apartment in Woodbridge. Michael Luciano was at work.
    Colleen had been staying at her estranged husband’s apartment for about a month
    prior to Cooper’s arrival. She and Cooper drank. Ms. Richardson-Luciano left
    the apartment and did not return for two days. Luciano blamed Cooper for her
    absence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Lucianos argued often. Their arguments increased
    in frequency and volume after Cooper’s arrival. Cooper also argued with Ms.
    Richardson-Luciano.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Early Evening of January
    21, 2000</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When Luciano returned home from work on Friday,
    January 21, 2000, Cooper and Colleen were in the apartment. Luciano and Colleen
    drove to a nearby liquor store to pick up some alcohol for the evening. Cooper,
    who had a walking cast on one leg, remained at the apartment with the couples’
    young daughter. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Throughout the evening of January 21, 2000,
    Cooper and the Lucianos listened to loud music, yelled and cursed. Lucianos’
    14-year-old son returned home by 11:00 p.m. and went to bed. He complained
    about the noise, but noticed nothing untoward between his parents or his
    parents and Cooper. The upstairs neighbours confirmed the din from the basement
    apartment.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Fatal Assault</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The upstairs neighbours heard the sound of a
    loud thump from the Luciano apartment around midnight or an hour later. Silence
    followed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Michael Luciano is the only living witness to
    the killing of his wife. He claimed that Colleen and Cooper argued over a
    substantial debt Cooper owed to Colleen. The debt had been outstanding for a long
    time. Cooper assured Colleen that he would never repay her. Colleen insulted
    Cooper and threatened retaliation if Cooper persisted in his refusal to pay.
    Cooper remained calm. Luciano told both combatants to “keep it down”. Colleen
    called Cooper a “fucking goof”. Cooper got up and stabbed Colleen. She
    collapsed on the floor.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Deprived of a competing eyewitness version of
    events at the trial for Colleen’s murder, the prosecutor relied upon expert
    evidence about findings at the scene to contradict Luciano’s version of events.
    Luciano also adduced evidence that portrayed Cooper as a person with a
    propensity or disposition for violence and one likely to respond violently to
    the descriptive “goof”. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Clean-Up</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Luciano and Cooper cleaned up the apartment and
    immediate area to rid it of any signs that Colleen had been killed there. The
    kitchen and stairwell were scrubbed and blood rinsed from the cleaning
    materials. They wrapped Colleen’s body in a rug, carried it to Luciano’s car
    and put it in the trunk. Luciano bumped into a neighbour’s car while turning
    his vehicle around to remove Colleen’s body from the area. He drove 12 kilometres
    from his home and deposited her body in a dumpster.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Luciano acknowledged his participation in the
    clean-up and disposal of the body, but claimed he did so only out of fear of
    Cooper who had threatened his life and the lives of his children.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Morning After</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On Saturday morning, Luciano’s daughter awakened
    him. She wanted breakfast. After breakfast, she watched television. Later,
    Luciano’s upstairs neighbour came into the apartment to speak to Luciano about
    repairing the damage to his [the neighbour’s] car. The neighbour noticed Cooper
    in the apartment. Cooper was calm and relaxed. Luciano looked like a zombie. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The neighbour returned to Luciano’s apartment
    later in the day to pursue his claim for car repairs. Luciano wanted to resolve
    the neighbour’s claim without involving the police. Either Luciano or Cooper
    suggested that the neighbour tell any investigators that the incident had
    occurred two days earlier. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Trip to Egmondville</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Egmondville is not far from Goderich. Luciano
    has several relatives in the area, including his sister and a niece, Elvina
    Wells. After a series of telephone calls from Elvina, Luciano, his daughter and
    Cooper left Woodbridge on Saturday afternoon to drive to Egmondville to visit
    Elvina Wells. They stopped twice along the way and arrived in Egmondville in
    the early evening.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Collecting Supplies</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly after the group arrived in Elvina’s home
    in Egmondville, Luciano and Elvina drove over to the homes of some of their
    relatives to collect some liquor and beer for the evening. The beer and liquor
    stores were closed. Elvina and Luciano returned to Elvina’s place with a bottle
    of rum and a dozen beers to supplement Elvina’s supplies. They began drinking
    around 8:30 p.m. Luciano’s daughter was in another room of the house. No one
    said anything about what had happened on Friday night at Luciano’s apartment.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Discussions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Cooper lay down shortly after midnight. After
    some teasing about his endurance, Cooper got up and continued to drink and to
    talk with the others. He lay down again about an hour later.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Elvina and Luciano remained at the kitchen
    table. Luciano was drunk. Elvina had polished off two magnums of wine. Luciano
    told Elvina that Cooper had killed Colleen on Friday night. Luciano was an
    “accessory”. Later, Luciano described Cooper as a “witness”. He told Elvina
    that he (Luciano) was going to “do” Cooper that evening before Cooper “did”
    him. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Elvina became very upset when Luciano told her
    about what had happened the night before and what he planned to do later. She
    telephoned her parents and asked them to come over, pick her up and take her to
    their place. Her parents arrived a few minutes later and took Elvina to their
    home. After she told them about what Luciano had said, Elvina called the
    police.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Expert evidence based on Luciano’s report of his
    alcohol consumption estimated his blood alcohol concentration at between 300
    and 330 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of  blood at 2:30 a.m. on
    Sunday, January 23, 2000.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Killing of James Cooper</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    from this that Cooper had left on foot. The officers left to find Cooper,

    the levels of intoxication that could negate the mental element necessary to

    Cooper and Michael Luciano on the evening of January 21, 2000, and into the
    early hours of the following morning was alcohol. For Elvina Wells, it was wine
    – two magnums and a start on a third. James Cooper drank beer. Micheal Luciano
    had the lion’s share of a bottle of rum, then converted to peach schnapps.</span></p>

    proportions at between 300 and 330 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of
    blood at around the time Luciano caused Cooper’s death. Another expert
    explained the effect of such a blood-alcohol concentration on a person’s

    liability because it occurred by accident during a consensual, thus, lawful

    Luciano also relied on evidence of intoxication to confine his criminal
    liability to the crime of manslaughter. </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To establish Luciano’s guilt of first degree
    murder as the sole principal, the prosecutor relied on the definition of murder
    in s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. To establish that the murder was
    first degree murder, the prosecutor invoked s. 231(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:
    the murder was planned and deliberate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In cases like this, of planned and deliberate
    first degree murder, in this province and in others, judges instruct jurors
    about the essential elements of first degree murder in a series of steps. These
    step directions include instructions about the mental or fault element required
    to make an unlawful killing murder, and about the added requirement that the
    murder be planned and deliberate to amount to first degree murder; evidence of
    intoxication is a relevant consideration at both steps.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the trial judge wandered off the
    conventional path of step-directions. He combined, in a single instruction
    about “the state of mind required for first degree murder”, brief mention of
    the intent to kill and parts of the specimen charge on planned and deliberate
    first degree murder. The trial judge did not provide jurors with the specimen
    or any instruction about the mental or fault element in murder as defined in s.
    229(a)(ii). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his instructions about planning and deliberation,
    the trial judge listed several factors for the jurors to consider. Included in
    the list were Luciano’s condition, state of mind, and the degree of his
    intoxication. The trial judge continued:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>All these
    things and the circumstances in which they happened, including the evidence
    about how much alcohol he drank and over how long, the opinion of the experts,
    Drs. LeBlanc and Ervin who testified about Mr. Luciano’s state of mind as
    affected by the consumption of alcohol, the acute stress disorder, the exhaustion
    from being deprived of sleep, may shed light on his state of mind at the time
    he allegedly committed the offence charged. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>All this
    evidence may help you decide what he meant or didn’t mean to do and whether he
    planned and deliberated or did not plan and deliberate. Along with this

    Cooper and what he said to them about the death.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>In considering

lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge gave jurors specific
    instructions about intoxication. He referred to the common sense inference of
    intention from conduct as a means by which state of mind could be proven and
    explained that, in deciding whether to draw the inference, the jury was
    required to take into account the evidence of Luciano’s alcohol consumption and
    its effects. He related intoxication to part of the fault element in murder and
    to a “planned and deliberate killing” in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Drunkenness becomes a defence for first degree
    murder if it precludes a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of the specific
    intent to kill and the planning and deliberation required for first degree
    murder at the time of the act of asphyxiation, or if it raises a reasonable
    doubt about it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you find that Mr. Luciano had consumed alcohol,
    you may consider the effect of that consumption upon him along with the other
    facts bearing on his intent to kill and on his planning and deliberation in
    determining whether he had the requisite state of mind for first degree murder.</p>

lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The instructions on intoxication followed the
    two-step approach of <i>R. v. MacKinlay</i> (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 306 (Ont.
    C.A.), rather than the one-step format of <i>R. v. Canute</i> (1993), 80 C.C.C.
    (3d) 403 (B.C. C.A.), but emphasized that what the jury had to decide was
    Luciano’s <i>actual</i> intent at the time of the killing. The trial judge also
    gave the jurors the “rolled-up” instruction on the issue of “the state of mind”
    required for first degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge left three verdicts for the

  </blockquote>
  <p style='
line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-US>The listed verdicts did not
    include “not guilty of first degree murder, but guilty of second degree
    murder”. Nor did the instructions distinguish, in express terms, between the
    level of intoxication that may raise a reasonable doubt about the fault element
    required in murder under s. 229(a), on the one hand, and the degree of
    intoxication that may negate the deliberation component of planned and deliberate
    first degree murder on the other.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Positions of the Parties on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For Luciano, Mr. Dineen says that the
    instructions on intoxication contained several errors that, in combination,
    command our intervention.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, Mr. Dineen contends that the trial
    judge’s review of the expert evidence about alcohol consumption and its effects
    was freighted with negative characterizations about what it did <i>not</i> prove, automatistic behaviour, rather than about what it did and how it related
    to the factual findings the jury was required to make.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, Mr. Dineen urges, the trial judge
    denigrated and interpreted the expert evidence for the jury, rather than
    reviewing it objectively for the jurors, leaving its effect on the adequacy of
    the prosecutor’s proof of the critical mental elements for the jurors to
    decide. In his instructions, the trial judge posited that Luciano had an
    operating mind, a state belied by the expert evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, Mr. Dineen continues, the trial judge was
    wrong in failing to leave second degree murder as an available verdict. The
    trial judge made no mention of second degree murder in his final instructions.
    The verdict was reasonably available on the evidence, despite the joint
    position of Luciano’s experienced trial counsel and the prosecutor that the
    verdict should not be left. If the jurors had a reasonable doubt that the
    murder of James Cooper was deliberate, for example because of the effects of
    intoxication, the proper verdict would have been not guilty of first degree
    murder but guilty of second degree murder. Part of the problem was that the
    trial judge never told the jurors that a lesser degree of intoxication could
    negate deliberation than might raise a reasonable doubt about the fault element
    in murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the respondent, Mr. Stewart characterizes
    the instructions on intoxication as fair and balanced, thorough and effective.
    He points out that the trial judge’s instructions on intoxication were directed
    at two discrete issues, thus served two different purposes. The first had to do
    with Luciano’s claim that the conduct that caused Cooper’s death was not
    unlawful because it was either accidental or occurred in lawful self-defence.
    And the second required the judge to relate intoxication as a “stand alone
    defence” to the essential elements of first degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart says that it was not wrong for the
    trial judge to clear away any suggestion of automatistic behaviour that may
    have emerged from the expert evidence. Automatism was not and could not be
    advanced as a defence in this case. By clearing it out of the way, the trial
    judge could and did focus on the relevance of intoxication to the issues of
    this case. Any interpretive references the trial judge made to the expert
    evidence were for the purpose of confining it to its legitimate purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to Mr. Stewart, the instructions on
    the substantive defence of intoxication expressly related it to accident,
    self-defence, intent to kill, planning and deliberation and even to
    manslaughter. Nothing was said that was wrong. The two-step charge was
    appropriate because of the manner in which the experts expressed their opinions
    and the degree of intoxication advanced. In any event, the instructions made it
    clear that the issue the jury was to determine was Luciano’s <i>actual</i> intent, not his capacity to form intent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart contends that the failure to
    instruct on second degree murder does not constitute error<i>.</i> The trial
    judge simply gave effect to the express agreement of experienced counsel about
    the available verdicts. At all events, the evidence at trial afforded no air of
    reality to a verdict of second degree murder. The blood-alcohol concentration
    advanced was not such that it would raise a reasonable doubt about the
    deliberate character of the killing, but not about the underlying intention to
    kill. But what is more is that the exclusion of second degree murder as an
    available verdict was advantageous to Luciano: a reasonable doubt about first
    degree murder would have resulted in a verdict of manslaughter, even if the
    reasonable doubt related only to the requirement of deliberation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart also denies the obligation to
    provide an express instruction that a lesser level of intoxication may raise a
    reasonable doubt about deliberation than is required to create a reasonable doubt
    about proof of the fault or mental element in murder. In every event, this
    common sense conclusion would not be lost on the jury on the basis of the trial
    judge’s final instructions in this case.</span></p>

    the unlawfulness of his conduct that caused Cooper’s death. And the same

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is for you to determine on all of the evidence

    failure of the trial judge to confine this evidence of extrinsic misconduct to
    its legitimate purpose. It was of service to the prosecutor as evidence of
    motive, but nothing more. Critical to its confinement are positive instructions
    about its permitted use and negative instructions about the use to which it
    cannot be put. The instructions should have included an injunction against its
    use as punishment for prior misconduct and a reminder not to be distracted and
    confused by it, thus to lose sight of the real issue in the case.</span></p>

    with the nature of the killing. The error, Mr. Dineen submits, includes both

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    misconduct are both moral and reasoning prejudice. The trier of fact may found
    the conviction on the basis that the accused is a “bad person” who is likely to
    have committed the offence charged. The trier of fact may tend to punish the
    accused for prior misconduct by finding him or her guilty of the offence
    charged. The trier of fact’s attention may be deflected from the main purpose
    of their deliberations, the offence charged, and, once having determined that the
    extrinsic misconduct took place, substitute their decision on it for their

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the evidence of the circumstances
    surrounding the death of Colleen Richardson-Luciano was introduced (at the
    trial for the murder of Cooper) as evidence of motive for Michael Luciano to
    kill James Cooper: to eliminate the sole surviving witness to the killing of
    Colleen. Motive is an item of evidence for jurors to consider, together with
    the rest of the evidence, in deciding whether an accused committed the offence
    charged and did so with the required state of mind: <i>Griffin</i> at paras.
    59-60; <i>Candir</i> at para. 51; <i>Plomp</i> at pp. 243 and 249-50. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the trial judge did instruct the jury,
    in unqualified language, that they were <i>not</i> to infer that Luciano killed
    Cooper merely because they were satisfied that he (Luciano) had killed his
    wife. This instruction inoculated the jurors against the most virulent strain
    of prohibited reasoning, inferring guilt from general propensity. To some
    extent, this instruction enjoining general propensity reasoning takes in some
    of the ground covered by the more specific “no punishment for past sins” or “he
    owes us one” instructions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the failure of the trial judge to say
    everything that could properly be included in a jury instruction is not reversible

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complaint about non-direction here is that
    the trial judge failed to tell the jurors that they should not be confused or
    distracted by the evidence about the killing of Colleen Richardson-Luciano.
    This claim is rooted in the third form of prejudice identified by Sopinka J. in <i>D.(L.E.)</i> as inherent in evidence of similar acts extrinsic to the counts
    contained in an indictment. But it does not follow from the inherent
    prejudicial effect of evidence of similar acts that each of the ways identified
    by Sopinka J. must be converted into a mandatory jury instruction in
    prosecutions that include evidence of extrinsic misconduct. The specific
    warning required by <i>D.(L.E.)</i> is that jurors must <i>not</i> rely on the
    evidence of the extrinsic misconduct as proof that the accused is the sort of
    person who would commit the offences charged, and on that basis, infer his or
    her guilt of the offences charged: <i>D.(L.E.)</i> at pp. 127-28. To say that
    further instruction may be preferable does not make its omission legally wrong: <i>R. v. B.(C.)</i> (2003), 171 C.C.C. (3d) 159 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35.</span></p>

    use the evidence of the propensity or disposition of Luciano and Cooper, in
    particular his characterization of the “type” of homicide involved in the
    killing of Colleen Richardson-Luciano, were, at once, unhelpful and unfocused.
    That said, the complaint that the instructions are contradictory and invite
    speculation elevates them to a status that exceeds any reasonable construction.
    Their purpose was to invite jurors to use their common sense in determining
    whether Luciano or Cooper killed Colleen.</span></p>

    relationship of these instructions to the issues that require decision in this
    case. Michael Luciano admitted that his conduct caused the death of James
    Cooper. The issues for the jury to resolve were whether the prosecutor had
    proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Luciano <i>unlawfully</i> caused the
    death of Cooper and, if he did, whether he committed first degree murder.
    Whether it was Luciano or Cooper who killed Colleen was relevant only to a
    motive to kill Cooper, which was not an essential element of the offence with
    which Luciano was charged.</span></p>

    evidence occupied in the prosecution’s case and collusive conduct among the

    evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, if you do not find that Mr. Luciano killed
    James Cooper because Cooper witnessed Luciano killing Colleen and Luciano
    wanted to get rid of a witness to his deed, then that evidence of motive is not

    judge left a conclusion of fact as potential confirmation, rather than an item

    Elvina Wells’ testimony. And finally, he says, the effect of the instruction

    emphasized the need for <i>independent evidence</i> of motive for the evidence

    has two essential qualities: it must be capable of restoring the faith of the
    trier of fact in relevant aspects of the suspect witness’s account and it must
    be independent, in other words, come from some source other than the suspect
    witness: <i>Khela</i> at paras. 39 and 43. An item of evidence need <i>not</i> implicate the accused to be confirmatory: <i>Khela</i>, at para. 41.</span></p>

    stitched together an account inculpatory of Luciano from threads of
    conversation and conduct contemporaneous with the death of James Cooper. The
    caution recited at length myriad contaminants that nourished the need for
    caution in the jurors’ approach to this evidence. They were told alternatively
    that it was “very dangerous” or “extremely dangerous” to act on this evidence
    on its own, but reminded that they could do so if they were satisfied that the

    killed Cooper to eliminate a witness to Luciano’s killing of his wife, they
    could use “that evidence” as confirmation of Elvina Wells’ account. Failure to
    make the finding left her evidence unconfirmed. The judge concluded his
    instructions in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You may believe Elvina Wells, Marie Bieber and
    Larry Bieber if you find their testimony to be trustworthy, even if no one or
    nothing else confirms it. When you consider it, however, keep in mind how they

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is for you to determine, having regard for the
    opportunity for comparison, collaboration and discussion among themselves,
    whether the evidence has been tainted and, if so, to what degree, if any, it
    has been rendered unreliable. Evidence which you find to be unreliable can
    attract very little weight and it would be very dangerous to form a basis for

    apartment contemporaneously with the killing, including the clean-up and
    disposal of the body, could support a conclusion that it was Luciano who killed
    his wife. And from that, together with the fact that the killing occurred in
    the presence of one eyewitness, Cooper, it would scarcely strain credulity to
    infer that Luciano had a motive to kill Cooper. And independently of anything
    Elvina Wells said about Luciano’s admissions. Evidence of motive may provide
    confirmatory evidence: <i>R. v. Chenier</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 333 (Ont.

    the exclusive responsibility of the jurors to evaluate the evidence and make
    their findings of fact based on that evidence and reasonable inferences drawn

lang=EN-US>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For Luciano, Mr. Dineen contends that the
    “honest witness” instruction is both wrong in law and prejudicial in its
    effect. The law recognizes no such presumption. The prejudice resides in the
    requirement that jurors must cast about for evidence to rebut the presumption
    that each witness is telling the truth. Absent any rebuttal, the instruction
    required jurors to accept the account as the truth. Further, in this case, the
    instruction detracted from the <i>Vetrovec</i> or <i>Vetrovec-</i>like caution
    provided about the evidence of Elvina Wells and Marie and Larry Bieber.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On behalf of the respondent, Mr. Stewart
    acknowledged that the “honest witness” instruction was wrong. But, he says, it
    was harmless error when looked at through the prism of the charge as a whole.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart points out that the instruction
    relates to <i>credibility</i> only, not to both the credibility of a witness
    and the reliability of his or her evidence. Besides, the instruction must not
    be stripped of its surroundings. Those environs included instructions about the
    assessment of evidence, including its reliability and the credibility of the
    witnesses who gave it. Jurors were told repeatedly of their right to believe
    some, none or all of the testimony of any witness who gave evidence of fact or
    of opinion. The <i>Vetrovec </i>or <i>Vetrovec-</i>like instructions in
    connection with the evidence of Elvina Wells and the Biebers urged a cautious
    approach to their testimony. In the end, the instructions, as a whole, more
    than made up for the erroneous reference to the phantom presumption.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The law recognizes no presumption of honesty
    among witnesses summoned to testify in a criminal trial: <i>R. v. Thain</i> (2009),
    243 C.C.C. (3d) 230 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 32.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite the error in the reference to a
    presumption that is unsupported by any authority, I would not order a new trial
    on this ground. My reasons are several. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, critical to a proper evaluation of the
    impact of an admitted error is a functional approach to the instructions as a
    whole, especially other instructions about the credibility of witnesses and the
    reliability of their evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The error appears in the first sentence of a
    paragraph that refers not only to honest witnesses but also to witnesses that
    the jury conclude have lied to them. The passage ends with one of several
    reminders to jurors of their authority to believe all, part or none of the
    evidence of any witness. The trial judge had already given several pages of
    instructions on the exclusive authority of the jurors to determine the facts,
    including their obligation to ignore any judicial opinions about those facts,
    and the use by the jurors of their collective wisdom and common sense in their
    assessment of the evidence. The evidence of several witnesses had been the
    subject of a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution because of evidence of collusion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, as a witness on his own behalf, Michael
    Luciano was the gratuitous beneficiary of the erroneous instruction. Rebuttal
    of the presumption would have the effect of adding to the prosecutor’s burden
    of proof.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, it is by no means clear that the decision
    Luciano invokes to support his claim of fatal error, <i>Thain</i>, supports the
    conclusion he advances.<i> Thain</i> was a trial by judge alone. The trier of
    fact made three errors of which the “honest witness” presumption was one. Two
    related expressly to the evidence of the appellant. One shifted the burden of
    proof. The respondent offered a “strained and generous reading” of the “honest
    witness” reference as an antidote to the prejudice caused by the other errors.
    The argument failed. Sharpe J.A. concluded that the errors committed in the
    credibility assessment were fatal. Put simply, that is not this case.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    brief passage in the charge to the jury about the identity of Colleen
    Richardson-Luciano’s killer. To assess the validity of this claim, a brief

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Instructions of the Trial
    Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During his instructions about motive, the trial
    judge referred to the motive advanced by the prosecutor for the killing of
    Cooper (to eliminate a witness to Luciano’s killing of his wife), then
    continued:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You may reach a verdict based on the theory advanced
    by Crown counsel or on a theory of motive different from that. For example, it
    is open for you to find on the evidence that it was Jimmy Cooper who killed
    Colleen Richardson Luciano on the basis of his antecedents and his propensity
    for violence and to conclude that Mr. Luciano planned and deliberated his
    murder to avenge her death. It is likewise open to you to find on the evidence
    that both Michael Luciano and Jimmy Cooper murdered Colleen together and Mr.
    Luciano planned and deliberated Cooper’s murder to rid himself of a witness.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even though Crown counsel submits to you that his
    theory is the most likely, other factual avenues are open to you. You need not
    all of you arrive at your verdict by the same route. You need not agree on all
    the underlying factors. You need only find that all of the essential elements
    have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and motive is not one of them.
    Motive is not an essential element of the offence of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is for you to decide whether Mr. Luciano had a
    motive such as that theorized by Crown counsel or any motive at all, and how
    much or little you will rely on it to help you decide this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Positions of the Parties on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For Luciano, Mr. Dineen points out that the
    prosecutor never advanced the position at trial that Luciano and Cooper were
    co-principals or joint principals in the killing of Colleen Richardson-Luciano.
    The reference by the trial judge to a joint venture involving the two men
    amounted to the introduction of a new theory or basis of liability without
    notice to Michael Luciano. In the result, Mr. Dineen says, the trial was unfair
    because counsel was unable to respond to this sudden shift in the basis of
    liability.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the respondent, Mr. Stewart submits that the
    reference to which exception is taken was neither erroneous nor unfair. The
    evidence about the circumstances surrounding the death of Colleen
    Richardson-Luciano and what happened afterwards could support an inference of a
    joint venture that resulted in her death. Said in another way, there was
    evidentiary support for a joint principals instruction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart also reminds that a jury is not
    bound to decide a case in accordance with a “theory” advanced by the
    prosecutor, rather must consider whether the evidence proves the essential
    elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. Likewise, the trial judge is
    not bound to instruct the jury only in accordance with the positions advanced
    by the parties. The obligation to instruct derives from the capacity of the
    evidence advanced to establish an air of reality for the instruction. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart acknowledges, as indeed he must,
    that instructions on a new “theory” of liability late in the trial may be
    foreclosed because its introduction would be unfair or would interfere with an
    acccused’s right to control his or her own defence. But no scent of unfairness
    drifted into these proceedings. This instruction was about motive and the
    motive didn’t change with the reference to joint principals. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Governing Principles</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Motive is not part of the definition of murder
    nor an essential element of its classification as first degree murder under s.
    231(2). Evidence of motive is relevant, material and admissible in prosecutions
    for murder, especially where the prosecutor’s case consists of circumstantial
    evidence: <i>R. v. Lewis</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 821, at pp. 837-38. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Evidence of motive is material because it helps
    to establish two essential elements of the prosecution’s proof – identity and
    state of mind: <i>Plomp</i> at pp. 243 and 249-50; <i>Griffin</i> at para. 60; <i>R.
    v. Cloutier</i>, [1940] S.C.R. 131, at p. 135; and <i>Candir</i> at para. 72.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Principles Applied</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This ground of appeal is unavailing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To begin, Michael Luciano does not and could not
    suggest that there was no evidence to justify instruction on joint participation
    in the death of Colleen Richardson-Luciano. Both Luciano and Cooper had
    equivalent opportunity to cause her death. Nothing in the circumstances of her
    death pointed more to one of them than to the other, or indicated that her
    death could only have been caused by a single assailant. What occurred
    thereafter, the clean-up and disposal of her body, was a joint venture. Both
    had argued with her earlier on Friday evening.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the instruction to which objection is
    taken is <i>not</i> one that expands the basis upon which Luciano could be
    found guilty of the offence charged: the first degree murder of James Cooper.
    In other words, this is not a case, like <i>Ranger</i>, where an alternative
    basis of liability was left to the jury in the charge that was incompatible
    with the manner in which the case had been conducted. The instruction in this
    case related to motive: Luciano’s motive to kill Cooper. That motive was to
    eliminate a witness, the only surviving witness, beyond Luciano himself, to the
    killing of his estranged wife. Whether Luciano killed his wife in the presence
    of or with the assistance of Cooper did not alter his motive to kill Cooper.
    The motive to kill Cooper was the same whether Cooper was simply a witness or a
    fellow killer who was also a potential witness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, unlike in <i>Ranger</i> where the
    controversial instruction expanded the basis of Ranger’s liability, the
    instruction here was not concerned with the basis of liability. Luciano
    admitted that his conduct caused Cooper’s death. The issues for the trier of
    fact were whether Luciano had caused Cooper’s death unlawfully and, if so,
    whether Luciano had committed first degree murder. Evidence of motive was
    relevant to each issue, but it was but a single item of evidence for the jury
    to consider.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the brief reference to which exception
    is taken caused no unfairness to Luciano. This was not a game-changer, a
    paradigm shift in the basis of liability that swept away the defence advanced
    at trial or took control of it out of Luciano’s hands. No harm, no foul.</span></p>

    heard evidence that, a few months earlier, Cooper had pulled a knife on a man

    Cooper to avenge Colleen’s death as it was to eliminate a witness. This
    ambiguity or ambivalence rendered its probative value minimal and significantly

lang=EN-US>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge characterized the evidence as
    evidence of after-the-fact or post-offence conduct. He concluded that, because
    the explanations Luciano gave to Elvina revealed a “variety of degrees of
    culpability”, the proposed evidence failed to meet the standard required by <i>R.
    v. Arcangioli, </i>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, thus was inadmissible.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then considered admissibility on
    the assumption that the requirements of <i>Arcangioli</i> had been met. He
    concluded that because the evidence revealed discreditable conduct on Luciano’s
    part, the admissibility decision came down to a balancing of probative value
    and prejudicial effect. He concluded that, in this analysis, prejudicial effect
    prevailed and the evidence should be excluded. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The following passage represents the essence of
    the trial judge’s reasoning:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[35]     My concern is that the introduction of
    this evidence will not lead to a level playing field for both sides in this
    trial.  Rather, it will distort the trial so that the jury will become fixated
    on the death of Jimmy Cooper.  If Michael Luciano is the killer there, with Mr.
    Cooper having been present when Colleen was killed, the jury will not be likely
    to distance themselves  from that evidence in an objective way regardless of
    any instructions given by the trial judge during the trial or at the conclusion
    of the trial.  The Crown’s case can be established by the evidence that it has
    without presenting the evidence about the death of Mr. Cooper.  To add that
    evidence will only go to talking up the Crown’s case in a manner that takes
    away a fair trial.  I’m advised that there will be evidence indicating that Mr.
    Luciano indicated that he was going to kill Mr. Cooper because he killed
    Colleen and at  another time he made a statement that Cooper was a witness.
    That will carry an inference that Michael Luciano killed Colleen
    Richardson-Luciano.  I’m not persuaded that the introduction of the evidence
    regarding the death of Mr. Cooper will be assessed objectively by  the jury.
    Also the jury could become fixated on the killing of Mr. Cooper as proof that
    Mr. Luciano killed Colleen.  It may be said that there are two positions for
    consideration by the jury.  One is that Mr. Luciano killed his wife and then
    killed the witness to that killing.  The other is that Mr. Luciano killed his
    wife’s killer.  Although that presentation is available to the jury, I am 
    persuaded that there is such a high prejudicial impact by this evidence that
    the jury will look at it feeling that they have to choose between one of two
    considerations.  They are more apt to consider Mr. Luciano a bad person who
    killed another. The jury will be sent off on the issues of who killed Mr.
    Cooper when that is not the central issue of this trial.  That being the case,
    this evidence cannot be presented.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[36]      I find that the discreditable conduct of
    killing Jimmy Cooper carries a greater prejudicial impact on the trial than any
    probative value. It forces the jury into moral and reasoning prejudice. I am
    concerned that regardless of any instruction from me both during the trial and
    at the end of the trial, the jury will be enmeshed in thinking that if Michael
    Luciano killed Jimmy Cooper then he is the type of person who would kill his
    wife and further that he must have been the Colleen’s [<i>sic</i>] killer. That
    removes a level playing field because the jury will be preoccupied with the
    death of Jimmy Cooper. When a jury goes off on a tangent as I am concerned that
    they will, they are likely to make the decision on the after-the-fact conduct
    evidence mainly rather than on all of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Conclusion If the Evidence Passes the Principles
    of <i>Arcangioli</i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[37]      On the second consideration of the
    after-the-fact conduct should its introduction not be inadmissible by the
    principles of Arcangioli, the evidence is  too prejudicial to be tendered. Its
    probative value is that it helps to determine the identity of the killer of
    Colleen Richardson-Luciano, but it does so marginally. Its greatest impact is
    that it waives [<i>sic</i>] a red flag at the jury so that they will be prone
    to think of Michael Luciano as a bad person who would likely kill Colleen
    Richardson-Luciano if he was a killer of Jimmy Cooper. The jury will travel
    down that road like a locomotive unable to draw themselves away from being
    consumed with that information. That removes a level playing field. No amount
    of instructions from the trial judge not to do so will succeed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            The Arguments on Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties advanced their positions with
    admirable clarity and commendable brevity. Any inaccuracy in my paraphrase or
    prolixity in their statement is my fault, not theirs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the appellant, Mr. Stewart denies a place
    here for the principles in <i>Arcangioli</i> and its followers. The issue here
    was not the level or degree of Luciano’s culpability, rather the identity of
    Colleen’s killer. Evidence of what happened later can support an inference of
    participation in what occurred earlier. Whether the jurors would draw that inference
    was for them to decide. But they were wrongly denied the chance to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart contends that the evidence was also
    admissible to balance or level the playing field at trial where evidence of
    Cooper’s disposition was to be admitted. The jury was entitled to know that
    there were <i>two</i> persons with a violent disposition with equivalent
    opportunity to kill Colleen Richardson-Luciano, not just one. The evidence also
    tended to blunt Luciano’s explanation for his participation in the clean-up and
    body disposal activities and his fear of Cooper.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart says that the trial judge erred
    further in his assessment of the probative value and prejudicial effect of the
    evidence and his determination that, in the balance, prejudicial effect
    predominated. The trial judge undervalued the probative potential of the
    evidence and overvalued its prejudicial effect. He was unreasonably dismissive
    of the efficacy of limiting instructions. This evidence, given by witnesses who
    would be testifying in any event would neither confuse issues nor distract the
    jurors from the task assigned them at trial. No deference is due his
    assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Stewart advances an alternative argument. He
    submits that, at the very least, the prosecutor should have been permitted to
    adduce evidence that Cooper was dead. Cooper’s absence was the elephant in the
    courtroom at trial. The undertaking of defence counsel to say nothing about
    Cooper’s absence at trial was inadequate in light of the trial judge’s
    instruction that a reasonable doubt could arise from the absence of evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[196]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dineen heads quickly to the bottom line. In
    the end, he submits, the ruling involved the exercise of judicial discretion.
    In determining probative value. In assessing prejudicial effect. In deciding
    where the balance fell. The trial judge did all of this, considered the proper
    factors and reached a conclusion that is entitled to substantial deference.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dineen submits that the evidence about the
    killing of James Cooper had little probative value in helping to establish
    Luciano’s guilt of the murder of his estranged wife. Several explanations may
    underpin the killing of Cooper, thus diminish the probative value of the
    evidence. The trial judge was entitled to reach this conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a similar way, Mr. Dineen says, the trial
    judge was entitled to consider the prejudicial effect of this evidence
    extremely high. The moral prejudice of the evidence is difficult to overstate.
    The evidence, offered at a trial where the issue is the identity of the killer,
    demonstrates that Luciano killed the only other adult present at the first
    killing about 24 hours later. Reasoning prejudice was also substantial. The
    evidence about the killing of Cooper would be lengthy, dominate the trial and
    distract the jurors from their task.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dineen resists the submission that evidence
    about the Cooper killing should have been admitted to respond to the evidence
    about Cooper’s disposition, thus to level the playing field. The prosecutor at
    trial did not take the position that Luciano had put his character in issue,
    thus this line of argument should not be paid any heed here. In every event,
    the final analysis comes down to balancing probative value and prejudicial
    effect with no different result than that recorded by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In response to the alternative ground raised by
    Mr. Stewart, that the prosecutor should have been permitted to adduce evidence
    that Cooper was dead, Mr. Dineen points out that the jurors were not told that
    they could draw any adverse inference from Cooper’s absence. The instruction
    given about a reasonable doubt arising from an absence of evidence is legally
    correct under <i>R. v. Lifchus</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320. And even if the
    evidence had been admitted, the verdict would not have changed.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The only ground of appeal advanced against the
    acquittal has to do with the exclusion of the evidence of the killing of James
    Cooper 24 hours after the killing of Colleen Richardson-Luciano for which
    Luciano was being tried.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[202]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The effect of the trial judge’s ruling was that
    the jury, before whom Cooper was put forward as the real killer of Colleen
    Richardson-Luciano, learned nothing about what had happened to Cooper after he
    arrived with the others at Egmondville on the night after Colleen was killed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue raised can be determined by the
    application of general principles of the law of evidence, not the pigeon-hole
    approach that seems favoured any time the evidence discloses conduct of a party
    after an offence has been committed.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>                        <i>Relevance</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[204]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Relevance is not an inherent characteristic of
    any item of evidence. Relevance exists as a relation between an item of
    evidence proposed for admission and a proposition of fact that the proponent
    seeks to establish by its introduction. Relevance is a matter of everyday
    experience and common sense. Attaching a label like “evidence of after-the-fact
    conduct” or “post-offence conduct” to an item of evidence does not establish
    its relevance. An item of evidence is relevant if it renders the fact it seeks
    to establish slightly more or less probable than it (the fact) would be without
    the evidence, through the application of everyday experience and common sense.</span></p>

    exist in the abstract or in the air: <i>R. v. Cloutier</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R.
    709, at pp. 730-32. An item of evidence does not cease to be relevant or become
    irrelevant because it can support more than one inference: <i> R. v. Underwood </i>(2002),

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[206]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To be relevant, an item of evidence need not
    prove conclusively the proposition of fact for which it is offered, or even
    make that proposition of fact more probable than not. What is essential is that
    the item of evidence must reasonably show, by the application of everyday
    experience and common sense that the fact is slightly more probable with the
    evidence than it would be without it: 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> (6<sup>th</sup> ed.), para. 185, at p. 733.</span></p>

    of evidence must also be material. Evidence is material if what it is offered
    to prove or disprove is a fact in issue. What is in issue is determined by and
    a function of the allegations contained in the indictment and the governing procedural
    and substantive law. If the fact the evidence is offered to prove is not in
    issue, for example because of an admission, the evidence is immaterial: <i>Candir</i> at para. 49.</span></p>

    first determine the issue to which the proposed evidence relates.  After all,
    probative value does not exist in the abstract.  Like relevance, probative
    value is a relative concept to be determined in the context of the case being
    tried: <i>Handy </i>at para. 99; <i>B.(L.)</i>; <i>G.(M.A.)</i>, at para. 23. 
    An assessment of probative value requires consideration of several factors
    including the strength of the proposed evidence, the extent to which the
    proposed evidence supports the inference the prosecutor seeks to have drawn
    from it and the extent to which what the evidence tends to establish is at

    wrongful conviction through an impermissible chain of reasoning – to infer
    guilt from general disposition or propensity: <i>Handy </i>at para. 139. 
    Propensity reasoning uses evidence of character or disposition as
    circumstantial evidence of conduct.  An accused is convicted because of what he
    is, rather than because of what he has done.  Prejudice is a surrogate for

    extrinsic misconduct and the time taken to introduce that evidence, have a
    place in the assessment: <i>Handy </i>at paras. 139-145. Important
    considerations include the extent of the discreditability disclosed by the
    conduct, the extent to which the conduct may support an inference of guilt
    based exclusively on bad character, the extent to which the evidence may
    confuse rather than help to decide issues and the ability of the accused to

    explain both the permitted and prohibited use of the evidence.  And what is
    more, the difficulty encountered by a trial judge in composing limiting
    instructions does not yield a commensurate deficit in adherence to and
    application of them by jurors.  To make too much of the risk of jury misuse of

    law in excluding the evidence that Luciano killed Cooper requires close
    examination of what was proposed for introduction, the grounds upon which the
    case for reception was advanced, and whether the trial judge’s decision
    coincides with or departs from the governing principles.  </span></p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The Proposed Evidence</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[237]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The prosecutor proposed to adduce evidence that
    tended to show that Luciano killed Cooper within about 24 hours after Colleen
    Richardson-Luciano had been stabbed to death in Luciano’s apartment.  The
    proposed evidence, as summarized in the agreed statement of facts filed on the
    admissibility inquiry, was largely, if not entirely, circumstantial.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[238]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The agreed statement of facts contained no
    reference to the defence position at trial, for example that the defence would
    adduce evidence about Cooper’s propensity or disposition for violence in
    support of a claim that Cooper, not Luciano, killed Colleen.  That said, the
    reasons of the trial judge acknowledge at least the prospect that evidence of
    Cooper’s disposition or propensity would be tendered as circumstantial evidence
    of his conduct, thus pointing the finger at Cooper as Colleen’s killer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[239]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made his ruling on admissibility
    at the outset of the trial, before jury selection.  He excluded the proposed
    evidence.  The prosecutor did not renew his application to introduce the
    evidence later in the trial as the evidence supportive of the claim that Cooper
    killed Colleen began to emerge. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:150%'><i><span lang=EN-US>Relevance</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[240]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The excluded evidence supports an inference that
    Luciano killed Cooper.  Evidence of a single violent incident occurring
    contemporaneously with another can support an inference that a person has a
    propensity or disposition for violence: <i>R. v. Yaeck</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C.
    (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 564.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[241]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In paragraph 20 of his reasons, the trial judge
    appears to have concluded that, because the proposed evidence could support
    more than one inference, it had no probative value.  To the extent that this
    finding could be characterized as one involving relevance, it is wrong. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[242]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Individual items of circumstantial evidence
    often give rise to competing or different inferences.  That they do so is at
    once the very essence of circumstantial evidence and does not mean that they
    are or can be written off as irrelevant.  To require that the inference for
    which the evidence is offered be the only inference available from the evidence
    would pose a standard of conclusiveness that very few items of circumstantial
    evidence could meet.  Such a requirement confuses weight with relevance. 
    Provided the inference advanced is one that is reasonably available on the
    evidence, the proponent has established that the evidence is relevant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[243]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the trial judge characterized the
    proposed evidence as evidence of “after-the-fact conduct” and applied the principles
    discussed in <i>Arcangioli.</i>  Characterization of the proposed evidence as
    evidence of “after-the-fact conduct” tends to obscure the analysis, risking the

    killed Cooper at Luciano’s trial for the murder of Colleen is not governed by <i>Arcangioli</i>.

lang=EN-US>[252]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To support his claim that Cooper killed Colleen,

    disposition for violence.  The purpose of this propensity evidence was to
    invite the jury to have a reasonable doubt about Luciano’s guilt because
    Cooper’s violent tendencies rendered him more likely to be Colleen’s killer
    than Luciano, her estranged husband.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[253]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The probative value of the proposed evidence
    rested in its capacity to demonstrate Luciano’s disposition or propensity to
    violence, thus to show that there were two people, not just one, of similar
    disposition with equivalent opportunity to kill Colleen: <i>McMillan</i> at p. 767.
    It was evidence of a single incident of significant and contemporaneous
    violence offered to establish propensity.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[254]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was invited by the prosecutor to
    rule on the admissibility of the proposed evidence before the jury was
    selected. The governing admissibility rule required the trial judge to assess
    the probative value of the evidence. The trial judge considered the apparent
    strength of the evidence and its ability to support the inference advanced
    (that Luciano also had a disposition for violence), as well as whether what it tended
    to show was at issue at trial.  The Crown has not demonstrated any legal error
    in this assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[255]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Evidence that Luciano killed Cooper is
    inherently prejudicial. The conduct is discreditable of Luciano, perhaps even
    more so than the killing charged because of evidence that the killing of Cooper
    was planned and deliberate. The evidence invokes propensity reasoning and may
    enhance the risk of an unfocused trial by diverting the jurors attention from
    the crucial issue of the identity of Colleen’s killer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[256]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Introduction of evidence about the killing of

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    permitting introduction of evidence about the killing of Cooper, as well as in
    deciding where the balance between probative value and prejudicial effect fell,
    the trial judge was required to consider the effect of limiting instructions in
    curbing both moral and reasoning prejudice. The reasons of the trial judge make
    it clear that he considered limiting instructions <i>incapable</i> of
    curtailing the prejudicial effect of the evidence.</span></p>

    interpretation that he may have reasoned from a premise of presumptive evidentiary
    misuse despite limiting instructions. To reason in this way is to turn the
    presumptive efficacy of limiting instructions and jury adherence to those
    instructions on its head: <i>Corbett </i>at pp. 695-696; <i>Sauvé</i> at paras.
    88-89; and <i>Griffin</i> at paras. 71-74. An error in the assessment of the prejudicial

    can the Attorney General succeed on an appeal from an acquittal on the basis of
    some abstract or purely hypothetical possibility that an accused would have
    been convicted were it not for the error of law.  Something more is required. 
    And that something more is to satisfy the appellate court that the error might
    reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case, to have had a

    between the legal error and the verdict rendered (an acquittal).  The
    authorities teach that acquittals are not to be overturned lightly.  The

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[262]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, whether the trial judge erred in his
    determination of the prejudicial effect of the proposed evidence, thus in his
    decision about whether the balance of probative value and prejudicial effect
    favored admission or exclusion, is not entirely clear. If, in his assessment of
    prejudicial effect, the trial judge proceeded from the premise that jurors were <i>incapable</i> of following complex legal instructions involving evidence of
    limited admissibility, he was wrong.  The presumption is to the contrary.  But
    it was open to the trial judge to conclude, notwithstanding the presumption,
    that the limiting instructions required <i>in this case</i>, in light of the
    evidence to be adduced, would not be adequate to overcome the prejudicial
    effect of the evidence so that probative value would predominate.  Said in
    another way, it is far from clear that this admissibility ruling, made in an
    evidentiary desert before jury selection, would have been different had the
    trial judge started with the presumption that jurors follow limiting
    instructions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[263]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the principal basis of admissibility
    advanced on appeal, that the evidence was admissible to respond to the evidence
    of Cooper’s disposition for violence, was not the basis upon which the case for
    admissibility was advanced at trial.  The prosecutor at trial considered that
    the evidence was “likely inadmissible” on the primary ground now advanced, thus
    did not seek its admission on this ground.  New theories of admissibility
    advanced by the Crown should garner no more appellate approval than new
    theories of liability.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[264]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the prosecutor never renewed the
    application made at the outset of the trial to have the evidence of Luciano’s
    disposition admitted after the full extent of the “Cooper as killer” evidence
    unfolded. Although the pre-trial ruling was based on the premise that evidence
    of Cooper’s disposition for violence <i>would</i> be adduced at trial, it was
    open to the prosecutor to renew the application when the full extent of the
    evidence was revealed.  See, by analogy, <i>R. v. Underwood</i>, [1998] 1
    S.C.R. 77, at para. 11.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[265]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, admissibility in this case depended
    upon an assessment of probative value, prejudicial effect, and of where the
    balance fell between them.  These assessments are notoriously fact-specific.
    Absent clear error, these decisions should rest with their primary constituency
    – the trial judge: <i>Shearing</i> at para. 73.</span></p>
