    at the trial in 2007.  L.T. testified that the appellant, who was her
    stepfather, began sexually abusing her when she was eight or nine years of
    age.  The abuse continued until she was fourteen.  The appellant lived with
    L.T. and her mother during most of the time period during which L.T. alleged
    abuse.  </span></p>

    including the appellant touching her chest and genital areas, oral sex, and one
    act of sexual intercourse.  L.T. said she was not good at remembering specific
    times and dates, but placed the abuse in time relative to where she lived over
    the years.  </span></p>

    summer camp in 2005 during a group discussion about families.  The following month,
    she made a video statement to the police describing the abuse.  She adopted the
    contents of the video statement at trial.</span></p>

    L.T. repeatedly denied that the appellant had abused her.  She denied the abuse
    to her aunt, her mother, a worker from the Childrens Aid Society, and to a
    lawyer who was defending the appellant on charges of sexual abuse laid by the
    aunt.</span></p>

    assaulting L.T.s aunt during a time period included in the range over which L.T.
    subsequently alleged abuse.  L.T. told the appellants lawyer that the appellant
    had not abused her.  She agreed to testify to help the appellant at his trial. 
    The charges against the appellant with respect to the aunt were eventually withdrawn
    at the request of the Crown. </span></p>

    about the abuse before 2005 because she was ashamed, because she feared
    breaking the family apart, and also because the appellant had told her not to
    tell anyone.</span></p>

    described a few incidents involving the appellant and L.T. that she viewed as
    suspicious only with the benefit of hindsight.  She explained her non-intervention
    at the time of the incidents as being a result of her schizophrenia or the fact
    that she trusted the appellant.</span></p>

    denied abuse.  She concocted the allegations against the appellant in 2005 at
    the urging of and in order to assist her aunt.  L.T.s mother was also involved

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence
    in the form of an audio tape.  He submits that the recording shows that L.T.s
    aunt and mother colluded to fabricate false allegations of sexual abuse against
    the appellant in the past.  This, he argues, supports his position that the
    mothers testimony in this case is unreliable and therefore cannot be used to
    support L.T.s allegations. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The only evidence with respect to the origin of
    the audio tape comes from the appellant.  In his affidavit on the fresh
    evidence motion, the appellant said the tape was made on June 4, 2003 after his
    arrest on the charge of sexually assaulting L.T.s aunt.  On cross-examination,
    he conceded that the arrest stemming from the aunts charge had happened over a
    year before the tape was recorded, and that the recording had actually happened
    on the day of his arrest on other charges.  The appellants purpose was to
    record an incriminating telephone conversation between L.T.s mother and her
    aunt when he believed they were plotting against him.  He was not present at
    the time the conversations on the tape were recorded.</span></p>

    some members of her family, including possibly L.T.s aunt.  The voice, which
    the appellant says is that of L.T.s mother, is speaking in Mandarin.  The
    appellant takes the position that the relevant part shows that L.T.s mother is
    conspiring with the unheard persons on the other end of the conversation about
    the time frame during which L.T.s aunt could claim that the appellant sexually
    assaulted her.  It also includes details L.T.s aunt could include in her
    allegations concerning certain identifying marks near the appellants genitals.</span></p>

    different friend of the appellants delivered two tapes to the appellants
    trial counsel at the courthouse.  Counsel reviewed the tapes with a Mandarin
    interpreter, came to the conclusion that there was nothing relevant on them,
    and therefore took no steps to ask that the case be reopened.</span></p>

    the appellant had told him about a tape in January of 2007.  The appellant had
    told him that it was, in effect, a smoking gun.  Trial counsel said he had
    asked the appellant for the tape during the period leading up to trial but
    nothing materialized until May 16.  In his evidence on the fresh evidence
    motion, the appellant said that he had not discussed the tape with his trial
    counsel before May 16.</span></p>

    evidence on appeal is set out in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.  To
    be admitted, the appellant must show that the evidence (1) could not have been
    obtained by due diligence before the trial (though this is not always required
    in the criminal context); (2) is relevant to a decisive or potentially decisive
    issue; (3) is reasonably capable of belief; and (4) if believed, could
    reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
    have affected the result.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant accepts that the tape could have
    been discovered by reasonable diligence before trial.  He says, however, that
    the lack of diligence should not govern the fresh evidence analysis because it is
    explained by trial counsels incompetence.  He also argues that the failure to
    exercise due diligence should give way to the importance of the tape to the
    result at trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that, if admitted, the tape
    could be used to impeach L.T.s mother by showing that she was involved in an
    earlier conspiracy to wrongly accuse the appellant of sexual assault.  As a
    result, the appellant argues, a court would reject the mothers evidence
    thereby removing any confirmatory evidence with respect to L.T.s complaints of
    abuse.  Thus, the tape could have affected the result at trial.</span></p>

    In my view, the evidence does not meet the fourth <i>Palmer</i> criterion.  The
    appellant has not established that, if believed, the tape and the appellants
    evidence relating to it, could reasonably be expected to have affected the
    result of the case against him.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Importantly, the tape does not undermine L.T.s
    credibility.  It does not relate to L.T.s complaints of sexual abuse.  According
    to the appellant, the tape was made over two years before L.T. first complained
    of abuse.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The tape also does not support an argument that
    L.T.s evidence was part of a conspiracy with her mother to frame the
    appellant.  Significantly, there was evidence that when the Childrens Aid
    Society apprehended L.T. on September 6, 2005, L.T.s mother was supportive of
    the appellant, not L.T. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At best, the tape could have been used to
    cross-examine L.T.s mother and possibly undermine her credibility on the basis
    of an argument that if she conspired in 2003 to frame the appellant on the aunts
    charges, her evidence in L.T.s trial should have been suspect.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are two difficulties with this argument.  First,
    the meaning of the conversation on the tape is not clear.  While it may be
    capable of the sinister interpretation urged by the appellant, it is also open
    to a more benign explanation.  It is difficult to know what the impact, if any,
    of cross-examining L.T.s mother on the tape would have been.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, it is not apparent that the trial judge
    relied upon L.T.s mothers evidence in convicting the appellant.  The trial
    judge discussed the mothers evidence and noted that she had testified about
    some examples of nudity and sexual impropriety.  However, the trial judge
    recognized that there were problems with the mothers evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Importantly, the trial judge made strong and

    alleges that trial counsels incompetence impacted the reliability of the
    result, the appellant must show that there is a reasonable probability that the
    appellant would not have been convicted but for the incompetence.  Put another
    way, a reviewing court must be satisfied that the verdict cannot be taken as a

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(a)       The Audio Tape</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that his trial counsel was
    incompetent in the way he addressed the audio tape.  In particular, he alleges
    incompetence because trial counsel (1) failed to take steps to obtain the tape
    before the trial; (2) failed to discuss the content of the tape with the
    appellant after he received it; and (3) failed to apply to re-open the case to
    use the tape at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am not satisfied that the appellant has met
    the ineffective assistance test with respect to the tape.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept that counsels conduct fell
    below the reasonableness standard in respect of his effort to obtain the tape
    before the trial began.  On trial counsels evidence, the appellant told him
    about the tape approximately four months before the trial.  Counsel
    subsequently asked the appellant for the tape, but the appellant did nothing.  The
    tape only materialized after the appellant called his friend to ask that it be
    delivered to trial counsel.  It is unclear what else counsel could have done to
    expedite this process. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am concerned somewhat that once counsel
    received two tapes on May 16, he did not ask the court for time to review them
    with the appellant.  While it was obviously late in the day, such a request
    would have been appropriate and may have led to an application to re-open the
    case to further cross-examine L.T.s mother on the basis of the relevant part
    of one of the tapes.  However, it is by no means clear to me that the appellant
    would have been permitted to have the case re-opened.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, I do not find it necessary to
    decide whether or not trial counsels handling of the tape on May 16
    constituted ineffective assistance.  Assuming the trial judge had permitted the
    case to be re-opened and counsel to cross-examine L.T.s mother on the tape, I
    do not think there was a reasonable probability that the result at trial would
    have been any different.</span></p>

    reasoned that the allegation was demonstrably false because it was incredible
    that the teachers would have done nothing if they had seen what L.T.
    described.  Trial counsel concluded that his cross-examination could have a devastating
    effect on L.T.s overall credibility.</span></p>

    collateral matter.  It had nothing to do with L.T.s allegations against the
    appellant nor did it show a pattern of conduct by L.T. of bringing forward
    false claims about sexual abuse.  She did not complain about the incident until
    she mentioned it at the end of her statement to the police in September 2005.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Clearly, trial counsel thought about the issue
    with some care.  He considered this courts decision in <i>R. v. Riley</i> (1992),
    11 O.R. (3d) 151, and determined he had a basis to cross-examine L.T. about the
    collateral incident.  He decided that the best way to approach the issue was to
    have L.T. adopt the almost raped statement as true and then show that what
    she said was incredible.  In closing argument, he would submit that L.T. had
    lied or seriously exaggerated the incident and was therefore not a credible
    witness.  </span></p>

    counsel with respect to the almost raped issue is answered by what Doherty
    J.A. said in <i>Joanisse</i>.  At p. 61, he pointed out that the reasonableness
    of counsels performance must be measured in the particular circumstances of
    the case at the point in time when counsel acted.  He said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The wisdom of hindsight has no
    place in this assessment.  This approach also recognizes that in many
    situations counsel will have a wide range of options any of which, if taken,
    will constitute competent representation.  Appellate courts must give deference
    to the choices made by counsel and the competence assessment must be informed
    by a perception in favour of competence.</span></p>

    reasonable.  While he may have been overly optimistic about the potential impact
    of his cross-examination, I do not think that his decision not to investigate
    the incident before trial was unreasonable.  To the extent there was anything to
    be made of the incident, the simple approach adopted by trial counsel of having
    L.T. confirm the allegation, including the surrounding circumstances, and arguing
    that her description was incredible was a reasonable strategy.</span></p>

    when asked to review counsels performance during a cross-examination.  Cross-examination
    is often referred to as an art, for good reason.  While careful preparation is
    no doubt essential, counsel are frequently required to make judgments in the
    moment about how to word the next question and whether to pursue an issue or
    leave it alone.  In making decisions, counsel must be alive to the language
    used by the witness, the content of the answer, a witness demeanour, the
    likelihood of what the witness may say in response, and, importantly, the
    impact on the trier of fact of what has come out to that point and what may yet
    come out.  Successful cross-examiners may adopt different approaches to similar
    situations.  Frequently, there is not one correct way to cross-examine a
    witness on a particular point.  </span></p>

    informed trial counsel that he had some unusual characteristics in relation to
    his genitalia, including not being circumcised and having odd coloured pubic
    hair and a scar near his testicles.  The appellant wanted trial counsel to
    cross-examine L.T. about whether she had seen any of these unusual
    characteristics during the alleged sexual abuse.</span></p>

    what the appellant had told him.  He did not cross-examine L.T. about the
    appearance of the appellants genitalia and closed his cross-examination. 
    During the ensuing break, the appellant reminded counsel about this matter.</span></p>

    the court to assist him in making arrangements for counsel to go to the court
    cells to take a photograph of the appellants genitals.  On examination in the
    cells, trial counsel concluded there was nothing remarkable about the appellants
    appearance.  Nonetheless, he had a photograph taken.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once back in court, trial counsel told the court
    that there was nothing there and chalked the incident up to a misunderstanding
    on his part.  He did not produce the photograph.  In his evidence with respect
    to the incompetent counsel allegation, trial counsel conceded that when he came
    back to court empty-handed he was trying to do damage control.  He went on to
    opine that the series of events did incalculable damage to [the appellants]
    defence.  Counsel said he discerned a look of disdain on the trial judges
    face when he told the trial judge there was nothing there.  Counsel thought
    that that the incident helped get [the appellant] convicted.  He accepted that
    he was partially responsible for the disaster.</span></p>

    issue fell below the standard of reasonableness.  He should have made sure of
    his footing before starting down the path of cross-examining L.T.  It was
    apparent that the issue could turn out poorly, as it did.</span></p>

    the photograph, he told the trial judge there was nothing there and that there
    had been a misunderstanding on his part.  In effect, counsel took the fall. 
    The trial judge recognized that the episode could be problematic.  He addressed
    it immediately.  He said: It appears it [the photograph] has no relevance
    because the purpose of taking the picture, as I understand, was to cast some
    doubt on the evidence of the complainant.  He concluded by saying: We will
    eliminate the consideration of the photograph and consider it to be a non-issue. </span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(d)       The Decision Not to Testify</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that trial counsel also
    provided ineffective assistance in advising him that he need not testify at
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant argues that trial counsel
    vastly over-estimated the effect of his cross-examination of L.T. with respect
    to the almost raped incident and that this erroneous assessment led him to
    encourage the appellant not to testify.  Trial counsel was of the opinion that
    his cross-examination was so successful that the trial judge was unlikely to
    convict on the basis of L.T.s evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept this argument.  No doubt trial
    counsels assessment of the impact of his cross-examination on the almost raped
    issue was overly optimistic.  The trial judge paid little heed to this evidence
    in assessing L.T.s credibility.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, even if counsel had not misjudged the
    impact of the almost raped evidence, it was most unlikely that he would have
    advised the appellant differently about whether to testify.  Prior to the
    trial, counsel discussed with the appellant whether he would give evidence.  Counsel
    had formed the opinion that the appellant would make a terrible witness.  In
    his discussions with the appellant, counsel observed that the appellant was
    unable to answer questions clearly, that he would go off in tangents and that
    he was the classic non-responsive witness.  Counsel gave the appellant his
    opinion.  The appellant decided that he would not testify.  As a result, the
    appellant re-elected trial by judge alone.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At most, trial counsels assessment of L.T.s
    evidence regarding the almost raped incident simply served to confirm the
    wisdom of a decision that the appellant had already made  he would not
    testify.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also says that his decision not to
    give evidence was affected by the events surrounding the photograph.  The
    concern, he argues, was that if he gave evidence, he would have been confronted
    with those events and his credibility undermined.  Be that as it may, at best,
    the photograph incident only confirmed a decision that had already been made.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary, I would not interfere with the
    judgment on the basis of the ineffective assistance of counsel arguments.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Issue #3: The Adequacy of the Interpretation Services</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant required the assistance of a
    Mandarin interpreter at trial.  He seeks to have fresh evidence admitted with a
    view to establishing that the interpretation services provided at trial were
    inadequate and breached his s. 14 <i>Charter</i> rights.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The fresh evidence is found in two affidavits of
    the appellant and in the cross-examination on those affidavits.  The appellant
    alleges that he could not understand parts of the evidence at trial.  Some of
    the interpreters had accents that he could not understand and some of the
    interpreters were unable to keep up with the speed of the proceedings.  As a
    result, he argues that his rights to be present at trial and have the
    proceedings interpreted were breached.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not admit the fresh evidence.  The
    appellants argument that his s. 14 <i>Charter</i> rights were breached has no

lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants evidence about his inability to
    understand the interpreters lacks credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant never mentioned anything about the
    alleged interpretation problems to his lawyer or to the court during the trial. 
    The appellants trial counsel testified that the appellant did not mention any
    difficulties and that he, the counsel, was satisfied that the appellant
    understood the proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am also satisfied that the appellant never
    told any of the interpreters that he was having trouble understanding them. 
    While his proposed fresh evidence is somewhat inconsistent on this point, it is
    significant that none of the interpreters reported to the court that the
    appellant was having difficulty.  Moreover, the trial transcript reveals that
    on occasion interpreters spoke up if they were having difficulty in
    interpreting the evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Most tellingly, when during the sentencing
    hearing a Cantonese interpreter attended whom the appellant did not understand,
    the appellant told the judge in English that he could not understand.  It is
    hard to imagine that the appellant would not tell his lawyer, the judge or an
    interpreter on other occasions if he had had the same problem.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, in respect of the interpretation services
    at trial, the appellant submits that he may not have been present when two of
    the interpreters were sworn.  He argues that this breached his right to be
    present at his trial pursuant to s. 650 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I have reviewed the relevant part of the
    transcript.  While it is not entirely clear, I think the better view is that
    the appellant was present when the interpreters were sworn.  Moreover, the
    appellant has not sought to introduce fresh evidence indicating that he was not
    present at the time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this argument.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the trial judges
    reasons were insufficient for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, he says it was incumbent on the trial
    judge to reconcile the doubt he had with respect to the counts on which he
    acquitted with his findings of guilt on the other counts.  I do not accept this
    argument.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judges doubt with respect to the two
    counts related to whether the offences occurred within the time set out in
    those counts.  His doubt was not based on a concern that L.T. was not telling
    the truth about her memories of the sexual abuse.  Throughout his reasons, the
    trial judge made it clear that he found L.T. to be an honest witness.  In her
    evidence, L.T. said she could not be sure about times and dates.  The trial
    judge found that this weakness was understandable in view of the long period of
    time before she disclosed the abuse.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That the alibi evidence left the trial judge
    with reasonable doubt about the accuracy of L.T.s testimony concerning the
    dates of two counts did not preclude him from finding reliable the allegations
    corresponding to the other counts for which there was no alibi evidence.  That
    finding was open to him.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Next, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in failing to adequately address the inconsistency in L.T.s evidence
    regarding the nature of abuse that occurred at the Dunn Avenue residence.  The
    trial judge was alive to this issue and took into consideration the
    inconsistency in his overall assessment of L.T.s credibility.  I see no error.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred

    two facts.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not agree.  First, the trial judge
    commented that the reasons L.T. gave for delays in reporting the abuse were the
    very reasons why young victims of parental abuse do not complain.  L.T. had
    testified that she did not report the abuse for several years because she was
    concerned about the family break-up, she was ashamed and the appellant told her
    not to.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before making this comment, the trial judge had
    quoted extensively from the Supreme Court of Canadas decision in <i>R. v. D.D.</i>,<i> </i>2000 SCC 43, 148 C.C.C. (3d) 41.  In that decision, the Supreme Court
    referred to the same three factors as L.T. as reasons why young people delay in
    reporting sexual abuse.  The trial judges comment flowed directly from that
    case.  Moreover, the trial judge did not use L.T.s reasons for delay as
    confirmatory or supporting evidence.  Rather, he concluded only that those
    reasons were a neutral factor explaining the delay.  He was entitled to take
    that approach.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge erred when he observed that L.T.s poor marks in school were a classic
    symptom of parental sexual abuse.  The trial judges comment was made as an
    aside in the course of his discussion about why L.T. had not complained of the
    abuse, not as a reason for finding L.T. credible.  I see no error.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge attached too much weight to L.T.s demeanour in accepting her evidence. 
    In one instance, he said her credibility is established by her demeanour. 
    While the use of the word establish, taken alone, may indicate an
    over-emphasis on demeanour, the trial judges reasons read as a whole disclose consideration
    of all the appropriate factors in his assessment of L.T.s credibility.  The
    trial judge set out in some detail the arguments of the defence that challenged
    her credibility and addressed them.  He found her evidence to be
    straightforward and clear.</span></p>
