  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The three applicants, the
    Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), the British Columbia Civil
    Liberties Association (BCCLA) and jointly the Canadian AIDS Society, the
    HIV/AIDS Legal Network and the HIV &amp; AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario (HIV/AIDS
    Applicants) seek to intervene in this appeal. The appellant/Crown opposes their
    intervention. The respondent consents to their intervention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The respondent was charged
    with cultivating marihuana, contrary to the <em>Controlled Drug and Substances
    Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, S.C. 1996, c. 19</span></em> (CDSA). At trial, the respondent challenged the <i>Marihuana Medical Access
    Regulations</i>, S.O.R./ 2001-227 (MMAR) on the basis they are illusory for
    many Canadians because doctors will not sign the declaration required under the
    MMAR for reasons unrelated to the therapeutic advantages or disadvantages of
    medicinal marihuana.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The trial judge declared the
    MMAR and the prohibitions against possession and production of cannabis
    (marihuana) in ss. 4 and 7 of the CDSA constitutionally invalid and of no force
    and effect. The charge against the respondent was permanently stayed. The trial
    judge’s decision was based on findings that the evidence had established that
    it was practically impossible to obtain the requisite support of a medical
    doctor for the lawful use of medicinal marihuana under the MMAR. He found that
    the physicians in Canada had massively boycotted the MMAR, and that their
    overwhelming refusal to participate in the medicinal marihuana program
    completely undermined the effectiveness of the program.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals primarily
    on the basis that the trial judge made three fundamental errors, by:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. misunderstanding the effects of the 2005 overhaul of the
    MMARs and basing his ruling on what was required of doctors by the pre-2005
    scheme, not the present system; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. making serious mathematical errors leading him to
    misunderstand and mischaracterize the functioning of the impugned scheme; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. finding or assuming that the exemption-seekers in this case
    were (a) all entitled to a medical exemption and (b) had taken reasonable steps
    to complete the presently required application when there was no evidentiary
    basis for those findings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>I start with the arguments
    the applicants will make if granted standing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The HIV/AIDS Applicants will
    argue that the issues raised by this appeal go well beyond this individual
    case. When viewed in a broad context this case has implications for many
    Canadians. They argue that they directly represent thousands of people who
    suffer from conditions for which the medicinal use of marihuana is beneficial,
    and on that basis alone they qualify as persons affected by the decision under
    appeal: see <em>Bedford v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2009 ONCA 669, 98
    O.R. (3d) 792, at para. 2. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>In any event, the HIV/AIDS
    Applicants say that they also have a useful contribution to make to assist in
    the resolution of the appeal without causing any injustice to the parties. Their
    argument will be based solely on the record in this case. They will not seek to
    provide additional factual evidence or introduce fresh evidence. Their position
    is that doctors’ decisions in this context are subject to the <i>Canadian <em>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</em></i> and that the evidence in this case, at a
    minimum, shows a strong reluctance by doctors to participate in the MMAR
    process. Thus they argue that the MMAR scheme is arbitrary and in violation of s.
    7 of the <em>Charter</em> because there is no realistic possibility of legal
    review of the doctors’ decisions. They argue that there is no alternative for
    people to legitimately use marihuana for medicinal purposes, other than to go
    from one doctor to the next until they find one who is willing to participate
    in the process. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The HIV/AIDS Applicants also
    argue that even if the Crown were successful in his arguments with respect to
    the one respondent in this case, the record, supplemented by their arguments, can
    sustain a finding of a <i>Charter </i>breach. In this way they differentiate
    their position from the respondent’s presumed position to simply argue in favour
    of upholding the trial judge’s findings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The BCCLA indicates that it will
    make submissions on the appropriate remedy in this case for persons in the
    respondent’s position. Persons who have a legitimate basis for the use of
    medicinal marihuana, but cannot obtain an exemption. The BCCLA will not seek to
    add anything to the record. On the record as established at trial, they will
    submit that a violation of the <em>Charter</em> has been made out in the
    respondent’s case, as would be the case for many other people in similar circumstances.
    The BCCLA also wishes to offer a different interpretation of the case law in
    this area than the appellant has argued, which has broad implications for
    Canadians. They say they have an interest in offering this alternative
    interpretation, which is not shared by the appellant or the respondent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is the case with the other two applicants, the CCLA indicates that it will not
    seek to add to the record in this appeal. If the trial judge’s findings are
    upheld in this court, the CCLA wishes to suggest alternative legal mechanisms
    for the medicinal use of marihuana. These alternatives will be based on regimes
    in other jurisdictions and aim to assist in this court’s consideration of what
    would be an appropriate regime. On the other hand, the CCLA provides a
    position, not put forward by the respondent, if this court is persuaded that
    the trial judge’s findings, particularly about physicians in Canada having
    massively boycotted the MMAR, are in error. The CCLA’s position is that it would
    be unreasonable to require an individual to establish a massive boycott of the
    MMAR scheme in order to establish a <em>Charter</em> violation. The CCLA
    proposes to offer a test and the relevant factors for courts to consider in
    this context.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the applicants propose to make any submissions with respect to whether the trial
    judge made factual errors or not. The HIV/AIDS Applicants will rely on
    legislative facts, as is often the case in constitutional cases. They rely on
    these facts primarily to argue that there are inconsistencies between some of
    the Crown’s positions in this appeal and those legislative facts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While
    the Crown fairly concedes that the applicants all have an interest in the
    issues raised in this appeal, the Crown contends that this is a focused, fact
    based appeal applying settled legal principles, and is thus an inapt case for
    public-interest interventions. The Crown argues that the interveners are in no
    better position than the respondent to argue the factual issues at the core of
    this appeal. The Crown also submits that the broader proposed submissions
    raised by the applicants were not argued at trial, are not supported by the
    factual record in this case, are duplicative as between them, and in the case
    of the BCCLA and the HIV/AIDS Applicants, are prejudicial to the Crown and
    third parties not before the courts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown emphasizes that the record in this case does not include any direct
    evidence from doctors and evidence about what patients were told by their
    doctors was ruled admissible only for the fact that those statements were made,
    and not for the truth of their content. The Crown says that the implication
    that doctors were either refusing to assist their patients for non-medical
    reasons or because they were wrong about the benefits of marihuana for their
    patients is highly prejudicial and problematic, and that neither of these
    positions is established in the evidence and therefore cannot be relied upon by
    the applicants.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there may be some inevitable overlap among the applicants, I am satisfied that
    each applicant has distinct arguments from the others and I accept counsel’s
    submissions that they will avoid any unnecessary repetition. Having heard what
    the applicants propose to argue, I do not accept the Crown’s submission that
    this is simply a fact-based appeal. The applicants propose to make their
    arguments on the evidentiary record before the court. They do not propose to
    address or defend the reasonableness of the factual findings made by the trial
    judge. They leave that to the respondent. Rather the applicants propose to
    address broader legal and constitutional issues based on alternative factual
    findings that could emerge from this factual record. Those types of submissions
    could be helpful to the court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    the intervention is in the context of a <i>Charter </i>case, whether an
    intervener has an important perspective distinct from the immediate parties is
    an important factor to consider on such applications: <i>Ontario (Attorney
    General) v. Dieleman </i>(1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 32. Whether or not the
    applicants’ positions ultimately prevail, they will still provide a unique
    viewpoint that will not otherwise be made and which may be useful to the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Chief Justice Dubin stated in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic
    &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada</i> <span style='color:windowtext'>(1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 164</span>,
    at p. 167:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Although much has been written as to the
    proper matters to be considered in determining whether an application for
    intervention should be granted, in the end, in my opinion, the matters to be
    considered are the nature of the case, the issues which arise and the
    likelihood of the applicant being able to make a useful contribution to the
    resolution of the appeal without causing injustice to the immediate parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also do not accept that allowing the applicants to intervene will unfairly
    prejudice the medical profession.  As I say, the applicants will take the
    record as it is.  If there is prejudice to the medical profession in that
    record, which is far from obvious to me, it is there now and will not result
    from permitting these interventions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also do not accept that permitting the interventions will unfairly prejudice
    the Crown. The issues that the applicants propose to raise are not surprising
    and emerge quite naturally in a constitutional case such as this.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus
    I am also of the view that each of the applicants should be able to make a
    useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing an
    injustice to the appellant or prejudicing the appeal process.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this basis I grant the applications to intervene.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am mindful of the Crown’s alternative submission that, if I were inclined to
    grant the applications, the aggregate of the interventions should not outweigh
