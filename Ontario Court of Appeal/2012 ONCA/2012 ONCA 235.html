  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Ernest Marsig, signed a guarantee that was
    included within a registered mortgage document. The mortgage went into default,
    and the mortgagee, the Equitable Trust Company, exercised its power of sale.
    There was a deficiency, and Equitable Trust sued Mr. Marsig (and his co-guarantor)
    on the guarantee. Mr. Marsig moved for summary judgment dismissing the action,
    and he submitted that the action on his guarantee was statute-barred under s. 5
    of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B. His principal
    argument was that the guarantee was a demand obligation and that all demand
    obligations are subject to the two-year limitation period prescribed by the
    Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice Ramsay dismissed the motion. He held that the guarantee
    was not a demand obligation and that the applicable limitation period was the
    ten-year period provided for under s. 43 of the <em>Real Property Limitations
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Marsig appeals on the basis that the judgment below was in
    error. I disagree and I would dismiss the appeal.    </p>
  <h1 style='line-height:115%'><span lang=X-NONE>B.<span

lang=X-NONE>FACTUAL BACKGROUND </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> By a mortgage commitment letter dated December 20, 2004, First
    National Financial Corporation agreed to lend $1,347,281 to a corporation to be
    formed. Under the commitment, Ernest Marsig and Isle Griegl-Schott agreed to
    guarantee the mortgage loan. It was a term of the commitment that the loan
    would include mortgage insurance from the Canadian Mortgage Housing Corporation
    (CMHC). Before the advance of funds, First National assigned the commitment to
    Equitable Trust.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On February 9, 2005, a charge from 2062277 Ontario Inc.
    encumbering a property municipally known as 190 Thames Street, Chatham, Ontario
    was registered in favour of Equitable Trust. Mr. Marsig and Ms. Griegl-Schott
    signed the mortgage on behalf of the numbered corporation. They also signed in
    their personal capacity as “guarantors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>2062277 Ontario Inc. defaulted on payment of the loan, and on
    December 7, 2007, Equitable Trust issued a notice of sale under mortgage. The
    notice was served on Mr. Marsig.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On June 28, 2010, the property was sold under the power of sale,
    but there was a deficiency. Thus, on September 17, 2010, Equitable Trust
    commenced an action against 2062277 Ontario Inc., Mr. Marsig, and others for
    payment of the deficiency.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It should be noted that the December 2007 notice of sale under
    mortgage was a demand. A notice of sale is a demand for payment on the
    mortgagor, and, if served on a guarantor, is a demand for payment from the
    guarantor: <em>National Trust Co. v. Maxwell </em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>(1989), 34 C.P.C. (2d) 211</span></em> (Ont. H.C.J.), at p. 218. It
    should also be noted that the action on the guarantee for deficiency was not
    commenced until September 2010.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Marsig defended the action, pleading that the action against
    him was statute-barred under the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. Thus, he
    submitted that his guarantee was a demand obligation subject to a two-year
    limitation period under the Act. He moved for summary judgment dismissing the
    action as statute-barred.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge dismissed the motion. Notwithstanding the
    argument of Mr. Marsig, the motion judge concluded that the guarantee was not a
    demand obligation under the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>,<i> </i>and held
    that the action on the guarantee was governed by the <em>Real Property
    Limitations Act</em>.  </p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the outset of the discussion, it is helpful to note that,
    Parts II and III of the former <em>Limitations Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, have been repealed.
    However, the definitions and Part I, which dealt exclusively with real property
    limitations, were renamed the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em>. A new
    Act, the <em>Limitations Act</em><i>, 2002</i>, was enacted to deal with
    limitation periods other than those affecting real property. The new act, the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> replaced Parts

    or damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or omission,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(iii) that the act or

  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3) For the purposes of subclause
    (1) (a) (i), the day on which injury, loss or damage occurs in relation to a
    demand obligation is the first day on which there is a failure to perform the

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Much of the argument before the motion judge, and some of the argument
    on this appeal, concerned whether the guarantee signed by Mr. Marsig was or was
    not a demand obligation. This was an important point for Mr. Marsig because, relying
    on <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. Williamson</em>, 2009 ONCA 754, 97 O.R. (3d) 561,
    he submitted that all demand obligations, including guarantees within a
    mortgage document, are governed by the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the purposes of deciding this appeal, I am prepared to assume,
    without deciding, that guarantee signed by Mr. Marsig was a demand obligation.
    With that assumption, it does not follow, however, that all demand obligations
    are governed by the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Williamson</em>, Feldman J.A. examined ss. 5(3) and (4) of
    the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. These subsections were added to the <em>Act</em><i> </i>in 2008 to deal specifically with the commencement of limitation periods
    for demand obligations. At para. 19, Justice Feldman stated: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>This amendment demonstrates the intent of the legislature that
    for all demand obligations, a demand is a condition precedent for the
    commencement of the limitation period. The legislature may be taken to have
    recognized that this puts the creditor in the position to extend the limitation
    period by failing to make a prompt demand. However, it creates more certainty
    in establishing the commencement date for the limitation period. Although this
    new section does not affect this case, it affirms the law regarding third party
    demand guarantees. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Marsig concludes from this paragraph in <em>Williamson</em> that the court ruled, for the purposes of the application of limitation
    periods, that all demand obligations are governed exclusively by the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002</em>. In other words, he submits that the Court of Appeal decided
    that demand obligation guarantees are never governed by the limitation periods
    in the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As noted by the motion judge, the problem with Mr. Marsig’s interpretation
    of <em>Williamson</em> is that the case did not concern the applicability or
    inapplicability of the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em><i>.</i> On the
    facts of that case, the loan being guaranteed was not connected to real
    property or to mortgage security. Thus, the Court of Appeal did not address the
    issue as to when, if at all, the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em> applies
    to a demand obligation associated with a mortgage of land or real property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the case at bar, the motion judge did his own analysis of the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002 </i>and the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em>. Relying, <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>among other things,</span></em><i> </i>on the<i> </i>unreported
    decision of Métivier J. in <em>Montreal Trust Co. of Canada v. Vanness Estate</em><i> </i>(19 August 2004), Ottawa, 02-CV-19501 (Ont. S.C.), aff’d,  [2005] O.J. No.
    594 (C.A.), the motion judge concluded that guarantees found in a mortgage
    instrument are governed by what is now s. 43(1) of the <i>R<em>eal Property
    Limitations Act</em> </i>and what was formerly s. 45(1)(k) of the <em>Limitations
    Act</em> and, before that, s. 49(1)(k) of the <em>Statute of Limitations</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the motion judge’s analysis, which is consistent
    with this court’s decision in <em>Martin v. Youngson</em> (1924), 55 O.L.R. 658
    (C.A.). In that case, this court held, at p. 663, that s. 49(1)(k) of the <em>Statute
    of Limitations</em>,<i> </i>now s. 43(1) of the <em>Real Property Limitations
    Act</em>, governed an action on a covenant contained in a mortgage. Thus, the
    court concluded that the ten-year limitation period applied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Martin</em>, Mr. Youngson (much like Mr. Marsig in the
    case at bar) signed an indenture of mortgage that contained clauses whereby he
    guaranteed the payment of the mortgage-moneys. Thirteen years after signing the
    guarantee, he was sued, and he successfully relied on the limitation period in
    s. 49(1)(k) of the <em>Statute of Limitations Act</em> (now s. 43(1)(k) of the <em>Real
    Property Limitations Act</em>) which imposed a limitation period of ten years
    for an &quot;an action upon a covenant contained in an indenture of mortgage.&quot;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Martin</em><i>,</i> the Ontario Supreme Court - Appellate
    Division upheld the lower court judgment, with Masten J.A. holding at p. 663:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I think that this is &quot;an action upon a covenant contained
    in an indenture of mortgage,&quot; and therefore comes within sec. 49, subsec 1
    (k), of the Limitations Act. The whole document, exhibit 1, is an indenture of
    mortgage. I express no opinion as to what would be the proper conclusion if the
    guaranty were contained in a separate collateral document. That point can be
    decided when it arises. But, so far as this action is concerned, it seems to me
    that it falls precisely within the words of the statute, and therefore that the
    period of limitation is 10 years, and not 20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Martin</em>, the choice of which limitation period to
    apply was a choice between the ten-year limitation period of s. 49(1)(k) for “a
    covenant contained in a mortgage” or the twenty-year limitation period of s.
    49(1)(b) of the <em>Statute of Limitations</em><i> </i>for “a bond or other
    specialty”. A “covenant” just means a promise, and Masten J.A. had no
    difficulty in concluding that a guarantee contained in a mortgage was a
    covenant contained in the mortgage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the case at bar, largely because of Feldman J.A.’s comment in <em>Williamson</em>,
    which, as noted above, must be considered in context, Mr. Marsig argued that
    the only relevant period is the two-year limitation period for demand
    obligations found in the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree. In my opinion, the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> does not apply precisely because s. 43 of the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em> applies. This follows because s. 2(1)(a) of the <em>Limitation Act, 2002</em><i> states </i>that the Act “applies to claims pursued in court proceedings other
    than ... proceedings to which the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em> applies”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Marsig, however, submits that <em>Real Property Limitations
    Act</em> does not apply because s. 43(3) provides that s. 43(1) does “not <span
lang=EN-US>extend the time for bringing an action if the time for bringing it
    is limited by any other</span> Act.” Again, I disagree with this submission,
    because the effect of s. 2(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em><i> </i>is
    to preclude the limitation periods of that Act from applying when the <em>Real
    Property Limitations Act</em> applies. Put simply, the <em>Limitations Act,
    2002</em>, was enacted to deal with limitation periods other than those
    affecting real property.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A guarantee given in conjunction with a mortgage transaction
    affects real property law rights. <span lang=EN-US>Guarantors, if they have

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Marsig argues that, having regard to the law’s typically
    protective approach to guarantors and in light of the policy perspective of
    fostering certainty and clear laws, this court’s decision in <em>Williamson</em> should be read as indicating that a two-year limitation period applies to all guarantees.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true that it may not always be easy to determine whether a
    particular guarantee, like the guarantee in <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v.
    Williamson</em>, is subject to the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> or, like the
    guarantee in the case at bar, is subject to the <em>Real Property Limitations
    Act</em>. However, it does not follow that that all guarantees should be
    treated the same way. It has been the case historically that guarantees
    associated with land transactions have different limitation periods from
    guarantees associated with contract claims. Moreover, as already noted, it is my
    view that the Legislature intended that all limitation periods affecting land
    be governed by the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The mortgage enforcement practice, as demonstrated in the case at
    bar, is to give guarantors notice of power of sale proceedings. In my view, it
    would cause much more confusion and uncertainty in the law, if the limitation
    period for enforcing the mortgage debt was different from the limitation period
    for enforcing guarantees of that debt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I note that if Mr. Marsig’s argument were accepted, it would do
    no favour to persons who have guaranteed a mortgage debt. Confronted with a
    shorter limitation period for the guarantee than for the mortgage debt,
    mortgagees would undoubtedly sue and attempt to collect on the whole debt
    outstanding rather than proceeding, as Equitable Trust did in the case at bar,
    to realize on the security in the real property and then suing only for any
    deficiency.</p>
