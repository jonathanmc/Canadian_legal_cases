  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Geoffrey B. Morawetz

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Skyservice Airlines Inc. collapsed in March 2010
    leaving over $1.5 million in unpaid bills for airport charges and air
    navigation services.  The question before this court is, who must bear this
    financial loss: the authorities who were obliged to and did provide those
    services, or the ultimate owners of the aircraft that were leased to Skyservice? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A similar question was answered by the Supreme
    Court of Canada </span><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>in <em>Canada
    3000 Inc. (Re); Inter-Canadian (1991) Inc. (Trustee of)</em>, 2006</span><span
lang=EN-US> SCC 24, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865, in the context of the collapse of the
    Canada 3000 and Inter-Canadian airlines. </span><span lang=EN-US> </span><span
lang=EN-US>In <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em>, the Supreme Court held that the
    authorities were entitled to seize and detain aircraft to recover amounts owed
    to them by the collapsed airlines without regard to the property interests of
    the aircraft owners.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge held that this case is
    indistinguishable from <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> in any relevant respect. 
    Consequently, the application judge concluded that the respondent authorities
    were entitled to seize and detain aircraft to recover amounts owed to them by
    Skyservice without regard to the property interests of the appellant aircraft
    owners.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I find that the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Skyservice was a Canadian airline, headquartered
    in Toronto and incorporated under the laws of Canada.  It offered domestic and
    international charter flight air service, and flew in and out of the Toronto Pearson  International Airport and the Ottawa MacDonald-Cartier International Airport on a regular basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Skyservice operated a fleet of twenty aircraft,
    which it leased from various lessors.  Three of the aircraft were leased from
    the appellants, IAI V, Inc., MCAP Europe Limited, and Celestial Aviation
    Trading 23 Limited.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ten of the aircraft it had operated were
    returned to the lessors of those aircraft shortly before Skyservice went into
    receivership on March 31, 2010.  The other ten aircraft, including the three
    leased from the appellants, were the subject of seizure and detention
    applications made by the respondents, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority
    (the “GTAA”), the Ottawa MacDonald-Cartier International Airport Authority (the
    “OMCIAA” and, together with the GTAA, the “Airport Authorities”), and NAV
    Canada.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 30, 2010, at around 5:30 p.m., all of
    Skyservice’s officers and directors resigned.  The officers and directors caused
    Skyservice to pay all of its statutory priority payables because of concern
    that it would not continue to operate after March 30.</span></p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>March 31, 2010</h2>
  <h3>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Receivership </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 31, 2010, Skyservice went into
    receivership.  At approximately 11:00 a.m., Gans J. granted a receivership
    order pursuant to the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.C. 1985,
    c. B-3 (“<em>BIA</em>”), s. 243(1),<i> </i>and the <i>Courts of Justice Act, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.43, s. 101<i>.</i>  Among other things, the Receivership Order
    appointed a receiver over the assets, undertakings and properties of
    Skyservice.  The receiver was authorized to wind down Skyservice’s business,
    but not to operate it.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Receivership Order also imposed a stay of
    proceedings in respect of Skyservice.  Paragraph 9 of the Receivership Order
    reads in part: “all rights and remedies against [Skyservice], the Receiver, or
    affecting [the assets, undertakings and properties of Skyservice], are hereby
    stayed and suspended except with the written consent of the Receiver or leave
    of this Court”.</span></p>
  <h3>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Suspension of licenses</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At approximately the time of the Receivership
    Order, Transport Canada (the airline’s regulator) suspended the air operator
    certificate and aircraft maintenance organization licenses and authorities held
    by Skyservice under s. 103.07(d) of</span><em><span lang=EN-US
style='color:red'> </span></em><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>the<em> Canadian Aviation Regulations</em>, SOR</span><span lang=EN-US>/96-433 (the “<em>CARs</em>”),

    Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>, R</span><span
lang=EN-US>.S.C. 1985, c. A-2.  This was done because Skyservice ceased
    business and could no longer meet the requirements of its air operator certificate,
    including possessing or having the authority or capacity to maintain or operate
    aircraft.  </span></p>
  <h3>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Termination of leases</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Skyservice’s cessation of business and the
    appointment of the receiver constituted events of default under the various
    aircraft leases between the lessors and Skyservice.  Subject to the provisions of
    the Receivership Order, the events of default would have permitted the lessors
    to exercise remedies under the applicable leases.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the Receivership Order was granted, MCAP
    and IAI purported to terminate their leases with Skyservice, but did not take
    physical possession or control of their aircraft.  None of the other lessors took
    physical possession of their aircraft.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At approximately 3:00 p.m., the GTAA commenced
    an <i>ex parte</i> application for an order under s. 9 of the <em>Airport
    Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act</em>, S.C. 1992, c. 5 (“<em>Airports Act</em>”)
    authorizing it to seize and detain aircraft until the amount Skyservice owed
    the GTAA was paid.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At around 5:00 p.m., the application was initially
    heard and solicitors for the lessors of the aircraft were in attendance and
    made submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>NAV Canada verbally requested similar relief to

    application under s. 56 of the <em>Civil Air Navigation Services
    Commercialization Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 20 (“<i>CANSCA</i>”).  Also on April
    6, 2010, the OMCIAA brought its application for an aircraft seizure and

    effective as of 6:30 p.m.  The Status Quo Order provided, among other things,
    that no person, including the receiver, was permitted to take, or cause any
    steps to be taken, to possess, repossess, or to dispossess Skyservice of any aircraft
    owned or operated by Skyservice, pending the hearing and determination of the
    GTAA’s and NAV Canada’s applications.  The lessors were permitted to take
    certain steps to relocate, inspect, protect and preserve the aircraft, provided
    that those steps were deemed not to constitute the exercise of custody, control
    or possession of the aircraft.</span></p>

    charges, it may be the subject of an application to seize and detain it.  The
    fact that there may be other persons, who are not liable to pay the outstanding

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Binnie J. discussed the meaning of “owner” in
    the legislative framework of aeronautics in Canada at paras. 54-56.  Binnie J. found
    that the policy and practice of Canada’s regulatory aeronautics scheme is to
    use the term “owner” to refer to those in legal custody and control of the
    aircraft, and that a person who is the “registered owner” of an aircraft
    constitutes an “owner”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>55      The policy and practice throughout the federal
    regulatory scheme is to use the term “owner” to refer to the person in legal
    custody and control of the aircraft, not the legal titleholder.  The <em>CARs</em>,
    for example, define owner as “the person who has legal custody and control of
    the aircraft” (s. 101.01(1)).  The <em>Aeronautics Act</em> refers only to
    “registered owners” and, under s. 4.4(5), only the operator or <em>registered</em> owner may face liability for charges imposed under that Act.  Section 3(1)
    defines a registered owner as the person to whom a certificate of registration
    has been issued and the <em>CARs</em> make clear that an aircraft may only be
    registered by an owner who, again, must have legal custody and control of the
    aircraft; see ss. 202.15 to 202.17.  Section 2(2) of <em>CANSCA</em> itself
    states that “[u]nless a contrary intention appears, words and expressions used
    in this Act have the same meaning as in subsection 3(1) of the <em>Aeronautics
    Act</em>.”  I appreciate that arguments are available to counter these points
    but in my view the legal titleholders have the better side of the debate.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>56      Internationally, the <em>Convention on International
    Civil Aviation</em>, December 7, 1944, Can. T.S. 1944 No. 36 (the “Chicago
    Convention”), does not require legal title to correspond with registered
    ownership.  Article 19 states that registration shall be in accordance with the
    laws of the contracting State.  It is common ground that, by virtue of ss.
    202.15, 202.16 and 202.17 of the <em>CARs</em>, an aircraft may only be
    registered in the Canadian Civil Aircraft Register by the “owner” of the
    aircraft as that term is defined under s. 101.01(1) of the <em>CARs</em>, and
    that that person is the entity having legal custody and control of the
    aircraft.  Thus an airline operating aircraft in Canada under a long-term lease
    is named on the Certificate of Registration as “owner” of the aircraft,
    notwithstanding that title is actually held by the lessor; see D. H. Bunker, <em>Canadian
    Aviation Finance Legislation </em>(1989), at p. 764.  We have been given no
    reason why the privatization legislation should be held to depart so strikingly
    from Canadian regulatory practice.</p>

lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At para. 70, Binnie J. addressed the meaning of
    “operator” and concluded that Canada 3000 and Inter-Canadian “owned or
    operated” the relevant aircraft at the dates of the applications </span><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>for seizure and detention orders:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>70      The <em>CARs</em>, adopted pursuant to <em>the
    Aeronautics Act</em>, provide that an “operator” in respect of an aircraft
    “means the person that has possession of the aircraft as owner, lessee or
    otherwise” (s. 101.01(1)).  At the dates of the applications for seizure and
    detention orders, Canada 3000 and Inter-Canadian were still the <em>registered</em> owners of the aircraft.  Accordingly, if the Court is to read the words of the
    detention remedy in the context of the realities of this industry previously
    discussed, it seems to me that those remedies must be available against the
    aircraft of Canada 3000 (except any aircraft already repossessed by the
    titleholder prior to the <em>CCAA</em> application on November 8, 2001) and Inter-Canadian.
    (Once a titleholder reclaims possession, it becomes an operator in possession
    within s. 55(1) of <em>CANSCA</em>. However, as its possession post-dates the
    charges, no personal liability is incurred on that account.)</p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Zoom Airlines Incorporated was in default under
    an aircraft lease.  The lessor, </span><span lang=EN>AerCap Group Services
    Inc., </span><span lang=EN-US>faxed a notice of default to Zoom on August 25, 2008
    at 3:05 p.m. indicating its intention to terminate the lease and repossess its
    aircraft if the default was not remedied.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The default was not remedied and, on August 26,

    written notice of termination to Zoom, Zoom’s insurer, and Transport Canada.  The lease provided that </span><span lang=EN>AerCap </span><span lang=EN-US>was
    entitled to take possession of the aircraft upon termination.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Early the next day, Zoom and AerCap exchanged a
    series of emails in which Zoom requested reinstatement of the lease upon
    payment.  AerCap refused the request, confirming termination of the lease and
    advising that it required possession of the aircraft and payment of arrears and
    then would provide a new lease.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>AerCap </span><span lang=EN-US>hired an agent to
    repossess its aircraft.  At about 2:23 p.m. on August 27, 2008, an employee of the
    agent met the aircraft as it arrived at the Calgary airport, boarded the
    aircraft and advised the pilot that he was taking possession of the aircraft. 
    He then collected the certificate of airworthiness, the certificate of
    registration and the logbooks.  The agent surrendered the two certificates to
    Transport Canada at about 4:30 p.m. and notified Transport Canada that the lease between Zoom and AerCap had been terminated.  At about 5:00 p.m.,
    Zoom filed a notice of intention under the <em>BIA</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile, at about 4 p.m., the Calgary Airport
    Authority obtained an <em>ex parte</em> seizure and detention order under s. 9
    the <i>Airports Act</i>.  At this point, Zoom was still listed in the Canadian
    Civil Aircraft Register as the owner of the aircraft.</span></p>

    certificate of registration and the logbooks, Zoom, as registered owner,
    transferred legal custody and control of the aircraft to AerCap pursuant to s.
    202.35 of the <em>CARs</em>.  AerCap became the “owner” of the aircraft because
    the transfer of legal custody and control cancelled Zoom’s registered ownership
    status and allowed AerCap to take complete responsibility for the operation and
    maintenance of the aircraft.  AerCap also became the “operator” of the aircraft
    when it was repossessed by the agent.</span></p>

    period following the granting of the <em>Status Quo</em><i> </i>Order was, in
    my view, equivalent to the position of the parties that were before the court
    in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em>. I must follow the same result.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>The application judge’s </span><span lang=EN-US>principal findings are set out in paras. 95 and 96 of his
    reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[95]    The outcome is, in my view, clear.  There was no
    repossession of Aircraft prior to the Receivership Order.  Repossession could
    not occur after the granting of the Receivership Order, absent consent of the
    Receiver or leave of the court, neither of which occurred.  Therefore, at the
    time that the <em>Status Quo</em> Order was granted, no lessor had completed
    repossession in the manner set out in <em>Zoom</em>.  In fact, no repossession
    took place until the order of April 15, 2010.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[96]    At the time of the Receivership Order
    and the </span><em>Status Quo</em><span lang=EN-US> Order, Skyservice was in
    possession of the airplanes.  It was still the registered owner.  It may not
    have had the ability to operate the Aircraft but, within the context of the
    principles set out in </span><em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em><span lang=EN-US>, it
    was, in my view, the “owner” or “operator” of the Aircraft. It remained “owner”
    or “operator” of the Aircraft as of April 6, 2010, by which time GTAA had
    amended its application, OMCIAA had formally commenced its application and NAV
    Canada had formally commenced its application. The priority dispute that then
    evolved with the Airport Authorities and NAV Canada was identical to that in </span><em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em><span lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge rejected the lessors’
    argument that <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> and <em>Zoom</em> should be
    distinguished on the basis that a stay in the receivership context (as in this
    case) cannot be equated with stays under the <em>CCAA</em> or Part III of the <em>BIA</em> (as in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> and <em>Zoom</em>).  The application judge
    disposed of this submission by pointing out that the parameters of the stay are
    defined by the language of the Receivership Order, not the receivership context
    generally.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge also rejected the lessors’
    assertion that the steps taken by the lessors to terminate their leases with
    Skyservice affected the availability of the detention remedy.  He found, at
    para. 93, that the “fundamental difficulty and fatal flaw with this position
    was that proceedings to enforce any remedy as against Skyservice were stayed”
    by the Receivership Order, and explained this finding, at para. 89:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[89]    Any action taken to terminate an
    Aircraft lease with Skyservice after the granting of the Receivership Order is
    the enforcement of a remedy against Skyservice, which, absent the written
    consent of the Receiver or leave of the Court, is expressly prohibited under
    paragraph 9 of the Receivership Order. No written consent of the Receiver was
    provided and no leave of the Court was granted.</span></p>

  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NATURE OF THE APPEAL</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that the sole issue on
    appeal is whether the application judge erred in holding that the respondents
    are entitled to the seizure and detention orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Broadly speaking, the appellants’ position is
    that the application judge erred in holding that Skyservice “owned or operated”
    aircraft for the purposes of s. 9 of the <em>Airports Act</em> and s. 56 of <em>CANSCA</em>. 
    The appellants attempt to distinguish this case from <i>Canada</i><i> 3000 </i>and<i> </i>submit that the principles in <i>Zoom</i> assist them.  They also raise
    several sub-issues based on the timing and content of the Airport Authorities’
    applications.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents submit that this is not a
    complicated case.  The application judge was asked to follow the principles of
    statutory interpretation as applied to s. 9 and s. 56 by Binnie J. in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em>, and made no error in doing so.  The respondents submit that <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> is not distinguishable from this case in any manner that resulted
    in Skyservice relinquishing or transferring its status as “owner” or “operator”
    of the relevant aircraft.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the application judge that a number
    of the lessors’ submissions in this proceeding are misplaced and need not be
    fully addressed.  Much of the written and oral argument in this appeal dealt
    with the correct interpretation of s. 9 of the <em>Airports Act</em> and s. 56
    of <em>CANSCA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.  </span></em>I would reinforce
    the point that the proper interpretation of these provisions was determined by
    the Supreme Court in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em>.  This appeal concerns the application
    judge’s decision to grant the seizure and detention orders given the Supreme
    Court’s decision in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em>, not a reinterpretation of the
    statutory requirements for a detention remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My analysis will proceed as follows.  First, I
    will address the appellants’ submission that the application judge applied the
    wrong test for an aircraft seizure and detention order.  Second, I will address
    whether the application judge erred in concluding that <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> provides a complete answer to this case.  If <em>Canada 3000</em> is not distinguishable from this case in a manner that affects the availability
    of the detention remedy, then there is no basis on which to interfere with the
    trial judge’s conclusion that <em>Canada 3000</em> provides a complete answer to
    this case and that the statutory requirements for the detention remedy were
    satisfied.  Third, I will address the sub-issues raised by the appellants.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that, unlike Canada 3000
    and Inter-Canadian, Skyservice no longer “owned or operated” the aircraft at
    the time the Airport Authorities and NAV Canada brought their seizure and
    detention applications.  This is because of four distinguishing features: (a) Skyservice
    went into receivership with no intention to continue operating, whereas Canada
    3000 shut down with a view to temporarily cease operations and restart with new
    financing; (b) Transport Canada suspended Skyservice’s air operator certificate
    and aircraft maintenance organization licenses, whereas there is no evidence
    that this occurred in <em>Canada 3000</em>; (c) the active steps taken by the
    lessors in purporting to terminate their leases with Skyservice were sufficient
    to come within the exception contemplated by Binnie J., as that exception was
    applied in <em>Zoom</em>; and (d) policy considerations have changed since <em>Canada
    3000</em> was decided such that it is no longer appropriate to rely on <em>Canada
    3000</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, and for the following reasons, none
    of these factors affected whether Skyservice “owned or operated” the aircraft
    in this case.  </span></p>
  <h3>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Cessation of business</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that Skyservice could not
    have been the owner or operator at the time of the Status Quo Order because
    Skyservice shut down with no intention to continue operating.  In support of
    this argument, the appellants point to the following facts: (i) all of the
    officers and directors of Skyservice resigned before the Receivership Order; (ii)
    Skyservice decided to cease all business; and (iii) Skyservice consented to the
    appointment of a receiver for the purpose of liquidating the company’s assets. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants’ arguments are without merit. 
    The facts that the appellants point to were also present in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> and the Supreme Court nevertheless found that Canada 3000 and Inter-Canadian were the owners or operators of the relevant aircraft.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-US>Canada</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US> 3000</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> is clear that intention to continue operating is irrelevant to an
    airline’s status as owner or operator.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before the airport authorities brought their
    applications to seize and detain the aircraft of Canada 3000, (i) the directors
    and officers of Canada 3000 had resigned, (ii) Canada 3000 had ceased
    operations and the entire fleet of aircraft had been grounded, and (iii) a
    trustee-in-bankruptcy had been appointed: <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em>, at
    paras. 13, 15.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, Inter-Canadian ceased operations and
    laid off 90 percent of its employees before the authorities brought their
    seizure and detention applications: <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em>, at paras.
    19-20.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Yet, despite the presence of these facts in <em>Canada
    3000</em>, the Supreme Court did not consider the debtor airline’s lack of
    intention to continue operating in determining whether Canada 3000 and
    Inter-Canadian “owned or operated” the relevant aircraft.</span></p>
  <h3>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Suspension of air operator certificate</span></em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argued that Skyservice could not
    have “owned or operated” the aircraft at the time of the Status Quo Order
    because Skyservice shut down without the legal capacity to continue operating,
    as Transport Canada suspended Skyservice’s air operator certificate and
    aircraft maintenance organization licenses at approximately the time of the Receivership
    Order.  The appellants place considerable significance on the cancellation of
    the air operator certificate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In support of this argument, the appellants
    submitted that “operator” should be interpreted as meaning a person who can
    legally operate an aircraft.  In the case of a large aircraft, this could only
    be the holder of an aircraft operator certificate or a private operate
    certificate, and Skyservice had neither.  The appellants submitted that an
    “owner” is virtually always an “operator”, except in limited circumstances that
    do not apply in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I reject the appellants’ position.  This court
    is bound by the interpretation of the phrase “owned and operated” set out by
    the Supreme Court in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em><em><span style='font-style:

    operator certificate and licenses does not impact whether Skyservice “owned” or

    is defined as “the person who has legal custody and control of the aircraft”.  The

    This finding is supported by the records of the Canadian Civil Aircraft
    Register, which identified Skyservice as the registered owner of all the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that <i>Zoom</i> broadens
    the exception to the detention remedy contemplated in <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> to circumstances where a lessor took active steps to obtain
    legal control and custody, and not just where repossession has actually
    occurred.  The appellants contend that, although they may not have completed
    repossession of their aircraft, the active steps they did take to attempt to
    terminate their leases were sufficient to come within the exception to the
    detention remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The problem with the appellants’ arguments is
    that the appellants agree with the application judge’s finding, at paras.
    89-93, that their purported lease terminations could not have deprived
    Skyservice of its owner or operator statuses because the Receivership Order
    stayed the enforcement of any remedy against Skyservice.  While I appreciate
    the appellants’ desire for clarity with respect to the impact of a valid lease
    termination on the availability of the detention remedy, given the application
    judge’s unchallenged finding that the stay rendered the appellants’ purported
    terminations ineffective, these arguments are irrelevant to this appeal. </span></p>
  <h3>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Policy</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that the application judge
    erred in relying on Binnie J.’s finding in <em>Canada 3000</em> that aircraft
    lessors are in a better position than the Airport Authorities and NAV Canada to
    protect themselves from the default of an airline.  The appellants submit that
    the application judge erred in failing to consider that airport authorities now
    have the legal right to obtain prior security to protect their positions, and
    can now withdraw the provision of their services to defaulting airline
    customers.  These authorities, the appellants submit, also have a “panoply of
    remedies” available to secure payment from airlines, and are better posed than
    the lessors to assess and protect themselves against risk.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I cannot accept that <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> is not to be
    considered controlling authority on this basis for several reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, findings in this regard by the application judge, if any,
    were <em>obiter</em>.  The application judge did not rely on policy grounds as
    a free-standing basis for determining whether the Airport Authorities and NAV
    Canada were entitled to the detention remedy in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, there is no evidence that the legal position of airport
    authorities was any different at the time <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> was
    decided.  None of the parties were able to confirm that any changes to airport
    authorities’ legal rights were made <u>after</u> <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> was decided in 2006.</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Third, s. 9(1) of the <em>Airports Act</em> and s. 56(1) of <em>CANSCA</em> are clear that the seizure and detention remedy is available to the Airport
    Authorities and NAV Canada “in addition to any other remedy available” for the
    collection of the amounts owing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fourth, <i>Canada</i><i> 3000</i> clearly confirms, at para. 74,
    that aircraft may be seized and detained without regard to the property
    interests of people who are not the registered owners or operators of the
    aircraft. </span></p>
  <h3>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For all of the above reasons, I see no basis on which to interfere
    with the trial judge’s conclusion that <em>Canada</em><em> 3000</em> provides a
    complete answer this case.  <em>Canada</em><em> 3000 </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>is factually indistinguishable from this case in any
    relevant respect and, </span></em>accordingly, <em><span style='font-style:

  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Sub-issues</h2>
  <h3>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Was the GTAA’s <em>ex
    parte</em> application valid?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that the GTAA was not entitled to bring its
    seizure and detention application on an <em>ex parte</em> basis because the
    criteria for bringing an <em>ex parte</em> application, as set out in s. 9(2)
    of the <em>Airports Act</em>, were not met.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Section 9(2) of the <em>Airports Act</em> specifies that an <em>ex
    parte</em> application may be brought where the airport authority “has reason
    to believe that the person liable to pay the amount is about to leave Canada or take from Canada any aircraft owned or operated by the person”.  The appellants point out
    that there is no evidence suggesting that Skyservice was about to leave or take
    any of the aircraft out Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This ground of appeal is misguided.  Although the GTAA commenced its
    application on an <em>ex parte</em> basis at approximately 3:00 p.m. on March
    31, 2010, by 5:00 p.m. the parties had been given notice and counsel for the
    lessors, NAV Canada and the receiver were in attendance before the application
    judge prior to the granting of the Status Quo Order.  Various counsel made
    submissions before the application judge, yet none of the parties objected to
    the GTAA’s application on these grounds at that time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, the very purpose of the Status Quo Order was to allow the
    various applications for seizure and detention orders to be heard on notice and
    the applications were heard on notice in June 2010.  All parties filed evidence
    and were granted their procedural rights, including the right to make written
    and oral submissions and the right to cross-examine.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Given the way the proceedings transpired, I do not accept the
    appellants’ position that the GTAA’s application should now be rendered
    invalid.  I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h3 style='line-height:normal'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the OMCIAA entitled to bring its claim after the Status Quo Order?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellants submit that the OMCIAA is not entitled to the seizure and detention
    order as it did not bring its application until after the Status Quo Order was
    granted.  The OMCIAA was not present or even mentioned at the hearing on March
    31, 2010 so, the appellants contend, the OMCIAA should not be entitled to
    retroactively obtain any rights that the GTAA and NAV Canada may have as of the
    Status Quo Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants acknowledge that this argument was specifically
    raised by the appellants at the hearing of the seizure and detention
    applications, and rejected by the application judge.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The application judge was well aware of the timing of the OMCIAA’s
    application, yet did not consider it contrary to the Status Quo Order to allow
    the OMCIAA to bring its application in the circumstances.  This is clear as the
    application judge granted the Status Quo Order on March 31, 2010 – prior to the
    OMCIAA bringing its application on April 6, 2010 – and then approved the
    release protocol on April 9, 2010, which included the OMCIAA as one of the
    airport authorities whose application was pending determination.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>I see no basis on which to
    interfere with the application judge’s decision.  I read the Status Quo Order as
    intending to <span lang=EN-US>prevent the parties from changing the
    circumstances on the ground in a way that would affect the success of the
    GTAA’s and NAV Canada’s applications.  I do not read the order as being
    designed to strip the OMCIAA of its legal rights without notice.  Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h3 style='line-height:normal'>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can IAI’s aircraft be the subject of the detention order when it was not
    identified in the GTAA’s initial notice of application?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that the aircraft leased by Skyservice from
    IAI was not identified in the initial notice of application issued by GTAA on
    March 31, 2010, so should not be subject to the seizure and detention order. 
    The appellants argue that the Status Quo Order should not be used to distort
    rights, but that is exactly what would occur if the Airport Authorities are allowed
    to pile additional aircraft into their applications in the face of a Status Quo
    Order preventing the lessors from taking steps to become the owner or operator
    of those aircraft.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This submission is without merit.  While the IAI aircraft was not
    listed in the GTAA’s initial notice of application, there is no dispute that
    this aircraft was subject to the Status Quo Order.  The order preserved the
    status quo with respect to the aircraft specifically listed in the GTAA’s
    initial notice of application as well as “any other aircraft owned or operated
    by [Skyservice]”, so unquestionably captures more aircraft than the aircraft
    specifically identified in the initial notice of application.  The inclusion of
    the IAI aircraft thus cannot be characterized as a distortion of rights.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, before the hearing of the applications, on April 5, 2010,
    the GTAA amended its notice of application to expressly refer to the IAI
    aircraft.  Accordingly, the application judge did not err in including the IAI
    aircraft within the scope of the seizure and detention order.</span></p>
  <h3>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Was the detention

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>The appellants did not press this issue in oral argument.  In any
    event, I will deal with it briefly.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In their factum, the appellants submitted that the application judge
    correctly found, at para. 61 of his reasons, that an important principle of <i>Canada</i><i> 3000 </i>is that “the right to the detention remedy is subject to any stay
    that is in place”, but misapplied this principle when finding, at para. 99,
    that the detention remedy in this case was unaffected by the stay.  As such,
    they contend that the stay should apply to the detention order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I reject this submission.  The application judge’s findings are
    consistent with the parameters of the stay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The stay set out in the Receivership Order reads, in part: “all
    rights and remedies against [Skyservice], the Receiver, or affecting [the
    assets, undertakings and properties of Skyservice], are hereby stayed and
    suspended except with the written consent of the Receiver or leave of this
    Court”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The detention remedy is not a remedy against Skyservice.  <i>Canada
    3000</i>, at paras. 9 and 68, is clear that the seizure and detention remedy in
    s. 9 of the <em>Airports Act</em> and s. 56 of <em>CANSCA</em> is a remedy
    against the aircraft, not against the debtor airline.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The detention remedy is also not a remedy affecting the assets,
    undertakings and properties of Skyservice.  Since the aircraft were all the
    subject of true leases, at no time did the aircraft form part of the “assets,
    undertakings and properties” of Skyservice.  Skyservice had the ability to use
    and operate the aircraft, but not legal title to them.  Legal title to the
    aircraft remained with the lessors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
