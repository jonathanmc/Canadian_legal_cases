    assault. She suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. She reported the alleged
    assault to the police approximately three weeks after she says it occurred. Her
    videotaped statement to the police was admitted as evidence at the trial, on
    consent, under s. 715.2 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The complainant also
    gave oral evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The complainant said she met her assailant on two occasions
    before the assault occurred: once, at his apartment, for coffee; and on a
    second occasion, briefly, at her apartment. She said she accompanied the
    appellant to his apartment on the day of the assault after running into him at
    a mall. She described his apartment as being in the basement of a red brick
    house near the mall.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    her assailant at the mall. She wrote down the licence number of the white van
    he was driving as 933 1K7. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    basement apartment of a red brick house. The license number of his white van
    was 933 1KE. A sketch of the lay-out of his apartment prepared by one of the
    arresting officers closely matched a sketch prepared by the complainant during
    her interview with the police. And whereas the complainant had described the
    appellants bed as having a brown comforter with a big tiger on it, police found
    a blue comforter with a big picture of a wolf on it.</p>

    complainant picked the appellant's photograph out of a photographic line-up
    presented to her by the police. The appellants photograph was the fifth
    photograph in the photographic line-up booklet. The officer who conducted the
    identification procedure testified that the complainant said, thats not him,
    when shown each of the first four photographs. When she saw the fifth
    photograph, the complainant said, thats him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fifth photograph was the only photograph in the booklet
    depicting a man with a full moustache. The complainant had not mentioned facial
    hair in her videotaped statement to the police. Moreover, the photograph
    demonstrates that the appellant has blue eyes, not brown eyes as described by
    the complainant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When asked at trial who she thought was in the photograph she
    selected during the photo line-up, the complainant answered: [w]ell, the face
     the face, I remember  the face looked the same, but the hair and moustache
    looked different. She said, [h]is  When I seen him, his hair and moustache
    wasnt even like that. When asked in what way it wasnt like that, she said,
    [l]ike a brush cut. It was grey  pepper/salt, and he had a grey moustache.
    This description was very different from her description of the appellants
    hair in her videotaped statement to the police, in which she described her
    attackers hair as dark brown, curly and wavy and made no mention of a
    moustache or facial hair.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After watching her videotaped statement to the police at trial,
    the complainant said she made two mistakes in her description of the
    perpetrator in the statement: his hair and his name. In her videotaped
    statement to the police, the complainant said her attackers name was Mark
    Williams  as opposed to Marc Charbonneau. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial was held almost two years after the date of the sexual
    assault. The appellant was in the courtroom at the time. However, when the
    complainant was asked to look around the courtroom during her examination
    in-chief, she said she did not recognize the appellant, unless hes gained a
    lot of weight, or something.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <h1>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Discussion</h1>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='
line-height:normal'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in her instructions to the jury concerning
    eyewitness identification evidence?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his factum, appellants counsel argued that the eyewitness
    identification evidence in this case was so flawed as to make the guilty
    verdict unreasonable. During oral argument, appellants counsel acknowledged
    that, when combined with the circumstantial evidence of identity, the
    identification evidence was sufficient to support a guilty verdict.
    Nonetheless, appellants counsel maintained that the trial judge made
    reversible errors in her instructions to the jury concerning the eyewitness
    identification evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In particular, the appellant submitted that the errors and
    inconsistencies in the complainants descriptions of her attacker made her
    identification of the appellant virtually no identification at all. This was
    particularly the case given that the complainant was unable to identify the
    appellant in the courtroom at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argued that, in these circumstances, the trial
    judge should have told the jury that the complainants inability to identify
    the appellant in the courtroom, combined with her inconsistencies when
    describing her attackers physical appearance, required the jury to be
    extremely cautious before accepting the complainants evidence. Moreover, the
    trial judge should have specifically instructed the jury that the errors and
    inconsistencies in the complainants description were capable of raising a
    reasonable doubt. Finally, in her charge to the jury the trial judge should
    have emphasized that there is no link between a witnesss certainty at the time
    of a photo line-up identification and the reliability of that identification. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Instead, the trial judge gave the following concluding
    instruction on identification, which on appeal the appellant claimed undermined
    some of the trial judges earlier cautions:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is not necessary that an identification witness  such as
    [the complainant], in this case  be free from doubt about the correctness or
    certainty of her identification, or that she continued to be able to identify
    the accused as the offender, at the time of trial. What is required, however,
    before you find [the appellant] guilty of the offence, is that you be satisfied,
    beyond a reasonable doubt, on the whole of the evidence, that it was [the
    appellant] who committed the offence. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>I should also add that, at no time, while giving her
    evidence in court, did [the complainant] express any doubt about her
    identification at the time of the photo line-up.</em> What she did express was
    that, today, she did not recognize [the appellant], and was not able to say,
    today, that he was her assailant. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argued that the inadequacies of the charge to the
    jury could be analogized to those in the charge at issue in <em>R. v. Richards</em> (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.). In <em>Richards</em>, this court concluded
    that the shortcomings of the charge necessitated a new trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept the appellants submissions. The trial judge
    began her instructions on eyewitness identification evidence with the standard
    instruction that juries must be very cautious about relying on eyewitness testimony
    to find someone guilty of a criminal offence. She told the jury that miscarriages
    of justice have occurred because eyewitnesses have made mistakes in identifying
    the persons whom they saw committing the crime and that honest witnesses can
    make mistakes and yet appear convincing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did tell the jury that the complainants
    description of her attacker matched, in many respects, the description given by
    the arresting officer. And she did state that, apart from the complainants
    descriptions of the attackers hair and moustache, the jury might find her
    evidence quite consistent. However, the trial judge also said that [i]t was
    obvious that the complainant was not clear about her assailants hair and
    moustache. In addition, the trial judge reminded the jury that the complainant
    did not recognize the appellant in the courtroom. Later, when reviewing the
    evidence and the position of the defence, the trial judge also reminded the
    jury of the specific errors and inconsistencies in the complainants eyewitness
    evidence identifying the appellant as her attacker.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, it would have been preferable had the trial judge
    omitted the part of her instruction we have emphasized above in para. 17,
    reminding the jury that the complainant did not express any doubt about her
    identification at the time of the photo line-up. As the trial judge had already
    told the jury, honest and convincing eyewitnesses can still make mistakes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That said, read as a whole, the trial judges instructions were
    sufficient to bring to the jurys attention: the frailties in eyewitness
    identification evidence, generally; the errors and inconsistencies in the
    complainants eyewitness identification evidence, specifically; and the
    requirement that the jury was not to convict the appellant unless satisfied of
    his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Unlike <em>Richards</em>, it was evident
    in the case at bar that the trial judge made a concerted effort to balance in
    her charge: (i) the specific frailties of the complainants evidence, and (ii) the
    evidence which supported the complainants testimony.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also agree with counsels acknowledgment that, when combined
    with the circumstantial evidence of identity, the identification evidence was
    capable of supporting a guilty verdict. Accordingly, we do not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='
line-height:normal'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in ruling that, in the event the appellant
    elected to testify, he would be subject to cross-examination on his criminal
    record?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the conclusion of the Crowns case, defence counsel at trial
    (not Mr. Snell) brought a <em>Corbett</em><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><i><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></b></span></i></span></a> application seeking a ruling that the Crown be prohibited from cross-examining
    the appellant on two convictions for sexual assault entered in 1992. Although
    the trial judge ruled that the Crown could cross-examine the appellant on these
    two entries, she qualified her ruling by directing that the Crown could not
    refer to the sexual nature of the assaults.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
    holding that the appellant could be cross-examined on the two convictions at
    issue. Specifically, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred because,
    in reaching her decision, the trial judge relied, in part, on the fact that
    appellants counsel had cross-examined the complainant (and other witnesses)
    about the complainants mental health.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept the appellants argument. Even if the trial
    judge erred in this aspect of her reasoning, we see no error in the remainder
    of her reasons nor in her ultimate decision on the <em>Corbett</em> application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant had multiple entries
    for assault and other offences in his criminal record. However, the trial judge
    noted that deleting reference to the 1992 convictions from his records would
    suggest that there was a significant period in which the appellant lived a
    law-abiding life in the community when, in reality, he was serving a
    penitentiary sentence. As well, the trial judge noted, the sentences he
    received for the 1992 convictions were significantly longer than any other
    sentence he has received. In her words, allowing cross-examination on these
    convictions would allow the jury to fairly gauge just how hardened a criminal
    they consider [the appellant] to be, and what impact his criminal record has on
    their assessment of his credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Throughout her reasons on the <em>Corbett</em> application, the
    trial judge properly focused on the need to weigh the probative value of the
    evidence to the jurys assessment of the appellants credibility against the prejudicial
    effect of its inclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Moreover, it was appropriate for
    the trial judge to sanitize the appellants record by requiring the sexual
    assaults from 1992 to be described only as assaults: </span><em>R. v. Batte</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 498 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 51.
