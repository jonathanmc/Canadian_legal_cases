    and the sentence imposed on November 12, 2009 by Justice Lloyd Budzinski of the
    Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions for sexual assault and utter death
    threat on the ground that in applying the third stage of the <i>W.D</i>.
    analysis, the trial judge misapprehended the evidence of the complainant and
    relied on inferences from her evidence that did not logically support the
    conclusion that he drew from them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the complainant and the appellant testified at the trial. They were
    both friends of another young man, T.F., but had not met each other until that
    evening. There was no issue that they had a lengthy sexual encounter on the
    evening in question. The issue was whether it was consensual or forced on the
    complainant by the appellant. The appellant told her he would drive her home. The
    assault occurred when they were walking, supposedly to the appellants car. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the appellants evidence for credibility and reliability,
    the trial judge noted that he demonstrated a pattern of boasting and
    inflationary thinking. As an example, the trial judge mentioned that the
    appellant spoke of one time driving a Lincoln Navigator and working at jobs only
    if the minimum pay was $12 an hour. In fact, however, he had no place to stay,
    having been ejected from a hostel, and no money at the time. The trial judge
    concluded that the appellants tendency to boast undermined his credibility and
    was consistent with the complainants description of his boasting about his
    potentials.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred and misapprehended
    the evidence when he said that the complainant gave evidence of the appellants
    boasting. However, there was some evidence from the complainant, given in
    cross-examination, where the complainant was asked about what occurred after
    the assault. The appellant had walked her to the bus stop and while walking, he
    said that she was going to be his girlfriend, and because of that, he was
    prepared to tell her that he had lied to her earlier when he told her he had a
    car, and that he never had a car. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge stated that their descriptions of the boasting were not
    the same, but that the appellants description was consistent with the
    complainants. In light of the fact that the appellant had told her  or
    boasted - that he had a car when he did not, and that in evidence he had referred
    to having (boasted about) a Lincoln Navigator, in our view the trial judge did
    not err in his apprehension that the complainant had described some boasting by
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In assessing the complainants
    credibility, the trial judge referred to her as giving her evidence in an
    objective manner. In support, he pointed to two aspects of her evidence: (1)
    that she was open about the fact that she was angry at T.F. because she was
    supposed to sleep at his house that night; and (2) that she described the appellant
    after the attack as friendly and as wanting to continue the relationship. The
    trial judge explained that these statements could be viewed as inconsistent
    with someone who was attacked against her will or who was trying to falsely
    blame someone to get the attention of her boyfriend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant argues first that the
    trial judge misapprehended the complainants evidence about the accused after
    the attack and second, that the inference he drew from her evidence did not
    follow logically from that evidence. We do not agree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant was asked a number of
    times in examination in-chief and cross-examination about what the accused said
    and did after the attack. She described how he walked her to the bus stop so
    that she could take the bus home, and on the way he told her that she would now
    be his girlfriend and that she was pretty. He also threatened her and T.F. with
    death if she told anyone about the attack. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In totality, it was not an unfair
    characterization of her evidence by the trial judge to say that she described
    the appellant as friendly in the context of deciding whether she was credible.
    He concluded that she was essentially straightforward and he drew the inference
    that she was not embellishing to suit a purpose, which enhanced her credibility.
    He was entitled to view her evidence in that way and made no error in so doing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellants submission is that the
    trial judges conclusions regarding the complainants evidence amounted to
    misapprehensions of her evidence and did not support his finding on the third
    branch of <i>W.D.</i> that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt based on the evidence that the court accepted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In our view, the trial judge did not
    misapprehend the evidence. He referred to the law as set out in <i>W.D</i>. He
    was entitled to reject the evidence of the appellant and accept and act on the
    evidence of the complainant in order to find that the charges of sexual assault
    and utter a death threat to the complainant were proved beyond a reasonable
    doubt. In contrast, he was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the count
    of threatening death to T.F. and dismissed that count.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
