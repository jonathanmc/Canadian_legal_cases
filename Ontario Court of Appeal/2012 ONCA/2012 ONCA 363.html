  <p class=Heard>Heard: November 22, 2011</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ian A. MacDonnell
    of the Superior Court of Justice dated April 6, 2009, with reasons reported at
    (2009), 96 O.R. (3d) 20.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Juriansz
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In four recent decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada has addressed the
    content and scope of s. 2(d) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>,
    which protects freedom of association, as it applies to employees’ associational
    activities in pursuit of workplace goals. In those decisions, the Supreme Court
    set out the principles that were necessary to resolve the particular issues
    posed by those cases. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet many issues regarding the <i>Charter</i>’s guarantee of freedom of
    association in the labour context remain. This appeal raises questions that
    were not directly contemplated in the previous cases. One new question is
    whether “the right to collective bargaining” under s. 2(d) guarantees workers
    the right to be represented in their relationship with their employer by an
    association of their own choosing. Another new question is whether “the right
    to collective bargaining” under s. 2(d) requires that the vehicle for dealing
    with workers’ collective concerns with management be structurally independent
    of management. I answer these questions based on my understanding of the
    Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. They will ultimately, in this case or another,
    have to be decided by the Supreme Court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mounted Police Association of Ontario (“MPAO”) and the British
    Columbia Mounted Police Professional Association (“BCMPPA”) commenced a <em>Charter</em> application, challenging the validity of three provisions governing the current
    labour relations regime for members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
    (“RCMP”). The two associations, representing the individuals who are their
    members, sought a declaration that s. 2(1)(d) of the <em>Public Service Labour
    Relations Act</em>, S.C. 2003, c. 22 (“<i>PSLRA</i>”), and ss. 41 and 96 of the <em>Royal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations, 1988</em>, SOR/88-361 (“<i>Regulations</i>”),
    infringe ss. 2(b), 2(d) and 15 of the <em>Charter</em>. <span lang=FR-CA>Two
    other associations, the Canadian Police Association (“CPA”) and l’Association
    des Membres de la Police Montée du Québec Inc. </span>(“AMPMQ”), intervene in
    support of the MPAO and BCMPPA. The Mounted Police Members’ Legal Fund (“Legal
    Fund”) intervenes in support of the Attorney General.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>PSLRA</i> establishes a labour relations scheme that enables most
    employees of the federal public service to engage in a process of collective
    bargaining with management. Section 2(1)(d) of the <i>PSLRA</i> excludes
    members of the RCMP from that regime. The RCMP members have a separate employee
    relations scheme, the Staff Relations Representative Program (“SRRP”),
    established by s. 96 of the <i>Regulations</i>. Section 41 of the <i>Regulations</i> prohibits members of the RCMP from publicly criticizing the Force. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that s. 96 of the <i>Regulations</i> infringes s. 2(d) of the <em>Charter</em>, which guarantees freedom of
    association, and that this infringement could not be justified under s. 1. The
    application judge dismissed the associations’ other claims. The Attorney
    General of Canada appeals the holding that s. 96 of the <i>Regulations</i> violates s. 2(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. The MPAO and the BCMPPA cross-appeal from
    the application judge’s dismissal of two of their claims relating to s. 41 of
    the <i>Regulations</i> and s. 2(1)(d) of the <i>PSLRA</i>. The relevant
    legislative provisions are set out in the Appendix to these reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on my reading of the Supreme Court’s s. 2(d) jurisprudence, I
    would allow the Attorney General’s appeal and dismiss the respondents’
    cross-appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUNd</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The Parties and
    Interveners</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The MPAO, BCMPPA and AMPMQ are independent private associations of RCMP
    members. Their existence is not contemplated by any statute or regulation. They
    have been organized at the initiative of individual RCMP members acting in
    concert. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The MPAO was incorporated in 1998 and has approximately 500 members in Ontario.
    The BCMPPA, based in British Columbia, was incorporated in 1994 and has about 2,000
    members. However, the total number of paid up members of both the MPAO and the
    BCMPPA was 890 in 2008 (the latest figures in the record). The AMPMQ was
    established in 1985 and claims to represent the majority of the members of the
    RCMP in Quebec, although there are no membership statistics in the record. In
    2008, there were approximately 20,000 members of the RCMP in Canada. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These associations aspire to represent RCMP members in collective
    bargaining. The associations are currently unable to do so under the <i>PSLRA</i> because s. 2(1)(d) of that Act excludes the RCMP from its application. More
    specifically, while RCMP members are free to form and participate in the lawful
    activities of employee organizations of their choice, voluntary employee
    organizations, such as the respondents, cannot apply to the Public Service
    Staff Relations Board to be certified as the bargaining agent for a proposed
    bargaining unit. Individual RCMP members and the employee organizations they
    form are therefore excluded from the entire regulatory regime for collective
    bargaining provided by the <i>PSLRA</i> that is available to most other federal
    public employees. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    MPAO, BCMPPA and AMPMQ are also not recognized by RCMP management. While the
    associations purport to provide a collective means of raising and resolving
    employment issues, and while RCMP members are free to form and join such
    associations, s. 96 of the <i>Regulations </i>establishes the SRRP as the
    process by which RCMP members can address labour issues with RCMP management.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CPA, an umbrella group of 172 police associations across Canada, intervenes in
    support of the associations. It represents some 56,800 police personnel at the
    federal, provincial and municipal levels. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
    participating as an intervener, the Legal Fund is a not-for-profit corporation under
    the <i>Canada Corporations Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-32. It was established to
    help RCMP members with various employment-related issues arising under RCMP
    policies and directives. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The SRRP</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    96(1) of the <i>Regulations</i> provides that the RCMP shall have a Staff
    Relations Representative Program “to provide for representation of the
    interests of all members with respect to staff relations matters.” The SRRP is
    organized divisionally (by province or territory) and regionally to align with
    the management configuration of the RCMP. Section 96(2) provides that the
    program shall be carried out by the “representatives of the members of the
    divisions and zones who elect them”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    representatives of the members are called Staff Relations Representatives (“SRRs”).
    The collective body of SRRs is the National Caucus, and there are also Regional
    and Divisional Caucuses. There are 34 SRRs elected by RCMP members and an
    additional five “national representatives” elected by the National Caucus.
    There are also 150 elected part-time sub-SRRs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    SRRP has a National Executive Committee (“NEC”). The NEC is comprised of one SRR
    from each of the RCMP’s five regions and two full-time SRRs who are elected by
    the National Caucus. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    set out in the SRRP Constitution, the duties of SRRs include providing
    information, guidance and support to RCMP members and representing RCMP members’
    interests in negotiations with the management of the RCMP: <i>RCMP Staff
    Relations Representative Program Constitution</i>, July 14, 2004. SRRs attend
    divisional management meetings at which issues affecting the employment
    conditions of their constituents are considered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    formal agreement between the Commissioner and the SRRP provides that management
    will recognize the role of the SRRP, respond to proposals and requests from
    SRRs in a timely and open fashion, and provide rationales for major decisions: <i>Agreement
    Between the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Staff
    Relations Representative Program</i>, clause 11, October 28, 2002. The
    agreement also provides that management and the SRRP will consult on specific human
    resources initiatives in a meaningful and timely fashion and participate
    together in national policy centre committees. Although final decisions rest
    with management, consultation is meant to promote an active participatory
    regime.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause
    18 of the agreement between the SRRP and the Commissioner provides that the two
    full-time SRRs on the NEC “will be the formal point of contact for the SRR
    Caucus, and its Committees, with the Commissioner, Senior Management, and the
    Solicitor General of Canada.” The two SRRs attend all meetings of the RCMP’s
    Senior Management Team, which meets three times a year, to identify and
    consider the key issues in policing and law enforcement confronting the RCMP,
    and all meetings of the Senior Executive Committee, which develops force-wide
    policies for the RCMP.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Treasury Board has the ultimate authority to establish pay and allowances for
    RCMP members. Before exercising that authority, Treasury Board receives the
    recommendations of the RCMP Pay Council. The Pay Council was established in May
    1996 to provide an alternative to the traditional collective bargaining model
    set out in the <i>PSLRA</i>. It has five members, made up of two SRRs, two
    representatives of management and an impartial chair. Its mandate on issues
    concerning pay and benefits is broad. Before making its recommendations, it
    solicits the views and input of the membership of the RCMP. Its recommendations
    are then presented to the Commissioner, and if they are accepted by the
    Commissioner, they form the basis of a Treasury Board submission. The submission
    is first reviewed by the Minister of Public Safety, and if the Minister
    approves it, it is presented to Treasury Board on behalf of the Commissioner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of the SRRP was not always provided for by the <i>Regulations</i>.
    The SRRP was first established in 1974, after the creation of the <i>Public
    Service Staff Relations Act</i>, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-35 (“<span class=italic><i>PSSRA</i></span>”)
    in 1967. The <i>PSSRA</i> was enacted to provide a comprehensive labour
    relations regime for members of the federal public service, but it excluded
    RCMP members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was significant dissatisfaction among RCMP members with their exclusion from
    the federal labour relations regime, and some began to organize an association.
    Representatives of that group met with the RCMP Commissioner, who proposed a 14-point
    plan for a more formal employee relations system, featuring full-time, elected member
    representatives. Those who were in attendance agreed to take the proposal back
    to their divisions, hold a referendum on it, and report back to the
    Commissioner. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was overwhelming acceptance of the Commissioner’s proposals by members in every
    division, except members of “C” Division in Quebec who voted against the
    proposal. This led to the establishment of the Division Staff Relations
    Representative (DSRR) Program, which eventually evolved into the SRRP.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> The Wagner Model</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    will be discussed below, the Attorney General takes the position that what the
    associations seek is access to a Wagner model of labour relations. To make
    sense of that claim, and to understand how the SRRP compares with that model,
    it is helpful to review what is meant by the Wagner model. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Wagner model is named after New York Senator Robert F. Wagner, who sponsored
    the <i>National Labour Relations Act</i> (“NLRA”) enacted by the United States
    Congress in 1935. The <i>NLRA</i>, which is also known as the “<i>Wagner Act</i>”,
    is the template for most legislated labour regimes in North America. Most
    Canadian provinces passed legislation incorporating the main objectives of the <i>Wagner
    Act</i> by the end of the 1930s. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Wagner model is a legislated labour regime of collective bargaining with
    several distinctive features. A single, exclusive bargaining agent is
    recognized for employees in a “bargaining unit” through a certification
    application to an independent labour board. To protect employees engaged in
    collective activities from employer interference or reprisal, employers are
    prohibited from using “unfair labour practices”. Employers are required to
    recognize and bargain in good faith with the employees’ bargaining agent, who
    in turn must bargain in good faith with the employer. Finally, disputes that
    occur during the life of a collective agreement must be dealt with by
    arbitration rather than strike or lock-out. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Majoritarianism/exclusivity”
    is a fundamental principle of the Wagner model. Majoritarianism/exclusivity
    means that the association supported by the majority of employees in the
    bargaining unit has the exclusive right to bargain on behalf of all employees
    in the unit. In a Wagner labour regime, an association that represents a
    minority of the employees, as much as 49 per cent of them, has no right to
    collectively bargain with the employer. Once a bargaining agent is certified by
    the relevant labour board, no other association of employees has any officially
    recognized status. An uncertified association has no right to bargain on behalf
    of workers, or so much as meet with employers to discuss the views of the
    workers they claim to represent. Even individual employees cannot negotiate
    their own terms and conditions of employment but must deal with the employer
    through the certified union.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the exclusive status accorded to the certified bargaining agent,
    labour legislation usually imposes on the agent a duty of fair representation.
    The agent must represent all employees in the unit in a manner that is not
    arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is an important feature of the Wagner model that the employees’ bargaining
    representative be structurally autonomous and independent of the employer. For example,
    it is an unfair labour practice under s. 186(1)(a) of the <i>PSLRA</i> for a
    member of management to “participate in” the formation or administration of an
    employee organization or the representation of employees by an employee
    organization. Even more striking, s. 15 of Ontario’s <i>Labour Relations Act,
    1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sched. A.<i> </i>prohibits the Labour Relations
    Board from certifying a union if an employer has participated in its formation
    or administration, or has contributed financial or other support to it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    can be seen, a Wagner labour regime provides comprehensive affirmative support
    for employees’ ability to organize and collectively engage the employer
    regarding workplace issues. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Wagner model is widely acclaimed and credited with extending “freedom of
    association” and “collective bargaining” to approximately 30 per cent of the
    Canadian workforce, it is not without its detractors. Two criticisms are worth
    noting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Wagner model is sometimes seen as institutionalizing an adversarial tone to
    the labour-management relationship. Carolyn J. Tuohy comments on the
    adversarial nature of the Wagner model in <i>Policy and Politics in Canada:
    Institutionalized Ambivalence</i> (Philadelphia: Temple University Press,
    1992), at p. 164:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Wagner model is essentially one of regulated and delimited
    adversarialism. It thus contrasts with the codetermination models of Germany
    and Sweden, which imply the participation of workers in managerial decision
    making through structures of industrial democracy such as work councils and
    employee representation on corporate boards. Under the Wagner model, labour and
    management recognize each other as legitimate adversaries. Conflict between
    them is to be regulated through agreed-upon rules and structures, which they are
    to respect in “good faith.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    second criticism of the Wagner model is of the majoritarianism/exclusivity
    principle. For example, as Professor Roy Adams has argued, a system that
    prohibits minority unions from representing their members violates the associational
    rights of those minority workers under international law:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he [International Labour Organization]’s position is that if
    workers decide to organize outside of the bounds of statutory majoritarian
    exclusivity, their organizations still ought to be recognized for bargaining
    purposes. In its 2006 Digest of Decisions, the Committee on Freedom of
    Association has this to say: “Where, under a system for nominating an exclusive
    bargaining agent, there is no union representing the required percentage to be
    so designated, collective bargaining rights should be granted to all the unions
    in this unit, at least on behalf of their own members.” On this reasoning,
    employees who want to be represented by minority unions have an international
    human right to bargain collectively, in Canada and elsewhere: Roy J. Adams, “<i>Fraser
    v. Ontario </i>and International Human Rights: A Comment” (2008) 14 Canadian
    Lab. &amp; Emp. L.J. 379, at pp. 383-84.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    criticisms remind us that there is more than one conception of collective bargaining.
    This is important since, as discussed below, the Supreme Court has made it
    abundantly clear that s. 2(d) does not guarantee any particular model of labour
    relations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it takes sustained discipline to apply this principle, since the Wagner
    model so completely pervades our thinking about the meaning of collective
    bargaining and other models are outside our experience. Professor Brian
    Langille put it this way in his article “Why are Canadian Judges Drafting
    Labour Codes – And Constitutionalizing the <i>Wagner Act</i> Model?” (2010) 15
    Canadian Lab. &amp; Emp. L.J. 101, at p. 108:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Canadian labour lawyers have grown up
    in a world where, for as long as any of us can remember, we have instantiated
    freedom of association in the Wagner model, with some Canadian innovations such
    as a mandatory rights arbitration and the no-strike rule during the life of a
    collective agreement. We cannot, it seems, imagine any other way of “doing”
    freedom of association. We are stuck with our own local practices, and have no ability
    to bring to bear any wider or deeper perspective.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>With this background in mind, I now turn to the
    decision under appeal.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DECISION BELOW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    comprehensive review of the application judge’s s. 2(d) analysis is unnecessary
    because he was unable to consider and apply the Supreme Court’s most recent
    decision on s. 2(d), which was released after his decision: <i>Ontario
    (Attorney General) v. Fraser</i>, 2011 SCC 20, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 3. In fact, this
    appeal was delayed pending the release of the Supreme Court’s decision in <span
class=italic><i>Fraser</i></span> so that the parties and this court would have
    the benefit of the latest word from the Supreme Court on the difficult question
    of the proper scope and application of s. 2(d) of the <span class=italic><i>Charter</i></span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    deciding the application, the application judge relied primarily <span
class=italic>on the Supreme Court’s earlier decision in <i>Health Services and
    Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Assn. v. British Columbia</i></span>,
    2007 SCC 27, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 391 (“<span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>B.C.</span></i></span><span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'> Health</span></i></span>”). He also referred to this
    court’s decision in <i>Fraser</i> (<i>Fraser v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i>,
    2008 ONCA 760, 92 O.R. (3d) 481). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge arrived at the legal conclusion at para. 55<i> </i>that<i> </i>the
    members of the RCMP “have a constitutional right to form an independent<i> </i>association
    for labour relations<i> </i>purposes<i>,</i> free of management interference or
    influence” as guaranteed by s. 2(d) of the <i>Charter</i>. He held that s. 96
    of the <i>Regulations</i>, which requires members of the RCMP to interact
    collectively with management regarding labour issues through the SRRP, violates
    s. 2(d) for two reasons. First, the SRRP is not<i> </i>an independent
    association formed or chosen by members of the RCMP. Second, the interaction
    between the SRRP and management is restricted to a process of consultation and cannot
    reasonably be described as a process of collective bargaining. In his view, the
    breach of s. 2(d) cannot be saved by s. 1 as it fails the minimal impairment
    test.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, the application judge relied on a robust conception
    of collective bargaining, rooted in traditional labour practice, which includes
    a process of negotiation based on a comparative equality of bargaining strength
    and in which management does not have the last word. He defined collective
    bargaining at paras. 47-49:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my opinion, while the majority in <i>BC Health Services</i> described the process [of collective bargaining] variously as one of
    “consultation”, “discussion” and “dialogue”, their reasons as a whole make it
    clear that it encompasses more than simple consultation. For example, they
    stated that the process cannot be reduced to a mere right to make
    representations, and that “the duty to consult <i>and</i> negotiate in good
    faith” is “the fundamental precept of collective bargaining”.<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'> </span></sup><u>It is <span class=Underline>difficult
    to conceive of as a negotiation, let alone as bargaining, a process in which
    employees can make no offer to management of a quid pro quo because management
    can have the quid regardless of whether it surrenders the quo</span></u><i>.</i></p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is instructive that the majority adopted the definition of
    collective bargaining offered by Professor Bora Laskin (as he then was):</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Collective bargaining is the
    procedure through which the views of the workers are made known, expressed
    through representatives chosen by them, not through representatives selected or
    nominated or approved by employers. <i>More than that</i>, it is a procedure
    through which terms and conditions of employment may be settled <u>by
    negotiations between an employer and his employees on the basis of a
    comparative equality of bargaining strength</u><i>.</i> </p>
  <p class=CQuote>While the first sentence of that definition might describe a
    process of consultation, the second demonstrates that something more is
    required. If one side can unilaterally determine the outcome of the ‘negotiations’,
    it can hardly be said that there is a comparative equality of bargaining strength.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also concluded that the exclusion of RCMP members from the <span
class=italic><i>PSLRA</i></span> by virtue of s. 2(1)(d) of that Act does not
    violate s. 2(d) of the <span class=italic>Charter</span>. He relied on the
    Supreme Court’s decision in <span class=italic><i>Delisle v. Canada (Deputy
    Attorney General)</i></span>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 989, in which the Supreme Court
    held that the exclusion of RCMP members from the application of the <i>PSLRA</i>’s
    predecessor statute did not violate the s. 2(d) freedom of RCMP members. The
    application judge reasoned that the Supreme Court in <i>Delisle</i> had
    rejected the argument that the exclusion of members of the RCMP from the labour
    relations scheme of the <i>PSLRA</i> infringed s. 2(d) of the Charter, and
    there was no reason to reassess that determination. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge dismissed the remainder of the associations’ claims. He held
    that there was no factual foundation for a consideration of  whether s. 41 of
    the <i>Regulations </i>interferes with the RCMP members’ freedom of expression (under
    s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>) in the context of their freedom of association
    (under s. 2(d) of the <i>Charter</i>). He noted the main concern of the MPAO
    and BCMPPA was the impact of s. 41 on the efforts of RCMP members to exercise
    their associational freedoms. They had conceded before the application judge
    that s. 41 has never been used to interfere with the efforts of RCMP members to
    unionize or engage in collective bargaining. Therefore he found that there was
    an insufficient factual grounding for this claim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the application judge dismissed the claim that the SRRP violates the RCMP
    members’ equality rights under s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em>, as the MPAO and
    the BCMPPA did not show that any failings of the program fall
    disproportionately on s. 15 protected groups. The respondent associations do
    not pursue their s. 15 claim before this court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a remedy, the application judge issued a declaration that s. 96 violates s.
    2(d) and is of no force or effect. As s. 2(1)(d) of the <span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>PSLRA</span></i></span> remained in place, he
    recognized that this declaration would “leave both the members of the RCMP and
    management without a statutory framework within which to identify the
    appropriate representative of the members and to conduct a process of
    collective bargaining”: para. 117. He suggested that Parliament might act to
    provide such a framework but would need time to consider the issue.
    Consequently, he suspended the declaration for a period of 18 months.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General challenges the application judge’s conclusion that s. 96 of
    the <i>Regulations </i>violates s. 2(d) of the <i>Charter</i>. The Attorney
    General relies on the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Fraser</i> for the
    proposition that workers’ s. 2(d)-protected freedom is only breached where there
    is<i> substantial interference</i> with that freedom, such that their
    meaningful pursuit of collective goals is rendered “effectively impossible”.
    The appellant notes that the majority in <span class=italic><i>Fraser </i></span>equates
    substantial interference with a standard of “effective impossibility”. For
    instance, at para. 47, McLachlin C.J. and LeBel J., writing for the majority,
    state that “[i]f it is shown that is impossible to meaningfully exercise the
    right to associate due to substantial interference by a law (or absence of laws
    … ) or by government action, a limit on the exercise of s. 2(d) is established”.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General points out that while the challenged legislation in <span
class=italic><i>Fraser</i></span> required only that the employer listen to
    oral representations and read written representations with implied good faith,
    the Supreme Court nonetheless concluded that the legislation complied with s.
    2(d). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General asserts that the SRRP more than meets what is required by <span

    employee participation in the decision-making process at the national, regional
    and divisional levels of the RCMP. The SRRs are elected by the members of the
    RCMP to provide fair and equitable representation with management and to facilitate
    participation in the development of policies and procedures that affect their employment.
    The Attorney General argues that this process is constitutionally sufficient,
    and the respondents are seeking to constitutionalize the Wagner model.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span

    the Attorney General challenges the respondents’ submissions that s. 2(1)(d) of

    Legal Fund submits that the appeal should be allowed because s. 96 does not
    violate s. 2(d) of the <i>Charter</i>. The SRRP is a legitimate employee
    association that allows RCMP members to voice their concerns, and does not

    for the process of collective bargaining. The associations emphasize that the <i>Fraser</i> majority specifically held at para. 55 that <i>B.C. Health</i> continues to

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, the associations contend that the two rationales for the
    application judge’s decision – that the SRRP is not an independent association
    and that the interaction between the SRRP and management cannot reasonably be
    described as a process of collective bargaining – are not undermined by the <i>Fraser</i> decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the MPAO and the BCMPPA relies on the majority’s statement in <i>Fraser</i> that the right to engage in a process of<i> </i>collective bargaining is
    derivative of the employees’ freedom to form and maintain an association. This
    means that the process of collective bargaining does not come into play until
    after the employees have formed an association. First, the employees form an
    association, and then it is the association itself that asserts the collective
    right to engage in collective bargaining. The employees’ freedom of association
    cannot be severed from<i> </i>the association they have chosen and grafted onto

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span

    submits that the Attorney General’s position that the SRRP is a
    constitutionally adequate form of collective bargaining must be rejected.<i> </i>The
    SRRP is not a genuine employee association, freely chosen by the employees, but
    a branch of the RCMP imposed on them. Moreover, it is not independent from
    management. Though SRRP representatives are elected by R<span style='line-height:

    independence: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The SRRP is a program within the RCMP, not an employee

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second leg of the respondents’ argument is that the SRRP does not engage in
    collective bargaining. On their reading of the majority decision in <span
class=italic>Fraser</span>, which affirms <span class=italic><i>B.C. Health</i></span>,
    collective bargaining involves more than an opportunity to consult. The
    respondents point to several passages from the majority’s decision in<i> Fraser </i>to support this view, including paras. 37 and 38: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Applying the principles of interpretation established in <i>Dunmore</i>,
    a majority of the Court [in <i>B.C. Heath</i>] held that s. 2(d) includes “a
    process of collective action to achieve workplace goals” (para. 19). This
    process requires the parties <i>to meet and bargain in good faith</i> on issues
    of fundamental importance in the workplace (para. 90). </p>
  <p class=CQuote>… The claimants had a right to pursue workplace goals and <i>collective
    bargaining activities</i> related to those goals. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    associations point out that, at para. 40, the majority in <i>Fraser</i> reiterated that <i>B.C. Health </i>had affirmed that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>bargaining activities protected by s. 2(d) in the labour
    relations context include good faith bargaining on important workplace issues
    (para. 94; see also paras. 93, 130 and 135). This is not limited to a mere
    right to make representations to one’s employer, but requires the employer to
    engage in a process of consideration and discussion to have them considered by

    respondents rely on the fact that the <span class=italic><i>Fraser</i></span> majority reiterates para. 90 of <i>B.C. Health</i>, at para. 40 of <i>Fraser</i>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Thus the employees’ right to collective bargaining imposes
    corresponding duties on the employer. It requires both employer and employees
    to meet and to bargain in good faith, in the pursuit of a common goal of
    peaceful and productive accommodation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    emphasize that, at para. 50, the <span class=italic><i>Fraser</i></span> majority disagrees with the more narrow reading of <i>B.C. Health </i>proposed
    by Deschamps J.: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>If s. 2(d) merely protected the right to act collectively and
    to make collective representations, the legislation at issue in that case would
    have been constitutional. The legislation in that case violated s. 2(d) since
    it undermined the ability of workers to engage in meaningful collective
    bargaining, which the majority defined as good faith negotiations….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span

    respondents also note that, in responding to the dissenting reasons of
    Rothstein J., the <i>Fraser</i> majority states at para. 95: “‘[T]he principle
    that employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith and endeavour to
    reach an agreement’” was “precisely the general principle that [<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the associations claim that they have, on behalf of their members, more than

    that the case turns on the constitutionally protected freedom of the members of
    the RCMP to form independent voluntary associations without interference. It
    contends, relying on <i>Delisle</i>, that the application judge effectively
    found that the establishment of the SRRP and its continued existence is an

    employer, s. 2(d) “protects RCMP members against any interference by management
    in the establishment of an employee association.” Bastarache J. adds, at para.
    32: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>If<span style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span>RCMP management has

    any other party with standing to challenge these practices directly by relying

    In oral argument, counsel referred to the long history of anti-union activity by
    RCMP management described by the minority judges in <i>Delisle</i> (beginning
    at para. 104). This “union busting” activity would constitute an unfair labour
    practice in any legislated labour regime, such as a Wagner-style regime. In a legislated
    labour regime, the SRRP could not be certified as the bargaining agent because it
    would be regarded as a “company union”. In the AMPMQ’s submission, s. 96 of the <i>Regulations</i> should be struck down as an unfair labour practice that

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    previously noted, <i>Delisle</i> also concerned the s. 2(d) freedom of RCMP
    members. Mr. Delisle was the president of the intervener AMPMQ. He brought an
    application attacking the provision in the <i>PSSRA</i> (the predecessor to the
    current <i>PSLRA</i>) that expressly excluded RCMP members from the <span
class=italic><i>PSSRA</i></span> labour relations regime. He also challenged
    the provision of the <i>Canada Labour Code</i>, R.S.C., 1985, c. L-2 that
    provided that it did not apply to public service employees. He argued that the
    purpose or effect of these provisions was to interfere with RCMP members’
    freedom to associate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court held that s. 2(d) does not give RCMP members the right to
    establish a particular type of association defined in a particular statute.
    Section 2(d) does not require that RCMP members be included in the <i>PSSRA</i> or any other legislative regime. What s. 2(d) does guarantee is “the
    establishment of an independent employee association and the exercise in
    association of the lawful rights of its members”: <i>Delisle</i>, at para. 12. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the Supreme Court also noted that s. 2(d) protects RCMP members from management
    interference in the establishment of an independent employee association. If
    RCMP management uses unfair labour practices to interfere with the creation of an
    employee association, it would be open to an RCMP member “to challenge these
    practices directly by relying on s. 2(d), as the RCMP is part of the government
    within the meaning of s. 32(1) of the Charter”: <i>Delisle</i>, at para. 32.</p>

    2001 decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Dunmore</i> concernd the exclusion of
    agricultural<i> </i>workers from Ontario’s statutory labour relations regime.
    Except for a brief period after the enactment of the <i>Agricultural Labour
    Relations Act, 1994</i>, S.O. 1994, c. 6, agricultural workers in Ontario have
    historically been excluded from the labour relations regime generally available
    to workers. The <i>Labour Relations and Employment Statute Law Amendment Act,
    1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 1, repealed the <i>Agricultural Labour Relations Act</i>,
    and s. 3(b) of Ontario’s <i>Labour Relations Act </i>excluded agricultural

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants in <i>Dunmore, </i>who were farm workers and union organizers, argued

    large portion of the majority’s reasons, written by Bastarache J., address the
    agricultural workers’ claim that s. 2(d) obligated the government to provide
    them with a protective regime to enable them to effectively exercise their
    associational freedoms in their relationships with private employers. The court
    concludes that in the circumstances facing the agricultural workers in <i>Dunmore</i>,
    s. 2(d) gives the workers the right to be included within a protective regime.</p>

    para. 26, that <i>Dunmore</i> “raised the question of whether s. 2(d) requires

    impossible”: <i>Fraser</i>, at para. 31. Bastarache J. “found that the absence
    of legislative support discredited the organizing efforts of agricultural
    workers and had a chilling effect on their constitutional right to associate”
    and he “concluded that farm workers in Ontario were substantially incapable of
    exercising their fundamental freedom to associate without a protective regime”: <i>Fraser</i>, at para. 31. The absence of legislative protection for
    associational activity made it “impossible” to achieve workplace goals and
    constituted “substantial interference” with the workers’ freedom of association
    as guaranteed by s. 2(d): <i>Fraser</i>, at para. 47.</p>

    provide the “minimum” statutory protections required to enable agricultural
    workers to exercise their right to bargain collectively in a meaningful way.
    The Court of Appeal held that the Act does not meet the requirements of s. 2(d)
    of the <i>Charter</i> because it fails to provide three protections: (1) a
    statutory duty to bargain in good faith; (2) statutory protection for
    majoritarian/exclusivity, meaning that each bargaining unit would be represented
    by a single bargaining agent; and (3) a mechanism to resolve bargaining
    impasses and interpret collective agreements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    divided Supreme Court allowed the appeal, holding that the <span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>AEPA</span></i></span> satisfies the requirements of s.
    2(d) of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
    in its reasons, at para. 18, the majority articulates the issue in the case: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The ultimate question is whether s. 2(d), properly understood
    and applied, requires the Ontario legislature to provide a particular form of
    collective bargaining rights to agricultural workers, in order to secure the
    effective exercise of their associational rights.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>In contrast with <span class=italic><i>B.C. Health</i></span>,
    where the workers sought protection from legislative interference, the farm
    workers in <span class=italic><i>Fraser</i></span> sought affirmative
    government action to safeguard their associational activities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the majority, the <span class=italic><i><span style='color:windowtext'>AEPA</span></i></span> does not substantially interfere with the ability of farm workers to achieve
    workplace goals through collective actions so as to have the effect of negating
    their freedom of association. Accordingly, the <span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>AEPA</span></i></span> does not constitute a limit on s.
    2(d)’s guarantee of freedom of association. The Act provides for the required
    “process of engagement that permits employee associations to make
    representations to employers, which employers must consider and discuss in good
    faith”: para. 2.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Fraser</i> majority concludes that the Court of Appeal overstated the ambit
    of the s. 2(d) right, by misreading <i>B.C. Health</i>’s<i> </i>affirmation of
    the right to collective bargaining as constitutionalizing a full-blown <i>Wagner
    Act</i> system. The court in <i>B.C. Health </i>had “unequivocally stated that
    s. 2(d) does not guarantee <i>a particular model of collective bargaining or a
    particular outcome</i>”: <i>Fraser</i>, at para. 45 (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    majority reiterates that what s. 2(d) protects is the freedom to associate to
    achieve collective goals. Section 2(d) protects collective bargaining in a <i>derivative</i> sense, as the majority describes at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Laws or government action that <span
class=Underline>make it impossible to achieve collective goals</span> <i>have
    the effect</i> of limiting freedom of association, by making it pointless. It
    is in this derivative sense that s. 2(d) protects a right to collective
    bargaining: see <i>Ontario (Public Safety and Security) v. Criminal Lawyers’
    Association</i>, 2010 SCC 23, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 815 (“<i>CLA</i>”), where the
    right to access government information was held to be “a derivative right which
    may arise where it is a necessary precondition of meaningful expression on the
    functioning of government” (para. 30). However, no particular type of
    bargaining is protected. In every case, the question is whether the impugned
    law or state action has <span class=Underline>the effect of making it
    impossible to act collectively to achieve workplace goals.</span> [Italics in
    original; underlining added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority explains, at para. 47, what <i>B.C. Health </i>did not decide: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[B.C. Health] does not support the
    view … that legislatures are constitutionally required, in all cases and for
    all industries, to enact laws that set up a uniform model of labour relations
    imposing a statutory duty to bargain in good faith, statutory recognition of
    the principles of exclusive majority representation and a statutory mechanism
    for resolving bargaining impasses and disputes regarding the interpretation or
    administration of collective agreements. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather,
    what is protected “is associational activity, not a particular process or result”: <i>Fraser</i>, at para. 47. In order to establish a breach of s. 2(d), it must
    be shown that it is <i>impossible</i> to meaningfully exercise the freedom to
    associate due to substantial interference by government action, as in <i>B.C.
    Health</i>,<i> </i>or absence of government action, as in <i>Dunmore</i>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    these principles, the question in <i>Fraser</i> was whether the legislative
    scheme rendered association in pursuit of workplace goals <i>impossible</i>,
    thereby substantially impairing the exercise of the s. 2(d) associational freedom.
    The majority repeats this question in slightly different terms at para. 98,
    asking whether the <span class=italic><i><span style='color:windowtext'>AEPA</span></i></span><span
class=italic><span style='color:windowtext'> </span></span>process, viewed in
    terms of its effect, “makes good faith resolution of workplace issues between
    employees and their employer <i>effectively impossible</i>” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority notes that the <span class=italic><i><span style='color:windowtext'>AEPA</span></i></span><i> </i>gives employee associations the right to make representations to their
    employers, and provides that employers shall listen to oral representations,
    read written representations and acknowledge having read them. Further, the <span
class=italic><i><span style='color:windowtext'>AEPA</span></i></span> implicitly
    requires employers to consider employee representations in good faith.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the <span class=italic><i><span style='color:windowtext'>AEPA</span></i></span>,
    correctly interpreted, protects not only the right of employees to make
    submissions to employers on workplace matters, but also the right to have those
    submissions considered in good faith by the employer, it follows that it does
    not violate s. 2(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    would like to highlight one aspect of the <span class=italic><i>Fraser</i></span> decision that sheds light on the nature of the s. 2(d) right to bargain
    collectively. The majority in <i>Fraser</i>, at para. 46, states that s. 2(d)
    protects the right to collective bargaining in a “derivative sense”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    understand what the Supreme Court means by a derivative right, we must return
    first to <i>Delisle.</i> At para. 26, Bastarache J. points out that “s. 2 [of
    the <i>Charter</i>] generally imposes a negative obligation on the government
    and not a positive obligation of protection or assistance.” He draws an analogy
    to freedom of expression, echoing the court’s remark in <i>Haig v. Canada, </i>[1993]
    2 S.C.R. 995, at p. 1035, that “the freedom of expression contained in s. 2(b)
    prohibits gags, but does not compel the distribution of megaphones.” He notes,
    however, that in <i>Haig</i>, the court did leave open the possibility that “a
    situation might arise in which, in order to make a fundamental freedom
    meaningful, a posture of restraint would not be enough, and positive
    governmental action might be required”: <i>Haig</i>, at p. 1039. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bastarache J.
    concludes that “except perhaps in exceptional circumstances, freedom of
    expression requires only that Parliament not interfere. In my view, the same is
    true for freedom of association”: <i>Delisle</i>, at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The majority in <i>Fraser</i> carries the analogy to freedom of expression further, by
    referring to <i>Ontario (Public Safety and Security) v. Criminal Lawyers’
    Association</i>, 2010 SCC 23, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 815 (“<span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>CLA</span></i></span>”) to explain the nature of a
    derivative right. In <i>CLA</i>, the court introduces the term “derivative
    right” to <i>Charter</i> jurisprudence, and I find it of immense assistance in
    understanding the concept. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>CLA</i> case has an interesting context. Glithero J. stayed a prosecution
    for the murder of Domenic Racco, finding at p. 300:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>many instances of abusive conduct by state
    officials involving deliberate non-disclosure, deliberate editing of useful
    information, negligent breach of the duty to maintain original evidence,
    improper cross-examination and jury addresses during the first trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These findings
    led to an investigation by the Ontario Provincial Police (“OPP”) of potential
    police misconduct. The OPP’s report exonerated the police of any wrongdoing,
    and its report was not made public. The CLA requested the report under the<span

    by the Minister who refused to disclose the report. The CLA argued that its
    freedom of expression was infringed because its ability to make public comment
    was hampered by not knowing the content of the report. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=verdana>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Supreme Court dismissed the bulk of the CLA’s claim, and
    concluded that s. 2<span class=verdana>(</span><span class=italic>b</span><span
class=verdana>) of the <i>Charter</i> guarantees freedom of expression, not
    access to information: <i>CLA</i>, at para. 30. However, McLachlin C.J. and
    Abella J., writing for the court, did not completely close the door on the <i>Charter</i> providing a right of access to government information. They comment at para. 30
    that “[a]ccess is a derivative right which may arise <i>where it is a necessary

    (emphasis added). At para. 31, they conclude </span><span class=Heading1Char><span

  <p class=CQuote><span class=verdana>To demonstrate that there is expressive

class=verdana>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=verdana>The court concludes at paras. 37 and 38: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In sum, there is a <span

    may require disclosure of documents in government hands where it is shown that,
    without the desired access, meaningful public discussion and criticism on
    matters of public interest would be <i>substantially impeded</i>. As Louis D.
    Brandeis famously wrote in his 1913 article in <span class=italic><i>Harper’s
    Weekly</i></span> entitled “What Publicity Can Do”: “Sunlight is said to be the
    best of disinfectants....” Open government requires that the citizenry be
    granted access to government records when it is necessary to meaningful public
    debate on the conduct of government institutions.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If this <i>necessity</i> is established, a <span class=italic><i>prima

    public discussion of the handling of the investigation into the murder of
    Domenic Racco and the prosecution of those suspected of the murder could take
    place without disclosure of the OPP’s report. The CLA had not established that
    disclosure was “necessary for meaningful public discussion of the problems in
    the administration of justice relating to the Racco murder”: para. 59. The CLA,
    while unable to comment on the content of the report itself, could exercise its

    the right arises only in circumstances where it is a “necessary precondition”
    to the exercise of the fundamental freedom itself. McLachlin C.J. and Abella J.
    describe the derivative right in para. 30 as one that “may arise”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme
    Court in <i>Fraser </i>draws on the analogy of a derivative right to access
    information, as described in <i>CLA</i>, to define the parameters of when
    positive government action is required to support the freedom of association,
    at para. 70: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>A purposive protection of freedom of association may require
    the state <i>to act positively</i> to protect the ability of individuals to
    engage in fundamentally important collective activities, just as a purposive

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span

    right, a positive obligation to engage in good faith collective bargaining will
    only be imposed on an employer when it is effectively impossible for the

  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Does s. 96 of the <i>Regulations</i> violate s. 2(d)? </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    respondents’ formulation, their members are seeking positive measures to enable
    them to exercise their freedom of association. As affirmed by <i>Delisle</i>, RCMP
    members have the freedom to establish, join and maintain an independent
    employee association of their choice and to exercise in association the lawful rights
    of its members. Members of those associations are able to collectively convey
    representations about workplace issues to their employer. The employer,
    however, refuses to recognize the associations they have formed and ignores any
    representations they make through their associations. The essence of the
    associations’ position is that their freedom of association is effectively
    useless unless their employer is under a positive obligation to recognize and
    to engage in “collective bargaining” with the associations. They seek to have a
    positive obligation placed on the employer to recognize and “collectively
    bargain” with them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the
    members of the associations are employed by the state, the associations need
    not argue that the government is constitutionally bound to impose the positive
    obligation on the employer by statute. The positive obligation of their
    government employer to engage in “collective bargaining” with them, if it
    exists, stems directly from the constitution. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with two
    observations about the associations’ claim that s. 2(d) imposes on their
    employer a positive obligation to engage in “collective bargaining”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the
    associations embrace an expansive concept of the constitutionally guaranteed
    right to “collective bargaining”. Their position is that once employees have
    formed an independent association to engage in collective bargaining, s. 2(d)
    gives them the right to negotiate with the employer on the basis of
    comparatively equal bargaining power. In their view, the Supreme Court’s
    jurisprudence leaves it open for them to argue that s. 2(d) guarantees a
    mechanism to break deadlocks in negotiations between the independently formed
    association and the employer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the associations
    acknowledges that the result of accepting their claim is that any combination
    of employees who choose to form an association will have the same collective
    right, and the employer will be obliged to “negotiate” with each and every
    association formed. Counsel recognizes this would lead to unwieldy labour
    relations but suggests that the government could step in and enact a
    legislative regime that provides for majoritarianism/exclusivity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not regard
    the solution as that simple. If the associations’ position is accepted, a
    legislative regime providing for majoritarianism/exclusivity would itself run
    counter to s. 2(d), since it would deny all minority associations the right to engage
    in “collective bargaining” as conceived by the associations. One commentator
    has interpreted the jurisprudence in this fashion. Professor Roy Adams argues
    that, following <i>B.C. Health</i>, “public sector workers who have not yet
    organized now apparently have a constitutional right to form minority unions
    and have them recognized by their government employers for bargaining purposes”:
    “Prospects for Labour’s Rights to Bargain Collectively After <i>B.C. Health
    Services</i>” (2009) 59 U.N.B. L.J. 85, at p. 89.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I do not accept
    that the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court<i> </i>lead to the result
    that Wagner model labour regimes are <span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>prima facie</span></i></span> unconstitutional and
    would have to be justified under s. 1. In my view, had the Supreme Court
    intended to de-constitutionalize the predominant form of collective bargaining
    in Canada, it would have done so unambiguously. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event,
    the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence makes clear that the associations’ conception
    of the content of “collective bargaining” is too expansive.  In my view, the Supreme
    Court has established that the content of the constitutionally guaranteed right
    to “collective bargaining” is narrower than how that term is used in Wagner
    model regimes.  “Collective bargaining” under s. 2(d) protects only the right
    to make collective representations and to have those collective representations
    considered in good faith.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, “collective
    bargaining” under s. 2(d) is a derivative right. A government employer is
    obligated to engage in “collective bargaining” under s. 2(d) only when the
    employees are able to claim the derivative right under s. 2(d). They are able
    to claim that derivative right upon showing that the exercise of the
    fundamental freedom of association is “effectively impossible”. Only where the
    “core protection of s. 2(d) ... to act in association with others to pursue
    common objectives and goals” (<i>Fraser</i>, at para. 25) cannot be meaningfully
    exercised does the derivative right arise. As s. 2(d) does not
    constitutionalize minority unions, the test of “effective impossibility” is
    applied to the workers at large, and not to any particular combination of
    workers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the
    test in that way, I conclude that it is not effectively impossible for RCMP
    members to meaningfully exercise their fundamental freedom under s. 2(d). I
    reach that conclusion for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, RCMP members
    have been able to form the voluntary associations before the court in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme
    Court has already indicated that the ability of RCMP members to form voluntary
    associations is significant and sets RCMP members apart from, for example,
    relatively disempowered agricultural workers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Delisle</i>,
    Bastarache J. remarks, at para. 31, that the fact that RCMP members have formed
    voluntary independent associations shows that they are not prevented from doing
    so: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]t is difficult to argue that the exclusion of RCMP members
    from the statutory regime of the <i>PSSRA</i> prevents the establishment of an
    independent employee association because RCMP members have in fact formed such
    an association in several provinces.... </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunmore</i>,
    Bastarache J. refers back to <i>Delisle</i> and contrasts RCMP members with
    agricultural workers. Agricultural workers were unable to form employee
    associations in provinces that denied them protection. He lists the
    distinguishing features of agricultural workers: political impotence; lack of
    resources to associate without state protection; vulnerability to reprisal by
    employers; poor pay; difficult working conditions; low levels of skill and
    education; low status; and limited employment mobility: <i>Dunmore</i>, at
    para. 41. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By contrast,
    Bastarache J. links RCMP officers’ ability to associate to their “relative
    status”, comparing them to “the armed forces, senior executives in the public
    service and judges”: para. 45. The exclusion of RCMP members from the labour
    regime of the <i>PSSRA</i> could not discourage RCMP members from associating
    “in light of their relative status, their financial resources and their access
    to constitutional protection”: para. 45. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority in <i>B.C.
    Health</i> referred to Bastarache J.’s analysis in <i>Delisle</i>. At para. 35,
    the majority observed that Bastarache J. had reconciled the imposition of a
    positive obligation on government in <i>Dunmore</i> with the result in <i>Delisle</i>,
    in which no positive obligation was imposed. He had done so “by distinguishing
    the effects of the legislation in the two cases. Unlike the RCMP members in <i>Delisle</i>,
    farm workers faced barriers that made them <i>substantially incapable</i> of
    exercising their right to form associations outside the statutory framework”: <i>B.C.
    Health</i>, at para. 35 (emphasis in original). In my view this is enough to
    dispose of this issue: the Supreme Court has already decided that it is not
    effectively impossible for RCMP members to exercise their fundamental freedom
    of association guaranteed by s. 2(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second
    reason for concluding that it is not effectively impossible for RCMP members to
    act collectively to achieve workplace goals is the existence of the SRRP. The
    SRRP was criticized by the associations, who devoted much of their argument to
    distinguishing the SRRP from “<span lang=EN-US>a labour relations model of
    independent representation and collective bargaining.” No doubt the SRRP lacks
    the attributes of a Wagner model bargaining representative. T</span>he SRRP is
    not institutionally independent. The RCMP members have never had the
    opportunity to choose a bargaining agent in a Wagner labour regime, and the
    SRRP is created by regulation (though the formation of its predecessor, the
    DSRR, was endorsed in a referendum). The question at this stage, though, is not
    whether the SRRP should be regarded as an adequate alternative to a collective
    bargaining agent in the traditional “labour relations model”. Rather, the
    question is whether the legislative framework makes it effectively impossible for
    the workers to act collectively to pursue workplace issues in a meaningful way. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SRRs elected
    by the RCMP membership are included in all important management processes. Two
    SRRs attend all meetings of the RCMP’s Senior Management Team. SRRs attend
    divisional management meetings. Two SRRs, along with two representatives of
    management and an impartial chair, make up the Pay Council.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application
    judge’s findings of fact make it unnecessary to reprise the description of the
    SRRP in paras. 13-19 above. The application judge found that there was
    extensive collaboration between SRRs and management that was carried out in
    good faith by everyone involved. He accepted, at para. 68, that “RCMP
    management listens carefully and with an open mind to the views of SRRs in the
    consultative process established by the SRRP.” There is no reason to interfere
    with that finding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extensive
    collaboration between the elected SRRs and management shows that it is not
    impossible for the RCMP members to associate to achieve collective goals. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third reason
    I conclude that the exercise of the fundamental freedom of association by RCMP
    members is not “effectively impossible” is the existence of the Legal Fund. As
    noted above, the Legal Fund is a voluntary not-for-profit corporation. Some
    14,000 RCMP members have joined the Fund and some 100 additional members join each
    month. It was established to help its members with various employment-related
    issues. It assists RCMP members by acting to advance their dignity and welfare,
    in relation to matters arising under RCMP policies and directives. It is funded
    exclusively by the dues of its members, and is entirely self-governed,
    independent and autonomous, with independent, democratically elected directors
    and officers. The Legal Fund plays a role that is complementary to, and
    supportive of, the SRRP.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents
    submit the Legal Fund is a “smart and adaptive” way of trying to deal with the
    shortcomings of the SRRP. For example, the SRRP (as a program of the RCMP) must
    use the legal services of the Department of Justice. The Legal Fund is able to
    provide private legal representation to RCMP members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the Legal
    Fund expends some funds in ways that the respondents consider inappropriate is
    neither here nor there. The point is that the formation and maintenance of such
    a robust association by RCMP members and the functions it performs support the
    conclusion it is not effectively impossible for RCMP members to exercise their
    fundamental freedom of association in relation to workplace issues.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these
    reasons, I conclude that it is not effectively impossible for RCMP members to act
    collectively to achieve workplace goals. It follows that the respondent
    associations’ members are unable to claim the derivative right to collective
    bargaining under s. 2(d). Accordingly, there is no constitutional obligation on
    the government to take positive action, in the sense discussed in <i>Haig</i>, <i>Delisle</i>, <i>CLA</i> and <i>Dunmore</i>, to facilitate the exercise of the RCMP members’ s.
    2(d)-protected freedom. There is no “necessary precondition” for placing a positive
    obligation on the employer to recognize and “negotiate” with the respondent associations
    in order to make meaningful association possible for their members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conclusion
    that the members of the respondent associations cannot claim the derivative
    right to collective bargaining renders the principal concerns of the
    application judge immaterial. He considered the inability of RCMP members to
    form an independent association “for the purpose of collectively bargaining” to
    be the principal source of the infringement of s. 2(d). As <i>Delisle</i> establishes, RCMP members do have the freedom to form independent employee
    associations. The additional guidance provided by <i>Fraser </i>indicates their
    ability to associate is not so ineffective that they are able to claim the
    derivative right to collectively bargain. The constitutional right to form an
    independent association for the purpose of collective bargaining, if it exists,
    would be a facet of the derivative right to collective bargaining and does not
    arise in this case.   </p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Is s. 96 an unfair
    labour practice? </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    formulation of the AMPMQ, this case involves the active interference of the
    government with the freedom of association of RCMP members. The AMPMQ argues
    that the application judge found, in effect, that s. 96 of the <i>Regulations</i> and the historical actions of RCMP management constitute unfair labour
    practices that prevent RCMP members from being able to organize an effective
    voluntary association. The application judge, in describing the evolution of
    the SRRP, noted the government and the Commissioner’s history of opposing the
    unionization of RCMP members.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application
    judge did not use the term “unfair labour practice”. However, accepting for the
    sake of argument that the application judge did, in effect, find that the
    government engaged in unfair labour practices, it is my view he erred in making
    that finding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without the
    benefit of the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Fraser</i>, the application judge
    proceeded with an inflated view of the content of “collective bargaining”
    protected by s. 2(d). He did not appreciate the derivative nature of the right,
    and he brought to bear values from the Wagner model. His conception of the
    constitutionally required attributes of an employee association would preclude
    models of employee relations that bring employees into the decision making
    structures in a non-adversarial, collaborative fashion. Such alternative models
    of employer-employee relations are widely used in other industrial democracies.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event,
    the AMPMQ’s claim ultimately devolves into the same claim as that brought by the
    respondent associations. A constitutionally protected right must exist before
    practices can be found to unfairly interfere with it. If the associations have
    no constitutional right to demand that RCMP management recognize and negotiate
    with them, practices that hinder them from doing so cannot rise to the level of
    constitutional violations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The AMPMQ’s
    formulation of s. 2(d) must be rejected for the same reasons as the MPAO and
    the BCMPPA’s formulation. </p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Does the exclusion of
    the RCMP from the <i>PSLRA</i> violate s. 2(d) of the <em>Charter</em>? (The
    Cross-Appeal)</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cross-appeal
    of the application judge’s conclusion that the exclusion of the RCMP from the <i>PSLRA</i> does not violate s. 2(d) of the <em>Charter </em>must be dismissed on the same
    analysis set out above. As it is not effectively impossible for RCMP members to
    associate collectively to achieve workplace goals, there is no positive
    obligation on the government to include them in the labour regime set out in
    the <i>PSLRA</i>. Moreover, the Supreme Court has already addressed the constitutionality
    of the RCMP members’ exclusion from the <i>PSSRA</i>, the predecessor to the <i>PSLRA</i>,
    in <i>Delisle</i>.</p>
  <h1>H.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2(b): The <i>Charter</i>’<i>s </i>Guarantee of Freedom of
    Expression</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The associations
    appeal from the application judge’s dismissal of their claim that s. 41 of the <i>Regulations </i>violates s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. Section 41 states: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>A member shall not publicly criticize, ridicule, petition or
    complain about the administration, operation, objectives or policies of the
    Force, unless authorized by law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As the application
    judge noted, at para. 104, the respondents “confined their challenge to s. 41
    to a particular context, namely its impact on the efforts of RCMP members to
    exercise their associational freedoms. Their factum, as well, made it clear
    that ss. 2(d) was their real concern.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this context,
    the application judge found that there was an inadequate factual foundation to
    consider this claim because the RCMP has chosen not to use s. 41 to discipline
    its members in the labour relations context, and because insufficient evidence
    was adduced by the associations to demonstrate the effect of s. 41 on the
    freedom of expression. He concluded that in the context in which it was
    challenged, the “constitutionality of s. 41 of the <span class=italic><i><span
style='color:windowtext'>Regulations</span></i></span> ought not to be
    considered in the abstract”: para. 107.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the cross-appellants
    seek to advance a general attack on s. 41 as violating the s. 2(b) freedom of
    expression of RCMP members. They argue that “[t]he violation of 2(b) is self
    evident – the purpose of the provision is to curtail speech which the
    government considers might be harmful or embarrassing to the force.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view,
    having initially confined their attack on s. 41 to its impact on their members’<span
lang=EN-US> associational freedoms, the cross-appellants cannot mount a general
    challenge to s. 41 for the first time in this court. I see no error in the </span>application
    judge’s disposition of the issue that was placed before him. I would not
    interfere with his decision.</p>
  <h1>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CONCLUSION </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these
    reasons, I would allow the Attorney General’s appeal and set aside the
    application judge’s declaration that s. 96 of the <i>Regulations </i>violates
    the s. 2(d) <i>Charter</i> rights of RCMP members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[149]<span
