  <p class=Judge>By the Court:</p>
  <h2>I.        Background</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a judge alone trial, the appellant was convicted of breaking and
    entering, aggravated sexual assault, attempt murder, unlawful confinement and
    threatening death.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
    He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first three counts and five years
    imprisonment on the last two counts, to be served concurrently.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals against sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his factum, the appellant argued that the sentencing judge erred in
    imposing a life sentence after the Crown withdrew its dangerous offender
    application.  The appellant maintained that the sentencing judges assessment
    of his future dangerousness and of the associated need for protection of the
    public formed the primary basis for the imposition of a life sentence and that,
    absent a dangerous offender application, it was not open to the sentencing
    judge to sentence the appellant to life imprisonment on this basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, during oral argument, the appellants counsel clarified that he
    does not challenge the potential availability of life imprisonment as an
    appropriate sentence for the crimes at issue in this case, even where, as here,
    no dangerous or long-term offender designation was sought by the Crown. 
    Rather, he contends that, given the circumstances of these offences and this
    offender, a sentence of life imprisonment is unjustified and unfit.</p>
  <h2>II.       Discussion</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the sentencing judge made no error in principle in his
    sentencing analysis and the sentence imposed is fit.  We say this for the
    following reasons.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We begin with the circumstances of these offences.  Simply put, they were
    horrific.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant, a 76 year-old woman, was asleep alone in her apartment
    when the appellant, then 26 years of age, broke into her residence in the
    middle of the night.  The complainant awoke to find the appellant standing in
    her apartment.  He was armed with a knife and threatened the complainant that
    if she screamed and did not comply with his demand for sex, he would kill her. 
    When the complainant tried to telephone for help, the appellant cut the phone cord,
    struck the complainants hand with the knife, forced the complainant onto her
    bed, groped her, digitally penetrated her vagina, forced her to engage in vaginal
    intercourse, and then attempted to vaginally penetrate her from behind.  While
    all this was occurring, the appellant stabbed the complainant three times in
    the abdomen, slashed her face (cutting all the way to the jaw bone), and
    brutally beat her.  One of the inflicted wounds was potentially fatal.  In
    addition, the complainant lost approximately one-eighth of her total blood
    supply and sustained multiple cuts to her face and hands during the appellants
    attack, which later required surgical repair.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant persisted in his attack notwithstanding the complainants
    repeated pleas that he stop and the fact that she was bleeding profusely.  The
    attack lasted in excess of one hour.  The appellant left only when the
    complainant managed to escape to her apartment balcony, where she called out
    for help.  This prompted the appellant to flee from the apartment, leaving his
    clothes behind.  When the complainant re-entered her apartment and called 911,
    the appellant returned, gathered up his clothing and eventually fled the
    apartment again.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge reviewed the circumstances of the offences in
    detail, including the understandably traumatic effects on the victim and
    members of her family.  He concluded that, The sexual nature of the attack was
    quite degrading and constituted an extreme violation of [the complainants]
    privacy, security and dignity.  The attack involved gratuitous and excessive
    violence well beyond anything necessary to [obtain the complainants]
    compliance.  We agree with this description of the nature and gravity of the
    offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge was cognizant of the Crowns withdrawal of its dangerous
    offender application, necessitated by the appellants refusal to participate in
    a psychiatric assessment.  The sentencing judge expressly stated, I certainly
    will not impose a life sentence because this dangerous offender application was
    abandoned.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge heard almost a full day of submissions by counsel on the issue
    whether a life sentence or a lengthy determinate sentence was appropriate.  His
    comprehensive reasons reveal a careful and thorough consideration of all the
    aggravating and mitigating factors relevant to the fashioning of a proper
    sentence in this case and reflect no error in principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note, in particular, that the sentencing judge had regard to the appellants
    circumstances and antecedents and factored them into his sentencing calculus. 
    He noted the appellants age; that the appellant was a first (although not a
    youthful) offender; that his past conduct suggested that he has the capacity to
    act responsibly; that he enjoys a supportive family and had not been in
    trouble while incarcerated; and that there was no evidence that he had ever
    engaged in such a violent crime in the past.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the sentencing judge also held that the appellants family members are
    woefully deficient historians who were unable to reliably portray the
    appellants true character; the appellants attack was a random crime of
    opportunity; the victim of the attack was a vulnerable old lady; and the
    appellants crime demonstrated a callous lack of empathy.  These were all
    relevant and proper sentencing considerations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    identifying the applicable aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the
    sentencing judge undertook a lengthy review of the governing sentencing
    principles, set out in the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  He also addressed, in some
    detail, the approach to be taken in sentencing first offenders (including for
    very serious, violent offences) and the principles relevant to the imposition
    of a life sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    connection with the latter principles, the sentencing judge explicitly
    addressed the defence submission that a life sentence should not be imposed in
    the absence of supporting psychiatric evidence of both continuing dangerousness
    and the limited likelihood for successful treatment.  He also took account of
    the defence contentions that the imposition of a life sentence would be to
    overreach and that protection of the public should not trump all other
    sentencing objectives.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as we have mentioned, the appellant declined to participate in a
    forensic psychiatric assessment, thereby depriving the sentencing judge of
    insight into his personality or how it is that he could have committed this
    terrible crime, and precipitating the Crowns withdrawal of its dangerous
    offender application.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was entitled to make this choice.  However, it does not follow that,
    by virtue of that fact, the sentencing judge was precluded from giving any
    weight to the appellants future dangerousness.  On the contrary, the
    sentencing judge was entitled  indeed obliged  to consider the full
    circumstances of these offences and this offender in determining whether the
    gravity of the appellants offences and his moral blameworthiness justified the
    maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  This included the available indicators
    of the appellants future dangerousness and the random and gratuitous nature of
    his attack on the complainant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the relevant authorities, including <em>R. v. L.M.</em>, 2008 SCC 31,
    [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163; <em>R. v. Cheddesingh</em>, 2004 SCC 16, [2004] 1 S.C.R.
    433; <em>R. v. Klair</em> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 336 (C.A.); <em>R. v. Horvath</em> (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 196 (Ont. C.A.); and <em>R. v. Knoblauch</em>, 2000 SCC
    58, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 780, and considering the governing sentencing principles
    and submissions of counsel, the sentencing judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In a case such as this, I must fashion a sentence that has as
    its paramount goals denunciation [s. 718(a)], general deterrence [s. 718(b)]
    and the need to separate the offender from society [s. 718(c)].</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>....</p>
  <p class=CQuote>After anxious consideration, and taking into account the
    circumstances of both the offence and the offender, I have concluded that ...
    the facts of this case are so bizarre and shocking that I can infer from the
    circumstances of the offence itself that [the appellant] poses an ongoing
    danger to the public.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Thus, I am of the firm view that the appropriate sentence for
    [the appellant] is imprisonment for life.  This result is required by the need
    to separate [the appellant] from society for the protection of the latter [s.
    718(c)] as well as the principle of proportionality set out in s. 718.1 of the <em>Code</em> both with respect to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility
    of the offender.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in the sentencing judges sentencing analysis.  As <em>R. v. L.M.</em> holds, at para. 21: [t]here is still place in criminal law for maximum
    sentences in appropriate circumstances.  In this case, the appellant was
    convicted of two offences, which each carry a maximum sentence of life
    imprisonment (aggravated sexual assault and attempt murder).  The circumstances
    of his crimes, described above, were especially egregious and aggravating.  The
    sentencing judge thoughtfully considered all the relevant sentencing principles,
    including the appellants dangerousness and the need to protect the public. 
    For the reasons expressed by him, a life sentence in this case is a fit
    sentence.</p>
