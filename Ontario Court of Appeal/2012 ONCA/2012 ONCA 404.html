  <p class=Judge>Hoy J.A.:</p>
  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>I.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary issue in these appeals is the scope of financing the
    supervising judge can or should approve, without the sanction of creditors,
    while a company is under the protection of the <em>Companies’ Creditors
    Arrangement Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as amended (the “CCAA”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Crystallex International Corporation (“Crystallex”) is a
    Canadian mining company. Its principal asset was the right to develop Las
    Cristinas in Venezuela, which is one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits
    in the world. Crystallex obtained this right through a contract with the
    Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (the “CVG”), a state-owned Venezuelan
    corporation. On February 3, 2011, after Crystallex spent over $500 million on
    developing Las Cristinas, the CVG sent Crystallex a letter to “unilaterally
    rescind” the contract for reasons of “expediency and convenience”. There is no
    suggestion in these proceedings that the rescission was due to any
    mismanagement by Crystallex.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of the cancellation of the contract, Crystallex was unable
    to pay its $100 million in senior 9.375 per cent notes due December 23, 2011
    (the “Notes”). It sought and, on December 23, 2011 obtained, protection under
    the CCAA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At present, Crystallex’s only asset of significance is an arbitration
    claim for US $3.4 billion against the government of Venezuela in relation to
    the cancellation of the contract. The arbitration claim is the “pot of gold” in
    the CCAA proceeding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Computershare Trust Company of Canada,<span
style='line-height:200%'> in its capacity as </span>Trustee for the holders of
    the Notes (the “Noteholders”), appeals, with leave, three orders made by the
    supervising judge in the CCAA proceeding: (i) the January 20, 2012 CCAA Bridge
    Financing Order (with reasons released January 25, 2012 and reported at 2012
    ONSC 538 (the “Bridge Financing Reasons”)) authorizing Crystallex to obtain
    bridge financing of $3.125 million (the “Bridge Loan”) from the respondent Tenor
    Special Situations Fund, L.P. (“Tenor L.P.”); (ii) the April 16, 2012 CCAA
    Financing Order authorizing Crystallex to obtain $36 million of what the
    supervising judge characterized as Debtor in Possession (“DIP”) financing from
    Tenor Special Situation Fund I, LLC (“Tenor”) (the “Tenor DIP Loan”); and (iii)
    the April 16, 2012 Management Incentive Plan Approval Order approving a
    Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) designed to ensure the retention of key
    executives until the arbitration is completed. The supervising judge’s reasons
    for the CCAA Financing Order and Management Incentive Plan Approval Order are
    reported at 2012 ONSC 2125 (the “DIP Financing Reasons”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among other conditions, the Tenor DIP Loan, due December 31, 2016,
    entitles Tenor to 35 per cent of the net proceeds of the arbitration in
    addition to interest, provides governance rights that may continue after
    Crystallex exits from CCAA protection, and requires Tenor’s approval to a range
    of options that might customarily be offered to unsecured creditors in seeking to
    negotiate a plan of compromise or arrangement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Substantially all of the creditors opposed the approval of the Bridge
    Loan, the Tenor DIP Loan and the MIP. Crystallex represents that it hopes to
    negotiate a plan of arrangement or compromise with the Noteholders and other
    creditors before the current stay until July 30, 2012 expires. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bulk of the $36 million Tenor DIP Loan comprises financing to pursue
    the arbitration claim, which may continue after the period of CCAA protection.</p>
  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>     <span
lang=X-NONE>THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CCAA was amended effective September 18, 2009 to add the following
    provisions regarding the grant of a charge to secure financing required by the
    debtor:  </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Interim financing</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>11.2 (1) On application by a debtor company and on
    notice to the secured creditors who are likely to be affected by the security
    or charge, a court may make an order declaring that all or part of the
    company’s property is subject to a security or charge – in an amount that the
    court considers appropriate – in favour of a person specified in the order who
    agrees to lend to the company an amount approved by the court as being required
    by the company, having regard to its cash-flow statement. The security or
    charge may not secure an obligation that exists before the order is made.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>...</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Factors to be considered</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(4) In deciding whether to make an order, the court
    is to consider, among other things,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) the period during which the company is
    expected to be subject to proceedings under this Act;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) how the company’s business and financial
    affairs are to be managed during the proceedings;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(c) whether the company’s management has the
    confidence of its major creditors;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(d) whether the loan would enhance the prospects
    of a viable compromise or arrangement being made in respect of the company;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(e) the nature and value of the company’s
    property;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(f) whether any creditor would be materially
    prejudiced as a result of the security or charge; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(g) the monitor’s report referred to in paragraph
    23(1)(b), if any.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Prior to the enactment of these provisions, the court
    relied on its general authority under the CCAA to approve DIP financing: see
    Lloyd W. Houlden, Geoffey B. Morawetz &amp; Janis P. Sarra, <em>The 2012
    Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em> (Toronto: Carswell, 2011), at p. 1175.</p>

  <h2><span lang=X-NONE>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>Events Prior to the CCAA Filings</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystallex
    has filed a Request for Arbitration pursuant to the Canada-Venezuela Bilateral
    Investment Treaty, claiming $3.4 billion plus interest for the loss of its
    investment in Las Cristinas. The hearing of the arbitration is scheduled for
    November 11, 2013. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystallex’s
    most significant liability is its debt to the Noteholders. In addition to
    amounts owed to the Noteholders, Crystallex has other liabilities of
    approximately CAD $1.2 million and approximately US $8 million. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    current Noteholders are hedge funds, some of whom purchased Notes after
    Venezuela announced its intention to expropriate Las Cristinas at prices as low
    as 25 cents on the dollar.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relationship between Crystallex and the current Noteholders is hostile. Crystallex
    and the Noteholders have been in litigation since 2008. Prior to the maturity
    date of the Notes, the Noteholders twice, unsuccessfully, brought court
    proceedings against Crystallex alleging that an event had occurred which
    accelerated Crystallex’s obligation to pay the Notes. Those proceedings were
    also heard by the supervising judge: see <em>Computershare Trust Co. of Canada
    v. Crystallex International Corp.</em> (2009), 65 B.L.R. (4th) 281 (S.C.),
    aff’d 2010 ONCA 364, 263 O.A.C. 137; and <em>Computershare v. Crystallex</em>, 2011
    ONSC 5748.</p>

    15</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 22, 2011, one day prior to the maturity of the Notes, Crystallex and
    the Noteholders filed competing CCAA applications. The Noteholders’ application
    contemplated that all existing common shares would be cancelled, an equity
    offering would be undertaken, and if, or to the extent, the equity proceeds
    were insufficient to pay out the Noteholders, the Notes would be converted to
    equity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystallex
    sought authority to file a plan of compromise and arrangement, the authority to
    continue to pursue the arbitration in Venezuela, and the authority to pursue
    all avenues of interim financing or a refinancing of its business and to
    conduct an auction to raise financing. In his supporting affidavit sworn
    December 22, 2011, Robert Fung, Crystallex’s Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer, indicated that Crystallex wished to have all claims stayed against it
    until the arbitration settled or Crystallex realized the arbitration award. Crystallex
    had already received an unsolicited offer of financing from Tenor Capital
    Management.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was (and is) expected that, if the arbitration is successful and the award is
    collected, there will be more than enough to pay the creditors and a
    significant amount will be available to shareholders. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 23, 2011, the supervising judge made an order granting Crystallex’s CCAA
    application (the “Initial Order”). In his reasons released December 28, 2011,
    he explained that the Noteholders’ proposal was not a fair balancing of the
    interests of all stakeholders: <em>Re Crystallex International Corporation</em>,
    2011 ONSC 7701, at para. 26. The Noteholders did not appeal the Initial Order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystallex
    obtained an order under chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code from

    with an orderly restructuring<em>.</em> It further provided:</p>

    auction to raise interim or DIP financing pursuant to procedures approved by

    hired an independent financial advisory firm, Skatoff &amp; Company, LLC, and
    developed a set of procedures to govern the solicitation of bids to provide financing
    to Crystallex. The Monitor, Ernst &amp; Young Inc., approved the bid
    procedures. The bid procedures indicated that Crystallex’s objective was to
    obtain financing of not less than $35 million, net of costs, that, on
    completion of the CCAA and U.S. Chapter 15 reorganization proceedings, would
    roll into financing maturing not sooner than December 31, 2014. The bid

    January 20, 2012, the supervising judge considered competing proposals from
    Tenor L.P. and the Noteholders to provide bridge financing. Tenor L.P. offered
    $3.125 million with interest at 10 per cent per annum. The Noteholders offered
    $3 million with interest at 1 per cent per annum.  </p>

    board of Crystallex, taking into account advice received from Mr. Skatoff,
    recommended the Tenor L.P. offer. Mr. Skatoff was concerned that the
    Noteholders’ objective may have been to defeat the larger DIP financing process
    so that they could ultimately impose financing terms on Crystallex. It was also

    January 20, 2012, the Noteholders brought a cross-motion to modify the DIP
    auction process then underway, which they severely criticized. They objected to
    the amount sought, the term, and the lender back-end entitlement a successful
    DIP lender could acquire. In their view, Crystallex was inappropriately seeking
    financing in excess of amounts required until a compromise or plan of
    arrangement could be arrived at between Crystallex and its creditors. Given
    their existing position in Crystallex, the Noteholders also objected to being
    required to sign a non-disclosure agreement containing a standstill provision

    is before the court for approval that these issues raised by the Noteholders
    would be more appropriately dealt with. Until then, there is no factual

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[23]&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tenor DIP

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(a)     Tenor will advance $36 million to
    Crystallex due and payable on December 31, 2016. This period for the loan is
    based on Crystallex’s arbitration counsel’s assessment of the likely timing of
    a decision from the arbitral tribunal and collection of the award. </span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(b)     The advances will be in four tranches,
    being $9 million upon execution of the loan documentation and approval of the
    facility by court order in Ontario, the second being $12 million upon any
    appeal of the Ontario court order approving the facility being dismissed and
    upon a U.S court order approving the facility, the third being $10 million when
    Crystallex has less than $2.5 million in cash and the fourth being $5 million
    when Crystallex again has less than $2.5 million in cash.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(c)     The loans are to be used to (i) repay
    an interim bridge loan of $3.25 million advanced by Tenor with court approval
    of January 20, 2012 and payable on April 16, 2012, (ii) fees and expenses in
    connection with the facility, (iii) general corporate expenses of Crystallex
    including expenses of the restructuring proceedings and of the arbitration in
    accordance with cash flow statements and budgets of Crystallex approved by
    Tenor from time to time.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(d)     Crystallex will pay Tenor a $1 million
    commitment fee.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(e)     $35 million of the loan amount will
    bear PIK interest (payment in kind, meaning it is capitalized and payable only
    upon maturity of the loan or upon receipt of the proceeds of the arbitration)
    at the rate of 10% per annum compounded semi-annually.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(f)&nbsp;     Tenor will receive additional
    compensation equal to 35% of the net proceeds of any arbitral award or
    settlement, conditional upon the second tranche of the loan being
    advanced.&nbsp; Net proceeds of the award or settlement is defined as the
    amount remaining after payment of principal and interest on the DIP loan, taxes
    and proven and allowed unsecured claims against Crystallex, including the noteholders,
    the latter of which will have a special charge for the unsecured amounts owing.
    Alternatively, Tenor can convert the right to additional compensation to 35% of
    the common shares of Crystallex.&nbsp; This conversion right is apparently
    driven by tax considerations.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[24]&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Tenor DIP
    facility also provides for the governance of Crystallex to be changed to give
    Tenor a substantial say in the governance of Crystallex. More particularly:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(a)      Crystallex shall have a reduced five
    person board of directors, being two current Crystallex directors, two nominees
    of Tenor and an independent director selected by agreement of Crystallex and
    Tenor.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(b)      The independent director shall be
    chair of the board of directors and shall not have a second-casting or tie-breaking
    vote.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(c)      The independent director shall be
    appointed a special managing director and shall have all the powers of the
    board of directors to (i) the conduct of the reorganization proceedings in
    Canada and in the U.S. and the efforts of Crystallex to reorganize the
    pre-filing claims of the unsecured creditors, (ii) any matters relating to the
    rights of Crystallex and Tenor as against the other under the facility, (iii)
    the administration of the MIP to the extent not otherwise delegated to the bonus
    pool committee under the MIP, and (iv) to retain any advisor in respect of
    these matters. The special manager shall first consult with a non-board
    advisory panel, consisting of the three Crystallex directors who will step down
    from the board, and consider in good faith their recommendations. </span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(d)      With respect to matters that may not
    at law be delegable to the special managing director, he will be required to
    obtain board approval. If the Tenor nominees use their votes to block that
    approval, Tenor will forfeit its 35% additional compensation.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[25]&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Tenor DIP
    facility contains proscribed rights of Tenor in the event of default. Tenor may
    seize and sell assets other than the arbitration proceeding (i.e. any cash and
    unsold mining equipment). It may not sell the arbitration claim. If there is a
    default before any arbitration award, Tenor would have the right to apply to
    court to have the Monitor or a Canadian receiver and manager appointed to take
    control of the arbitration proceedings. If such application were not granted,
    Tenor would be entitled to exercise the rights and remedies of a secured
    creditor pursuant to an order, the loan documentation or otherwise at law.</span></p>

    director, what an appropriate MIP would be. He in turn retained an independent
    national executive compensation consulting firm to provide expert advice. Mr.
    Swartz opined that the overall compensation proposal for the establishment of
    the bonus pool for the benefit of Crystallex’s management was reasonable in the

    proceeds of the arbitration up to $700 million and 2% of any further net
    proceeds, after all costs and charges, including the amounts owing to
    noteholders, is to be set aside and money in this pool may be paid to the
    beneficiaries of the MIP, depending on the determination of an independent
    committee. The amounts to be allocated to participants by the compensation
    committee are discretionary and could be nil. No one will be entitled to any
    particular amount. Members of the compensation committee will not be eligible
    for any payments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    MIP sets out a number of factors to be considered by the compensation committee
    in exercising its discretion. They include the amount and speed of recovery,
    the amount of time and energy expended by the individual, and the opportunity
    cost to the individual in staying with Crystallex. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span

    L.P.’s proposal be approved, he wrote, at para. 12: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>This was a business judgment protected by the business judgment

    process. The supervising judge observed, at para. 14:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Whether Mr. Skatoff is correct in his concerns, it seems to me
    that the relatively minor extra cost involving the Tenor proposed bridge

    Crystallex in approving the Tenor DIP Loan is a factor that can be taken into

    compromise. Notably, it did not take away the rights of the Noteholders as
    unsecured creditors to apply for a bankruptcy order or to vote on a plan of
    compromise or arrangement. A vote of the creditors was therefore not required (at
    para. 50). In coming to this conclusion, the supervising judge relied on <em>Re
    Calpine Canada Energy Limited</em>,<em> </em>2007 ABQB 504, 415 A.R. 196, leave
    to appeal refused, 2007 ABCA 266, 417 A.R. 25.</p>

    with the Noteholders during the stay extension until July 30, 2012 (paras. 48,
    126). The Tenor DIP Loan is therefore distinguishable from the financing
    rejected by the court in <em>Cliffs Over Maple Bay Investments Ltd. v. Fisgard Capital
    Corp.</em>, 2008 BCCA 327, 296 D.L.R. (4th) 577, because in that case the

    part of the assets of Crystallex, it is appropriate to consider the <em>Soundair</em> factors in deciding whether to approve it (at para. 59). Crystallex conducted a
    robust competitive bidding process (at para. 39). </p>

    facility “would seriously erode the chances of Crystallex obtaining third party
    financing in October” (at para. 90). Counsel for Computershare had said during
    argument on the motion that the Noteholders “were not prepared to agree to such
    a $35 million facility at this time but only at some future time as the $10
    million facility they now proposed became due” (at para. 27). While it would
    have been preferable if the Noteholders had been willing to lend on the basis
    of the terms of the Tenor DIP facility, “it was made clear during argument that

  <p class=DSubquote style='
line-height:200%'>(a)     Given that Crystallex intends, if
    possible, to negotiate an acceptable plan of arrangement or compromise, the
    length of time during which Crystallex is expected to be subject to the CCAA
    proceedings is not a determinative factor. The financing will be required to
    pursue the arbitration (at para. 62) and, as the supervising judge noted, “the
    only way any of the creditors will receive any substantial cash payment is from
    the proceeds of the arbitration” (at para. 47);</p>
  <p class=DSubquote style='
line-height:200%'>(b)  The management of the business and
    affairs of Crystallex “are a reasonable compromise between Crystallex and Tenor
    designed to protect the interests of the stakeholders, including the
    noteholders” (at para. 73). The fact that Tenor is given substantial governance
    rights does not in itself mean that the DIP Tenor Loan should not be approved.
    Tenor does not have the right to conduct the reorganization proceedings or the
    arbitration proceeding. Moreover, under s. 11.5(1) of the CCAA, the court may
    remove a director whom it is satisfied is unreasonably impairing or is likely
    to unreasonably impair the possibility of a viable compromise or arrangement
    being made. Arguably, a court could remove a Tenor nominee under this section
    without triggering an event of default under the Tenor DIP Loan (at paras.
    63-71);</p>
  <p class=DSubquote style='
line-height:200%'>(c)     While the Noteholders expressed
    “extreme displeasure” at Crystallex’s management’s delay in commencing
    arbitration proceedings, they do not oppose management having a continuing role
    in the arbitration (at para. 72);</p>
  <p class=DSubquote style='
line-height:200%'>(d)     The Noteholders’ argument that the
    terms of the Tenor DIP Loan – in particular, the fact that the refusal of the
    court to grant a stay or a bankruptcy are events of default, the grant of a 35
    per cent interest in the arbitration proceeds, and the limits on the type of
    restructuring that can be concluded without the approval of Tenor – will
    effectively prevent any plan of arrangement was rejected (at paras. 74-82). While,
    as the Monitor points out, the introduction of a third party, Tenor, with
    consent rights to certain actions will add complexity to the negotiation of a
    CCAA plan (at para. 93), the Tenor DIP Loan would enhance the prospects of a
    viable compromise or arrangement (at para. 83):  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>... Crystallex requires additional financing to pay its
    expenses and continue the arbitration. A DIP loan allows the company to have
    the arbitration financed, which if it were not at this stage would impair the
    arbitration and perhaps the attitude of  Venezuela towards the arbitration
    claim, and as such enhances the viability of a CCAA plan. I have not accepted
    the argument of the noteholders that the loan would prevent a plan of
    arrangement.</p>

    of the supervising judge to select an “end point” beyond the expected
    conclusion of a plan. It argues that the duration of the Tenor DIP Loan is
    tailored to Crystallex’s unique circumstance: all stakeholders acknowledge that
    the arbitration must be pursued in order for there to be meaningful recovery. In
    any event, it argues, marginal notes, such as the heading “interim financing”
    in s. 11.2, are not part of the statute, and their value is limited when a

    agree with the Noteholders that s. 11.2 contemplates the grant of a charge, the
    primary purpose of which is to secure financing required by the debtor while it
    is expected to be subject to proceedings under the CCAA. A further purpose,
    however, is to enhance the prospects of a plan of compromise or arrangement
    that will lead to a continuation of the company, albeit in restructured form,
    after plan approval. </p>

    11.2(4)(a) directs the court to consider the period during which the debtor is
    expected to be subject to proceedings under the CCAA. It stops short of
    confining the financing to the period that the debtor is subject to the CCAA. Section
    11.2(4)(d) directs the court to consider if the financing would enhance the
    prospects of a viable compromise or arrangement.</p>

    regard to the broad remedial purpose of the CCAA and the broad residual
    authority of a supervising judge described in <em>Century Services</em>, in my
    view section 11.2 does not restrict the ability of the supervising judge, where
    appropriate, to approve the grant of a charge securing financing before a plan
    is approved that may continue after the company emerges from CCAA protection.
    Indeed, although in very different circumstances, financing to be available on
    the debtor’s emergence from CCAA protection (sometimes called “exit financing”)
    was approved before a plan was approved in <em>Air Canada</em>.<a href="#_ftn4"

    that it would be unusual for a court to approve exit financing where opposed by
    substantially all of the creditors. Exit or post-plan financing is often a key
    element, or a pre-requisite, of the plan voted on by creditors.</p>

    significantly, in this case, the supervising judge found there could be no meaningful
    recovery, and therefore no successful restructuring, without the financing of
    the arbitration. Although the Noteholders characterized the Tenor DIP Loan as
    “exit financing”, it furthered the remedial purpose of the CCAA. To that
    extent, it is appropriate in the first sense used by Deschamps J. in <em>Century
    Services</em>, even though it may well outlast the period of CCAA protection. The
    supervising judge’s focus on the fact that the Tenor DIP Loan provided
    financing for the arbitration was not, in the circumstances, an error of
    principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Noteholders’ real argument is that the <em>means</em> by which the
    Tenor DIP Loan was approved were not appropriate. Ideally, a CCAA supervising
    judge is able to assist creditors and debtors in coming to a compromise. The
    creditors and Crystallex have not “achieved common ground” on a very
    significant matter. Effectively, the Noteholders argue that the creditors have
    not been treated as advantageously and fairly as the circumstances permit. They
    are the senior creditors and their offer to provide DIP financing on terms they
    argue matched those of the Tenor DIP Loan was not accepted. With sufficient
    financing in place to fund the arbitration, their leverage in negotiating a
    share of the arbitration proceeds has been reduced. Moreover, the Noteholders
    argue, the supervising judge erred in applying the business judgment rule, and,
    contrary to <em>Cliffs Over Maple Bay</em>, involuntarily stayed their rights
    during what they characterize as a restructuring. I consider each of these
    arguments below.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Noteholders point to their affidavit on the April motion indicating they would
    submit to an order to advance funds on the same terms as the Tenor DIP Loan “in
    the event that prior to October 1, 2012, the Court orders that such long-term
    financing is appropriate and necessary”. The supervising judge wrote that it
    would have been a preferable outcome if the Noteholders had been prepared to
    lend at the time of the April motion on the terms of the Tenor DIP facility:
    DIP Financing Reasons, at para. 91. The Noteholders argue that: they were
    prepared to advance funds on the terms of the Tenor DIP Loan, if so ordered;
    the supervising judge misapprehended the evidence; and, given the supervising
    judge’s comment that it would have been preferable if the Noteholders had been
    prepared to lend, that misapprehension affected the outcome of the motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    supervising judge’s comment at para. 91 of the DIP Financing Reasons makes his
    real concern clear. There, he stated that “at this time” the Noteholders were
    not prepared to lend on the terms of the Tenor DIP Loan. The Noteholders’ view
    as of April 5, 2012 was that such long-term financing was <span
class=Underline>not</span> necessary, as the $10 million they offered to
    advance at that time met Crystallex’s then cash requirements. The Noteholders
    reserved their rights to continue to oppose the approval of long term financing
    before they had come to an agreement with Crystallex about their entitlement,
    as creditors. Further hearings, and further arguments, were required. The
    supervising judge found, at para. 83 of the DIP Financing Reasons, that not
    putting sufficient financing in place to finance the arbitration “at this
    stage” would impair the arbitration. There was no suggestion from counsel for
    the Noteholders that on April 5, 2012 the Noteholders were prepared to waive
    the condition permitting them to continue to oppose the approval of long term
    financing. I am not satisfied that the supervising judge clearly misapprehended
    the evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Crystallex’s view, a reduction of the Noteholders’ leverage was desirable. It
    points to the Noteholders’ competing CCAA application, seeking to cancel all of
    the shareholders’ equity, which the supervising judge rejected as not fairly
    balancing the interests of all stakeholders. The Noteholders’ plan,
    subsequently proposed, would entitle them to 46 per cent of the equity in
    return for giving up their Notes, which Crystallex also views as excessive.<a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystallex
    argues that the Noteholders are not contractually entitled to convert their
    Notes to equity, and should therefore not be entitled to do so. Moreover, they
    argue, in the event of bankruptcy, the Noteholders would only be entitled to
    recover their principal and interest at the statutory rate of 5 per cent under
    the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, and, if the
    arbitration is realized, they will be entitled to the higher rate of interest
    they are contractually entitled to under the Notes. As Deschamps J. noted at
    para. 77 of <em>Century Services</em>, participants in a reorganization
    “measure the impact of a reorganization against the position they would enjoy
    in liquidation”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Noteholders counter that, contractually, they were entitled to be repaid on
    December 23, 2011 and, since they were not, and Crystallex proposes to defer
    repayment for several years and repay the Notes only if the arbitration is
    successful, the long delay entitles them to some equity participation. Moreover,
    contractually, Crystallex is restricted from incurring the Tenor DIP Loan,
    which will be senior to the Notes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crystallex
    points to the terms of the Initial Order, affording the “best offer” the
    protection of the <em>Soundair</em> principles, and providing that “topping
    offers” would not be considered by the court. Crystallex points out that the
    Noteholders did not appeal the Initial Order and argues that accepting the
    Noteholders’ matching offer would offend the <em>Soundair</em> principles. In
    Crystallex’s view, the Noteholders were treated fairly. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    turn, the Noteholders argue that the Initial Order authorized Crystallex to
    conduct an auction to raise <em>interim or DIP financing</em> pursuant to
    procedures approved by the Monitor. Since the outset, the Noteholders maintained
    their objection that the auction process sought more than interim or true DIP
    financing. The supervising judge deferred consideration of their objections
    until the DIP facility was before the court for approval.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    Noteholders are sophisticated parties. They pursued a strategy. It ultimately
    proved less successful than hoped. It appears that the supervising judge would
    have been prepared to approve the advance of funds to Crystallex by the
    Noteholders, on the terms of the Tenor DIP Loan, notwithstanding the <em>Soundair</em> principles, had the Noteholders agreed to do so, without condition, on April 5,
    2012. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts of this case are unusual: there is a single “pot of gold” asset which, if
    realized, will provide significantly more than required to repay the creditors.
    The supervising judge was in the best position to balance the interests of all stakeholders.
    I am of the view that the supervising judge’s exercise of discretion in
    approving the Tenor DIP Loan was reasonable and appropriate, despite having the
    effect of constraining the negotiating position of the creditors. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    supervising judge held that in addition to the factors in s. 11.2(4) of the
    CCAA, he could take into account the exercise or lack thereof of business
    judgment by the board of directors of a debtor corporation in considering DIP
    financing: DIP Financing Reasons, at paras. 32-35. He cited <em>Stelco Inc.
    (Re)</em> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 5 (C.A.), as authority for this proposition.<a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that a debtor’s board of directors recommends interim financing is not a determinative
    factor, and in some cases may not be a material factor, in considering whether
    to make an order under s. 11.2. It would be unusual if the board did not
    recommend the financing for which the debtor seeks approval. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Stelco</em> should not be read as authority for the principle that the recommendation of
    the directors of a debtor under CCAA protection is entitled to deference in
    evaluating whether financing should be approved under s. 11.2 of the CCAA where
    the factors outlined in s. 11.2(4) have not been complied with. In <em>Stelco,</em> the debtor did not seek court approval of a recommendation of the board. In the
    case of interim financing, the court must make an independent determination, and
    arrive at an appropriate order, having regard to the factors in s. 11.2(4). It
    may consider, but not defer to, and is not fettered by, the recommendation of
    the board.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    weight given by the supervising judge to the business judgment of the board of
    directors of Crystallex in recommending the Tenor DIP Loan is not, however, a
    basis for this court to interfere with his decision: <em>New Skeena Forest
    Products</em>,<em> </em>at<em> </em>para. 26. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Cliffs Over Maple Bay</span></em>, the
    debtor was the developer of a 300 acre site intended to include residential
    units, a golf course and a hotel. The debtor obtained protection under the CCAA
    and sought approval of financing that would permit it to complete material
    parts of the development. It believed that the proceeds generated from the sale
    of units thus completed would be sufficient to fund the remaining portions of the
    development and that, if the development were completed, there would be
    sufficient sale proceeds to satisfy all of the debtor’s obligations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge approved the financing; the mortgagees of the development
    appealed. The British Columbia Court of Appeal noted, at para. 35, that it was
    not suggested that the debtor intended to propose an arrangement or compromise
    to its creditors before embarking on its restructuring plan. The court allowed
    the appeal, writing:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[37] … DIP financing should not be authorized to permit the
    debtor company to pursue a restructuring plan that does not involve an
    arrangement or compromise with its creditors ...</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[38] ... What the Debtor Company was endeavouring to accomplish
    in this case was to freeze the rights of all of its creditors while it
    undertook its restructuring plan without giving the creditors an opportunity to
    vote on the plan. The CCAA was not intended, in my view, to accommodate a
    non-consensual stay of creditors’ rights while a debtor company attempts to carry
    out a restructuring plan that does not involve an arrangement or compromise
    upon which the creditors may vote.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the supervising judge that this case can be distinguished from <em>Cliffs
    Over Maple Bay</em>, which turned on the court’s finding that the debtor did
    not intend to negotiate a plan with its creditors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Mr. Fung initially indicated that Crystallex’s plan was to stay creditors’
    claims until the arbitration was settled or realized, his more recent evidence
    was that approval of the Tenor DIP Loan does not preclude further discussions
    about a plan with the creditors. In submissions before the supervising judge,
    and again before this court, counsel for Crystallex reiterated that Crystallex
    intended to exit from CCAA protection as soon as a plan was negotiated with the
    creditors and approved, and that Crystallex intended to negotiate a plan by the
    expiry of the stay on July 30, 2012. The supervising judge found that
    Crystallex intended to negotiate a plan with its creditors. There is some basis
    in the record for such a conclusion.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span

    arrangement or compromise cannot be imposed on creditors unless it has been
    approved by a majority in number representing two thirds in value of the
    creditors: see s. 6(1) of the CCAA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    supervising judge rejected the argument that the Tenor DIP Loan was a plan of
    arrangement or compromise and therefore required the approval of the creditors.
    He held, at para. 50 of the DIP Financing Reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A &quot;plan of arrangement&quot; or a &quot;compromise&quot;
    is not defined in the CCAA. It is, however, to be an arrangement or compromise
    between a debtor and its creditors. The Tenor DIP facility is not on its face
    such an arrangement or compromise between Crystallex and its creditors.
    Importantly the rights of the noteholders are not taken away from them by the
    Tenor DIP facility. The noteholders are unsecured creditors. Their rights are
    to sue to judgment and enforce the judgment. If not paid, they have a right to
    apply for a bankruptcy order under the BIA. Under the CCAA, they have the right
    to vote on a plan of arrangement or compromise. None of these rights are taken
    away by the Tenor DIP.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree. While the approval of the Tenor DIP Loan affected the Noteholders’
    leverage in negotiating a plan, and has made the negotiation of a plan more
    complex, it did not compromise the terms of their indebtedness or take away any
    of their legal rights. It is accordingly not an arrangement, and a creditor
    vote was not required. In this case it was within the discretion of the
    supervising judge to approve the Tenor DIP Loan.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the supervising judge noted, employee retention provisions are frequently
    authorized before a plan is negotiated. The supervising judge was alive to the
    exceptionally large amounts that might be paid to beneficiaries of the MIP
    (including Mr. Fung) in this case. The supervising judge took specific note of
    the issues that the Noteholders had raised in the past regarding the extent to
    which the independent committee of the board that recommended the MIP was truly
    independent, and the steps taken by that committee to address those concerns.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    recommendation of an independent committee of the board that has obtained
    expert advice is entitled to more weight in the consideration of a MIP than is
    the recommendation of the board in the consideration of whether financing
    should be approved under s. 11.2 of the CCAA. The CCAA does not list specific
    factors to be considered by the court in the case of a MIP. Moreover, the board
    would have the best sense of which employees were essential to the success of
    its restructuring efforts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to considering the recommendation of the independent committee of the
    board and Mr. Swartz, the supervising judge also reviewed the evidence to
    consider whether any persons had been included in the MIP who should not have
    been. He did not rely solely on the board’s recommendation.</p>
