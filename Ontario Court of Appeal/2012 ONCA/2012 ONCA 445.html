  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the third of a trilogy of class action cases against
    federally-regulated employers claiming unpaid overtime pay: see also <em>Fulawka
    v. Bank of Nova Scotia</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2012 ONCA 443,</span></em> and <em>Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</em>, 2012 ONCA 444. The
    courts concurrently released reasons in <em>Fulawka</em> and <em>Fresco</em> explain why the two class actions against the defendant banks for unpaid
    overtime pay should be certified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The present class action against the defendant, Canadian National
    Railway Company (defendant or CN), is premised on a different theory of
    liability than in the overtime class actions against the banks. The overtime
    actions against the banks are brought on behalf of class members who were
    classified as non-managerial employees.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> Their right to be paid overtime wages at 1.5 times their normal hourly rate is
    provided for in their employment contracts and by the provisions of Part III of
    the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 (<i>Code</i>). The
    central issue is not whether the class members are eligible for overtime pay
    but, rather, whether the policies, practices or systems of the defendant banks
    have effectively and routinely denied payment of overtime compensation to class
    members, contrary to the express or implied terms of their employment
    contracts.      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, in the present case, CN has classified the class members as
    managerial employees. The class consists of First Line Supervisors (FLSs)
    employed by CN. The effect of s.167(2)(a) of the <em>Code</em> is that
    employers are not required to pay overtime compensation as provided in Part III
    of the <em>Code</em> to employees who are managers or superintendents or
    exercise management functions. CNs overtime policy explicitly excludes FLSs
    from eligibility for overtime pay. The success of the proposed class action for
    unpaid overtime pay thus depends on the threshold issue whether CN has
    misclassified FLSs as managerial employees. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion to certify the class action against CN under s. 5(1) of the <em>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c. C.6, s. 30 (<em>CPA</em>), was
    heard together with CNs motion under Rule 21 of the <em>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, to dismiss the action. On the Rule 21
    motion, CN argued that the Superior Court of Justice lacks jurisdiction to hear
    the proposed action. The motion judge rejected this argument. However, he
    struck, dismissed and stayed various elements of the plaintiffs claims in
    negligence and breach of contract. The motion judge granted the motion for
    certification, but in doing so, he significantly re-drafted the common issues. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties have appealed different elements of the motion judges
    orders. The plaintiff appeals from the Rule 21 order and the certification
    order, while CN appeals and cross-appeals from the Rule 21 order and appeals
    from the certification order. CN also appeals from the order awarding the
    plaintiff his costs of both motions. All the appeals that would otherwise lie
    in the Divisional Court have been traversed to this court.<a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties raise a matrix of issues before this court. However, it is
    not necessary to decide most of these issues to dispose of the various appeals
    and cross-appeals. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow CNs appeal from the
    certification order and set aside that order. I conclude that the motion judge
    was correct in rejecting the plaintiffs proposed common issues concerning
    whether CN misclassified FLSs as managerial employees. The evidence on the
    motion did not support a finding that a common issues trial judge would be able
    to resolve the fundamental issue of misclassification on a class-wide basis.
    Rather, the evidence indicated that individualized assessments of the job
    duties and responsibilities of class members would be needed to determine if
    they were properly classified. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the motion judge fell into reversible error in recasting as a
    common issue the question of what the minimum requirements are to be a
    managerial employee at CN. The same evidentiary deficiency  the lack of
    evidence supporting a finding of a core of commonality concerning FLSs job
    duties and responsibilities  still remained.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These conclusions on the absence of a core of commonality make it
    unnecessary to decide the correctness of the motion judges rulings on the Rule
    21 motion, or to review his rulings on the other proposed common issues and
    preferable procedure. At the end of these reasons, I comment briefly on a few
    practice points that arise out of some of these rulings. </p>

    of the Proposed Class Proceeding</a></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    putative representative plaintiff, Michael McCracken (plaintiff), is a former
    CN employee. He started this action on behalf of approximately 1,550 current
    and former non-unionized CN employees across Canada who have held the position
    of FLS since July 5, 2002. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff began working at CN in 1998 as a unionized employee. In October 2005,
    he was promoted to the non-unionized position of manager of corridor operations,
    which is a FLS position. In January 2008, he was promoted to the position of senior
    manager, corridor operations. The plaintiff alleges in his statement of claim<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></span></a> that the senior manager position is a FLS position, while according to CN, it is
    a higher-ranking managerial position rather than a FLS position. The plaintiff
    held the position of senior manager, corridor operations until March 26, 2008,
    the day after he served the statement of claim in this action. He deposed that
    he was informed that he was being demoted to the unionized position of dispatcher
    because he had started the action and not for performance deficiencies. The
    plaintiff resigned from CN in 2010. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff pleads causes of action against CN based on CNs alleged violation of
    the <em>Code</em>, breach of contract, breach of a duty of good faith,
    negligence and unjust enrichment. The central allegation driving the proposed
    class action is that, since July 5, 2002, CN has uniformly, deliberately,
    improperly, negligently, and illegally misclassified FLSs as managers. As a
    result of this misclassification, CN is said to have unlawfully deprived the
    class members of their entitlement to receive overtime pay and holiday wages as
    stipulated by the <em>Code</em>. The statement of claim alleges that all class
    members have been regularly scheduled, as a matter of uniform company policy,
    to work in excess of 40 hours per work week or 8 hours per day without
    receiving overtime pay, contrary to law and in violation of various provisions
    of Part III of the <em>Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, as will
    be discussed below</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    plaintiff claims $250 million in general damages, $50 million in special
    damages and an order pursuant to s. 24 of the <em>CPA</em> directing an
    aggregate assessment of damages. The plaintiff also seeks an order requiring CN
    to disgorge amounts wrongly withheld from the class in respect of unpaid
    overtime and holiday pay. In addition, the plaintiff requests various forms of
    declaratory and injunctive relief, including a declaration that CN has been
    unjustly enriched, and a declaration that CN has breached the <em>Code</em> and
    the express or implied terms of the employment contracts with class members by
    misclassifying these employees and by failing to pay them overtime pay.</p>

    of FLSs at CN</a></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    CNs employment hierarchy, FLSs are immediately above unionized workers and
    immediately below the non-unionized managerial positions of assistant superintendant
    and superintendant. FLSs are the primary point of contact between the
    non-unionized and unionized workforce. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approximately
    82 percent of CNs Canadian employees are unionized. This element of CNs
    workforce is represented by five major unions and is divided into over 30
    different bargaining units, each of which is governed by a different collective
    agreement. The collective agreements regulate such matters as the length of the
    work week, overtime, vacation pay, and contracting out of work. FLSs are
    required to know and enforce the rules found in the various collective
    agreements that apply to the unionized employees under their supervision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CNs
    recruiting materials describe the duties of FLSs as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The First Line Supervisor manages the day-to-day operation of
    their territory through their unionized staff; ensures the on-time performance
    of trains, delivering on our commitments to our customers; the efficient
    utilization of locomotives and repair of cars (Mechanical); repair and
    maintenance of trackage and signals (Engineering); and safe haulage of
    merchandise to their destination (Transportation); as well as interacting with
    customers (Marketing). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN
    identified 70 different job positions held by FLSs. More than 90 percent of
    FLSs are responsible for duties associated with train operations, which
    encompasses the movement of trains, the repair and maintenance of tracks and
    signals, and the repair and maintenance of train cars and engines. There are
    also FLS positions in finance and accounting, customer service, corporate
    facilities, and various other miscellaneous positions.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    salary range for FLSs is from $55,600 to $109,200. FLSs are eligible for
    bonuses equivalent to 15 to 30 percent of their base pay. They are also entitled
    to benefits, including a defined benefit pension plan and a share purchase
    plan. </p>

    Overtime Policy</a> </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CNs
    overtime policy, titled Compensation Management  Time Management (Policy),
    came into effect on January 1, 2006. The Policy put into writing the policy and
    practice that had existed at CN since July 5, 2002. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Policy states that it is intended for non-unionized, professional and
    administrative support employees working in Canada. <em>For greater clarity,
    this policy does not apply to managers, supervisors or anyone who exercise[s]
    management functions</em> (emphasis added). The Policy entitles non-unionized
    and non-managerial employees of CN to receive compensation at a rate of 1.5
    times the employees regular rate for pre-authorized or directed overtime hours
    worked. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>FLSs
    are not eligible for such overtime pay under the Policy.  However, the Policy
    provides that FLSs may be paid discretionary lump sum amounts in extraordinary
    circumstances where extensive hours are required:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the spirit of the FLS compensation package, First Line
    Supervisors may receive payments under the Service Response/Emergency program,
    in case of extraordinary circumstances where extensive hours are required e.g.
    derailments, severe winter conditions etc. Under these special circumstances, a
    Vice-President, General Manager or equivalent may authorize a special lump sum
    payment to be paid in increments of $500. In cases involving payments in excess
    of $2,500, the authorizing officer will review the circumstances with the appropriate
    Vice-President. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Policy also provides that FLSs who are required to work on a general holiday
    will receive time off at the regular rate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff refers to the Policy several times in his statement of claim. He
    asserts that the Policy forms part of each class members contract of
    employment. He alleges that FLSs had been entitled to receive overtime wages
    until July 5, 2002, when the Policy came into effect. The plaintiff requests a
    declaration that the Policy is unlawful, void and unenforceable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the certification motion, CN led evidence that conflicted with the plaintiffs
    allegation that FLSs received overtime wages up until July 5, 2002. CN pointed
    to its 1998 policy on overtime applicable to FLSs working in the Operations
    Division,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    pleads that FLSs are frequently called for unscheduled work and to substitute
    for unionized and non-unionized employees: see the motion judges reasons, at

    motion judge granted CNs Rule 21 motion in part and granted the plaintiffs

  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The language of the <em>Code</em> reveals that Parliament
    intended that courts have a subject matter jurisdiction to enforce wage claims
    for overtime and thus the statutory rights in the <em>Code</em><i> </i>are
    terms of the contract of FLSs by force of statute: see paras. 114-85.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span

  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the plaintiffs claim for breach of contract based on
    CNs alleged failure to pay holiday pay should be dismissed on the merits

    described a festering point of complaint by defendants that a plaintiff need

    to provide any evidence concerning FLSs in 56 of the 70 job positions held by

    Revised List was predicated on his submission that, at the common issues trial,
    the court could and should determine whether FLSs were properly or improperly
    classified as managers on a class-wide basis: see the motion judges reasons,
    at para. 323.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    motion judge prepared an amended list containing six common issues (the Amended
    Revised List) and requested the parties submissions on his suggestions:  see the
    motion judges reasons, at para. 325, and Appendix B to these reasons. This
    list did not include misclassification of the class as a free-standing common
    issue, although it included questions about whether CN had statutory or common
    law duties to properly classify class members and, if so, whether CN had
    breached any of these alleged duties.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff accepted the Amended Revised List with the following three
    reservations: i) misclassification of the whole class should be certified as a
    common issue, as the plaintiff had initially submitted; ii) there should be an
    additional common issue about how management status can be determined on a
    class-wide basis; and iii) there should be a common issue about the aggregate
    assessment of damages. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN
    disputed that any of the proposed common issues  whether from the plaintiffs Revised
    List or the motion judges Amended Revised List  are proper common issues for
    one or more or all of the following reasons: (i) the issues are not common to
    the class; (ii) answering the proposed common issues depends on individual
    findings of fact for each claimant; (iii) the proposed common issues are not
    necessary to the resolution of each class members claim for overtime; (iv)

    motion judge observed, at paras. 353-54, that four of these questions (common
    issues 1, 2, 4 and 5) are answerable before the common issues trial. He said,
    at para. 359, that while answering these four questions would advance the
    litigation, they are not determinative of the action because the heart of the
    matter remains whether the first line supervisors were or were not managers,
    which is unanswered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arriving at this list, the motion judge rejected the plaintiffs proposed
    common issues 1, 2, 3(a)-(b), 4(a)-(i) and 7(a) from the Revised List. He
    observed, at para. 331, that these questions, which include the proposed misclassification
    common issue: lack commonality or would depend on individual findings of fact
    for each claimant. In his opinion, these questions cannot be determined on a
    class-wide basis and rather require individual questions to be answered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather
    than certifying misclassification as a common issue, the motion judge certified
    a common issue of his own design  common issue 3  which would identify the
    minimum requirements to be a managerial employee at CN.<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    problems of commonality of the plaintiffs proposed misclassification
    question. He found, at paras. 363-64, that common issue 3 could be answered on
    a class-wide basis and that doing so would substantially advance the litigation
    because it would divide the class into the following three groups:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i) class members who satisfy the minimum standards for being a
    manager at CN because of who they are and what they do; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii) class members who could not possibly satisfy the minimum standards

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the motion judge, at para. 367, by dividing the class into these three
    groups, the claims of the first group would be dismissed, while the claims of
    the latter two groups would proceed to manageable individual issues trials as
    contemplated by s. 25 of the <em>CPA</em>.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found Mr. McCracken to be a suitable representative plaintiff

    in the class is adverse in interest to other class members and he was astute
    enough to hire seasoned class action counsel to prosecute the litigation: see

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the litigation plan, the motion judge observed, at para. 474, that the

    based on the outcomes of the motion and cross-motion. He held that, even in
    the absence of a suitable litigation plan, this criterion was satisfied because

    even though the defendant succeeded in part on the Rule 21 motion and even

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed, the class members claims for damages for unpaid overtime are framed
    in breach of statute, breach of contract, negligence and unjust enrichment. In
    attempting to make this action amenable to certification as a class proceeding,
    the plaintiff proposed a common issue concerning misclassification. In theory,
    if this common issue were to be resolved in the plaintiffs favour, this would
    be a finding that CN had uniformly and improperly classified all FLSs as
    managerial employees. Such a finding would significantly advance the unpaid
    overtime claims of class members on a class-wide basis because it would
    establish their eligibility to receive overtime wages under Part III of the <em>Code</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conversely,
    if CN were found to have properly classified the class members as managers or
    as employees who exercise managerial functions, then CN would not have breached
    any alleged statutory or private law duty to pay them overtime wages and their
    claims would fail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central factual assertion related to the misclassification issue is found in
    paragraph 13 of the statement of claim:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The nature of the Class Members duties, responsibilities and
    authority is such that they were not managers or superintendents or exercising
    management functions within the meaning of section 167(2) of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no question that, in the abstract, a class-wide resolution of the issue
    concerning the alleged misclassification of FLSs would significantly advance the
    litigation. A crucial question on the motion was whether there is some basis in
    fact to find that the misclassification issue could be resolved commonly.  </p>

    plaintiffs Revised List includes other questions concerning the

    or tort duties to properly classify the class members and, if so, whether CN
    breached any of these duties: see common issues 2, 3(a) and (b) and 4(a)-(i) in
    Appendix A. My analysis of common issue 1 applies equally to the
    misclassification issue as it arises out of these common issues. </p>

    not subject to overtime.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. To your knowledge has there ever been an analysis of each of
    the jobs of the first line supervisors to determine whether theyre managers?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. No. We rely largely on when someone is appointed a first
    line supervisor, say a trainmaster, clearly this individual is administered
    along the job grade and compensated accordingly.</p>

    from the plaintiff, 11 current or former class members, and two CN employees
    who are union representatives. The class members who gave affidavit evidence on

  <p class=CQuote>I do not believe that I was ever a manager or that I ever
    exercised management functions while I was a FLS. I could not hire, fire,

    limited to investigating and recommending that minor disciplinary warnings be
    issued. I lacked the power to decide whether discipline would actually be
    imposed and, if so, its nature. Those decisions were made by my supervisors and
    more senior managers. I could not make budgetary or expenditure decisions on
    behalf of CN. I was told by my manager that I lacked the authority to make any
    changes to schedules for rail traffic controllers, even if I felt that a change

    Misclassification Issue</a></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CNs
    primary position on commonality, as described by the motion judge, at para. 56,
    was that the misclassification issue, as a matter of adjudication, cannot be
    proved globally in a class action because the status of each FLS must be
    assessed individually. To support this position, CN lead evidence to show a
    wide disparity in the roles and functions of FLSs, including of FLSs holding
    the same job position: see the motion judges reasons, at para. 69. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN
    tendered evidence  including affidavits from 19 class members  to show that
    class members work in different environments ranging from small towns to large
    cities, from office environments to shops, garages, small depots, or outdoors
    in train yards, or along the vast length of track that comprises CNs rail
    network: see the motion judges reasons, at para. 44. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, in an effort to highlight the lack of commonality of FLSs job
    functions and responsibilities, CN introduced a chart outlining the affidavit
    evidence adduced by both parties about the varying duties and responsibilities
    of class members who held the positions of MCO and trainmaster. CN argued that
    this chart illustrates that the level of authority and managerial
    responsibility of class members varies significantly. For example, some MCOs
    deposed that they have authority to approve overtime and to perform job
    performance appraisals of unionized employees without approval or oversight
    from higher levels of CN management. In contrast, other MCOs deposed that they
    have no authority to make any changes to work schedules or to provide input
    into performance evaluations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    some class members who held the position of trainmaster said that they have
    authority to directly lay off unionized employees or to make decisions about
    required staffing levels that sometimes cause lay-offs, while another class
    member asserted that trainmasters cannot unilaterally lay-off employees.
    Several trainmasters gave evidence that they have the authority to remove an
    employee from service where drugs or alcohol are involved and in the event of a
    serious rule violation. There was no evidence to the contrary. Several trainmasters
    indicated that they have authority to impose demerit points and to level
    discipline, while others said that they never disciplined employees or they
    claimed to have only a limited role in discipline.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, CNs tendered affidavit evidence indicated that FLSs working in more
    remote locations exercise greater decision-making authority than FLSs working
    in busier, more urban locations where more senior-level managers are present in
    the workplace. For example, one trainmaster, Norman Hart, deposed that he
    supervised only 16 yard employees and inbound and outbound train crews when he
    worked at CNs largest rail yard near downtown Toronto, whereas he supervised
    well over 100 employees when he worked at a smaller yard in Hornepayne,
    Ontario. His evidence indicated that he exercised more significant
    decision-making authority over unionized staff when he worked in Hornepayne
    where there was no higher-level manager within a several hundred mile radius. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CNs
    secondary line of attack against the proposed common issue of misclassification
    involved adducing evidence intended to refute the plaintiffs assertion that
    FLSs were not properly classified as managers. CN offered evidence showing the
    following attributes of FLSs, as described by the motion judge, at paras. 68-69: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span

    unionized employees. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Many FLSs undergo extensive training to acquire the management

    vacation schedule, to complete job performance appraisals, to administer
    collective agreements and to oversee compliance with safety legislation.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed, the success of the proposed class action is contingent on the
    threshold issue whether CN misclassified FLSs as managerial employees. The
    overarching dispositive question on appeal is whether the allegation of
    misclassification raises a certifiable common issue. In resolving this

    the parties: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span

    Motion Judge Err by Creating a New Test for Certification?</a></h2>
  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Plaintiffs Submissions</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff contends that the motion judge erred by applying a new test for
    certifying common issues. The relevant passage from the motion judges reasons
    states, at paras. 301-302:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That the some basis in fact test is a necessary but not
    sufficient condition for certification makes sense because the criteria for
    certification are not just factual matters. In so far as the criteria are
    factual, the plaintiff is more favourably treated than is the defendant.
    However, all the criteria are issues of mixed fact and law, and the legal and policy
    side of the class definition, commonality, preferability, and the adequacy of
    the representative plaintiff are matters of argument and not just facts,
    although there must be a factual basis for the arguments. While defendants may
    have to push the evidentiary burden up a steep hill, they are on a level
    playing field with the plaintiffs in arguing the law and policy of whether the
    various criteria have been satisfied.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Applying the some basis in fact test to the case at bar, Mr.
    McCracken must show that there is some basis in fact for his cause of action
    and some basis in fact for each of the certification criteria other than the
    first one. CN, however, if it is able to do so, may show that there is no
    evidentiary basis for the claims or the certification criteria. If the
    evidentiary basis is established, then whether the certification criteria have
    been satisfied remains a matter of argument between Mr. McCracken and CN on a
    level playing field.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff interprets the motion judges comment that the some basis in fact
    test is a necessary but not sufficient condition for certification to mean
    that the motion judge not only required him to show some basis in fact for the
    proposed common issues, but that he also imposed an additional burden of proving,
    on a balance of probabilities, and as a matter of law and policy, that a common
    issue ought to be certified. According to the plaintiff, the motion judge
    viewed this additional burden as levelling the playing field between
    plaintiffs and defendants on a certification motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff complains that the motion judges approach to establishing
    commonality is unsupported by any class action jurisprudence and is at odds
    with the purpose of class proceedings.  He contends that the motion judge failed
    to certify the proposed misclassification issue because he confused what should
    have been a factual analysis with a legal and policy analysis. </p>
  <h6>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Motion Judge Did Not
    Apply a New Test for Certification</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    some basis in fact principle is meant to address two concerns. First, there
    is a requirement that, for all but the cause of action criterion, an
    evidentiary foundation is needed to support a certification order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in keeping with the procedural scheme of the <em>CPA</em>, the use of the word
    some conveys the meaning that the evidentiary record need not be exhaustive,
    and certainly not a record upon which the merits will be argued. This
    legislative intention is reflected in s. 2(3)(a) of the <em>CPA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, which</span></em>  although honoured more often in
    the breach  requires the proposed representative plaintiff to bring a motion
    for certification within 90 days of the filing of, or the expiry of the time
    for filing of, a statement of defence or notice of intent. Thereafter, leave of
    the court is required to bring the motion: see s. 2(3)(b).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the exception of the motion judges suggestion that the some basis in fact
    test applies to the cause of action requirement in s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>CPA</em>,
    his reasons do not bear out the plaintiffs suggestion that he imposed an
    additional and unprecedented burden of proof on the plaintiff at the
    certification stage. In my view, the motion judge was simply explaining that
    the legal principles governing the criteria for certification have to be
    considered in the context of the evidentiary record filed in support of the
    motion. It is clear from <em>Hollick</em><i> </i>that, were it otherwise, the
    certification criteria would be argued in the air.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=verdana><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>An
    example of what the motion judge meant by his comment that the some basis in
    fact test is a necessary but not sufficient condition for certification is
    provided by the preferable procedure analysis in <em>Caputo v. Imperial Tobacco
    Ltd.</em> (2001), 236 D.L.R. (4th) 348 (Ont. S.C.J.). The court there stated,
    at para. 67: [I]<span class=verdana><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>n
    as much as the defendants cannot simply assert to any effect that there are
    other procedures that would be preferable without an evidentiary basis, neither
    can the plaintiffs satisfy the onus with argument alone. It must be supported
    by some evidence. </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    point applies equally to the common issues criterion in s. 5(1)(c) of the <em>CPA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em> In assessing whether there is some
    basis in the evidence to establish the existence of common issues, the motion
    judge must consider the pertinent legal principles that apply to the
    commonality assessment with reference to the evidence adduced on the motion.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, the notable exception is that the some basis in fact test does not
    apply to the first criterion in s. 5(1)(a) that the pleadings disclose a cause
    of action. This criterion does not require the plaintiff to lead evidence
    showing a basis in fact for the allegations in the pleadings: see <em>Hollick</em>,
    at para. 25. The pleadings must contain sufficient factual allegations to
    establish the necessary elements of the cause of action asserted. However,
    unless the allegations of fact are patently ridiculous or incapable of proof,
    the facts must be accepted as pleaded for the purpose of determining if the
    plaintiff has stated a viable cause of action. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not clear to me what the motion judge had in mind with his remarks about the
    plaintiff and defendant being on a level playing field on the certification
    motion. However, I do not accept the plaintiffs submission that the motion
    judge imposed an impermissibly higher burden on him to show commonality. The
    motion judge found that the misclassification issue required individual
    assessments of the class members. For the reasons that follow, I agree with his
    conclusion on this point. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff contends that misclassification cases are inherently amenable to
    resolution by way of class proceeding. In support of this view, he relies on <em>obiter</em> comments by the motion judges in <em>Fulawka v. Bank of Nova Scotia</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em>2010 ONSC 1148, 101 O.R. (3d) 93, and in <em>Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</em> <em><span

    about misclassification class actions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    also points to a substantial body of decisions by the Canadian Industrial
    Relations Board and its predecessor, the Canadian Labour Relations Board
    (collectively, the Board), which he says show that group-wide determinations
    of managerial classification can be made: <em>Re Algoma Central Marine</em>, 2010

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff then argues that the motion judge was satisfied that the evidence
    shows some basis in fact to find that the misclassification issue can be
    determined on a class-wide basis. He especially relies on the motion judges
    following statements, at paras. 70 and 293:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For his part, Mr. McCracken provided evidence about the role of
    first line supervisors, and his evidence shows that there is some basis in fact
    for his allegations that first line supervisors are not managers under the <em>Code</em>.
    There is evidence that at least some of them: (a) do not have authority to
    hire, terminate, promote, demote, or transfer employees; (b) do not represent
    management in collective bargaining or in grievance procedures; (c)&nbsp;have
    limited authority to discipline restricted to investigating and recommending
    minor discipline; and (d) are not involved in setting budgets, CN policies, or
    its Service Plan.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>                                      </p>
  <p class=CQuote>... Mr. McCracken has provided some basis in fact for the
    proposition that all first line managers are non-managers. Therefore, he might
    assert that the commonality of the first line supervisors is established as a
    common issue to be decided at the common issues trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff says that, having made these factual findings, the motion judge erred
    by refusing to certify his proposed misclassification issue given that this
    issue is indisputably a substantial and necessary ingredient of each class
    members claim.  </p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion Judge Did Not Err by Concluding that the Plaintiffs Proposed
    Misclassification Issue Cannot be Determined on a Class-wide Basis </h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three flaws in the plaintiffs argument: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(i) the cases he relies on do not
    establish that misclassification cases are inherently amenable to resolution by
    way of a class action; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(ii) the motion judge did not find a
    basis in fact showing that the plaintiffs proposed misclassification issue
    could be resolved commonly; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(iii) the plaintiffs evidence fails to
    establish the existence of a common issue of misclassification.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    discuss each flaw in turn.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='line-height:normal'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Misclassification cases
    are not necessarily appropriate for certification </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff relies on Strathy J.s statement in <em>Fulawka</em>, at para. 145,
    that: misclassification cases are appropriate for certification due to
    commonality of employment functions and common treatment by the employer. He
    also relies on the following comments by Lax J. in <em>Fresco</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 54,</span></em> distinguishing
    misclassification cases from the claim for overtime wages in the proceeding
    before her:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A useful place to begin is to compare the kind of claim that is
    advanced in this proceeding with the kind of claims that are advanced in the
    misclassification cases. <em>In those cases, commonality arises from the
    employees identical or similar job duties and the determination by the employer
    that it is not required to pay overtime to employees with these duties.</em> The question for the common issues judge is whether the employees duties
    entitle them to overtime within the meaning of the applicable statutes and
    regulations. This can be assessed without examining individual claims. Success
    for one does mean success for all... [Emphasis added. Footnote and citation
    omitted.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    comments do not assist the plaintiff. I agree with the motion judges
    observation, at para. 385, that these comments cannot be taken as a categorical
    assertion that every misclassification case is inevitably certifiable as a
    class action. On the contrary, these comments make it clear that
    misclassification cases are amenable to certification where the similarity of
    job duties performed by class members provides the fundamental element of
    commonality. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    after the present appeal was argued, Strathy J. released a decision refusing to
    certify a proposed class action for unpaid overtime: see <em>Brown v. Canadian
    Imperial Bank of Commerce</em>, 2012 ONSC 2377, [2012] O.J. No. 1853. That
    action was based on the allegation that the defendant bank had misclassified class
    members as managerial employees. Strathy J. concluded that the actual job
    duties performed by the members of the proposed class differed significantly,
    which would make it impossible to assess on a common basis whether the
    defendant bank had properly classified them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board decisions that the plaintiff relies on likewise do not support his
    position. In these cases, the Board made determinations of managerial status
    under s. 3 of Part I of the <em>Code</em> for the purpose of deciding if
    employees should be included in the bargaining unit. Employees who perform
    management functions are excluded from the collective bargaining rights
    conferred by Part I of the <em>Code</em> because the definition of employee
    in s. 3 <em><span style='font-style:normal'>excludes persons who perform
    management functions from the protection of Part I</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> A
    review of these decisions  and other Board decisions that CN cites reveals
    that the Board has made group-wide determinations of managerial status in cases
    where the job tasks of the affected employees are defined by a common job
    description and where there was no dispute that the employees perform similar
    tasks, or where the parties consented to a group determination by the Board:
    see e.g. <em>Algoma Central,</em> at para. 13; <em>NorthwesTel</em>, at paras.
    10-14; and <em>Vancouver Wharves Ltd</em>., [1975] 1 Can L.R.B.R. 162. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the plaintiffs proposed reading of these decisions, in <em>Island Telephone</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, the Board indicated that it carefully reviewed the
    individual circumstances of the employees in question. </span></em>In addition,
    where the case involves classifying numerous positions and where there are
    varying levels of responsibility between positions and within the same
    position, the Board has received extensive oral and documentary evidence to
    determine whether a particular employees position is managerial in nature: see,
    e.g., <em>Canada Post Corp.</em> (1989), 79 di 35 (CLRB no. 767); <i>Canadian
    Union of Bank Employees v. Bank of Nova Scotia</i> (1977), 21 di 439 (CLRB no.
    91); and <i>Quebecair</i>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>Moreover, even in cases where the employees job
    descriptions were substantially similar, the Board considered the particular circumstances
    of individual employees in isolated locations and concluded that, unlike
    employees in more centralized work places who reported to higher-level managers,
    the employees in more isolated locations actually performed management
    functions: see <em>Québec-Téléphone</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    at para. 40; </span>British Columbia Telephone Co. </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(1977), 33 di 361 (CLRB No. 98), at p. 378</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='line-height:normal'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The motion judge did not find a basis
    in fact showing that the plaintiffs proposed misclassification issue could be resolved
    commonly</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second shortcoming in the plaintiffs argument is his contention that the
    motion judge found there is a basis in fact establishing that the
    misclassification issue could be resolved on a class-wide basis. The plaintiff
    relies on the motion judges comment that his evidence shows that there is
    some basis in fact for his allegations that [FLSs] are not managers under the <em>Code</em>.
    However, the motion judge tempered this observation with his ensuing comment,
    at para. 70, that there is evidence that <em>at least some of them</em> do
    not exercise managerial functions (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    while the motion judge said, at para. 293, that Mr. McCracken has provided
    some basis in fact for the proposition that all first line managers are
    non-managers, he concluded that same paragraph with the following remark: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>However, as I will explain later in these Reasons for Decision,
    accepting Mr.&nbsp;McCrackens submission as correct is to accept as a given
    truth something that is patently or obviously untrue because there are some
    questions that are not common issues and rather are fundamentally or
    intrinsically or unavoidably individual questions.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Following up on this point, the motion judge later
    said, at para. 333, that: [t]he common label of being a first line supervisor
    tells almost nothing about entitlement [to overtime pay] under the <em>Code</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    when his reasons are viewed in their entirety, I do not think that the motion
    judge can accurately be said to have found that there is a basis in fact
    showing that the plaintiffs proposed misclassification issue could be
    determined on behalf of the entire class.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"

    filed evidence from multiple class members indicating that they do not have
    real decision-making authority and asserting that CN has misclassified them as
    managers or as employees who exercise managerial functions. However, to raise
    common issues, more is required than simply showing that some members of the
    class have similar claims. This point was made in <em>Lau v. Bayview Landmark
    Inc.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (1999), 40 C.P.C. (4th) 301 (Ont.

    litigated as a class action. The claims that those individuals could assert

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To satisfy the
    commonality requirement in s. 5(1)(c) of the <em>CPA</em>, the evidence must

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs
    proposed misclassification common issue asks:</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff is
    required to show that there is a basis in fact to find that this proposed common
    issue satisfies the apposite legal principles concerning commonality, which are
    repeated here for ease of reference (citations omitted): </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The underlying foundation of a common issue is whether its
    resolution will avoid duplication of fact-finding or legal analysis.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>With regard to the common issues, success for one member must
    mean success for all. All members of the class must benefit from the successful
    prosecution of the action, although not necessarily to the same extent. That
    is, the answer to a question raised by a common issue for the plaintiff must be
    capable of extrapolation, in the same manner, to each member of the class.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A common issue cannot be dependent upon individual findings of
    fact that have to be made with respect to each individual claimant.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=prompt><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Common

    principles to be satisfied in the context of a proposed common issue of

    find that the job functions and duties of class members are sufficiently
    similar that the misclassification element of the claim against CN could be
    resolved without considering the individual circumstances of class members. In
    the absence of such evidence, there is no basis in fact to find that resolving
    the proposed common issue would avoid duplication of fact-finding or legal
    analysis, or that success for one class member will mean success for all, or
    that individual findings of fact would not be required with respect to each
    individual claimant. Likewise, in the absence of this type of evidence, the
    requirement that the common issue should not be framed in overly broad terms is

    evidence, as summarized above at paras. 62-64, includes affidavits from class
    members who held several different FLS positions. This evidence indicates that
    these class members lacked real decision-making authority in managerial
    matters, including the powers of hiring and firing, imposing discipline, and
    setting budgets and policies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These class
    members spoke more generally about the duties and responsibilities of other
    FLSs  including ones they had worked with or ones they had spoken to. However,
    even in this latter respect, the affiants assertions are not evidence that a
    court could rely on as establishing a basis in fact for the existence of a
    common issue of misclassification because the assertions in question are vague
    and anecdotal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For example,
    Mr. Anderson deposed: D<em><span style='font-style:normal'>uring my time at

    Mr. Anderson does not indicate what FLS job positions he is referring to, the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Equally vague

    Caissie does not identify the various colleagues he spoke with, nor indicate the
    positions held by the other FLSs to which he refers. He also fails to explain
    why these colleagues were well-positioned to comment on the level of

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even considering
    rule 39.01(4) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, which permits an
    affidavit on a motion to contain statements of the deponents information and

    source of the information and belief: see <i>Smith v. National Money Mart
    Company</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 1507 (S.C.). In sum, these statements are simply
    bald, sweeping and conclusory assertions. They do not constitute evidence
    showing a basis in fact for the claim that the class members job duties and
    responsibilities across all of CNs workplaces are sufficiently similar that a
    common issues trial judge could determine on a class-wide basis whether CN
    properly classified them as managerial employees.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff,
    in responding to CNs evidence showing a lack of uniformity in the job duties
    and responsibilities of class members, also filed affidavits from two union
    leaders at CN: Rex Beatty and John Dinnery. Mr. Beatty has never held a FLS
    position, while Mr. Dinnery held a FLS position from 1979-1982  long before
    the start of the class period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Beatty
    described his experience working for unions representing CN employees. The
    relevant parts of his evidence are confined to observations about the authority
    of the trainmaster position, which is held by about 18 percent of current class
    members. For example, he stated: At no location do trainmasters have the
    authority to hire, discipline, or terminate employees, to negotiate contracts
    with the union, or to participate in the grievance procedure beyond its most
    preliminary stage.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Dinnerys
    evidence primarily describes his involvement with FLSs in his role as president
    of the United Steel Workers Union, Local 2004 (USW 2004). The USW 2004
    represents CN employees in the engineering division. Employees in the
    bargaining unit represented by USW 2004 are subject to Collective Agreement
    10.1, which is one of approximately 40 collective agreements governing CNs
    unionized workforce. Mr. Dinnery said: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Because the Collective Agreement is the same from coast to
    coast, the authority of [FLSs] under the Agreement is similarly uniform. Based
    on my experience in the union leadership, I believe that the unions dealing
    with [FLSs] are exactly the same across Canada. Indeed, under the Collective
    Agreement, employees must be treated in the same manner by their supervisors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This evidence
    reveals several inaccuracies and limitations. First, the premise for Mr.
    Dinnerys claim that the authority of FLSs is uniform appears to be that their
    authority is defined by the collective agreement. However, the collective
    agreement only dictates the terms and conditions of the work performed by
    employees who are supervised by the FLSs. In other words, the uniformity is not
    of the supervisors but of the supervised. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, his
    statement ignores that there are different collective agreements that apply to
    the employees supervised by FLSs. Differences in the collective agreement
    provisions concerning matters such as imposing discipline, lay-offs, and
    setting hours of work undermine the premise of uniformity in the FLSs
    authority. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Mr.
    Dinnerys evidence is limited to discussing the role of FLSs in CNs
    engineering division. He says nothing about the role of FLSs in the
    transportation or mechanical departments, or in the areas of sales and
    marketing or support services. His evidence is further limited to describing
    the role played by FLSs in imposing discipline and participating in the
    grievance process. In the former respect, he acknowledged that under the
    collective agreement with USW 2004, FLSs have authority to impose up to 15
    demerit points for minor infractions without needing authorization from higher
    management to do so, subject to the employees right to request a formal
    investigation by more senior management. Mr. Dinnery did not discuss the other
    indicia of management functions, such as the extent of FLSs authority over
    matters such as budgeting, scheduling hours of work, deciding staffing levels,
    ordering lay-offs, or participating in policy-making. </p>

style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The lack of evidence of job descriptions
    for FLS positions</span></strong></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the certification
    motion, there was no evidence in the form of job descriptions for the various
    FLS positions. Class counsel asked CNs representative, Mr. Lagacé, to
    undertake to provide copies of the various job descriptions [for FLSs] in the
    various salary grades as they existed in 1999.  CN refused on the basis that
    the undertaking was not within the proper scope of a cross-examination on an
    affidavit and on the basis that it is not relevant to the issues before the
    court. The plaintiff did not bring a refusals motion to compel the requested
    undertaking. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN asserts on
    appeal that it does not have any formal job descriptions for FLS positions. In
    oral argument, the plaintiff asked the court to draw an adverse inference on
    this point because of CNs refusal to provide any documentation in response to
    the questions put to the deponent.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[13]</span></span></span></span></a> However, there is no adverse inference that could be drawn that would advance
    the plaintiffs request to certify the action. Evidence of job descriptions is
    only relevant to the commonality criterion. In considering as a whole the
    evidence of the nature of the job functions performed by class members, the
    court cannot go so far as to infer that each job is identical or substantially
    similar. CN has adduced evidence to the contrary suggesting that individuals
    with the same job title had different duties and responsibilities. </p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>(d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></strong><strong><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff 
    in apparent recognition of the lack of evidence showing sufficient commonality
    of the job functions and responsibilities of class members  suggested on
    appeal that the misclassification issue could be adjudicated based on
    sub-groups. However, he did not offer any concrete guidance on how to
    sub-divide the class, such as by way of job title, or by the location where
    class members worked (e.g., urban centres versus more isolated areas). Instead,
    the plaintiff suggested using the sub-groups that the motion judge identified
    in approved common issue 3, namely: (1) class members who clearly meet the
    minimum managerial criteria; (2) those who clearly could not meet these
    criteria; and (3) those whose status remains to be determined. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the
    plaintiffs suggested lines of division would not assign individual class
    members to a particular sub-group. The common issues trial judge would need to
    identify the indicia of managerial functions and would then need to apply these
    indicia to members of the class, without any assurance that this application
    could be done commonly, that is, without the need to examine the individual
    circumstances of most, if not all, of the 1,550 class members.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reply
    factum, the plaintiff contends that a trial judge would substantially advance
    the case for all class members by making a class-wide determination of the
    various indicia of management that are relevant within the organizational and
    operational context of CN. He goes on to identify three possible scenarios that
    might arise after the trial judge identifies these criteria:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In particular, a trial judge could substantially advance the
    case for all class members by first making a class-wide determination of the
    various indicia of management <em><span style='font-style:normal'>specifically
    relevant within the organizational and operational context of CN</span></em><i>.</i> A trial judge could then make one of several determinations depending on the
    evidence led at trial. <em>One determination would be to move to an individual
    assessment process in which the common issues judge could use the considerable
    resources of the CPA to achieve manageable individual proceedings in order to
    determine, on a principled and consistent basis, which of the class members (or
    groups of class members) are not management.</em> A second determination could
    find that the class as a whole, or sub-groups within the class, do or do not
    have sufficient independent authority under the above criteria to qualify as
    management. A third determination could be that some of the common indicia may
    be determined, on a class-wide basis, leaving only limited individual
    inquiries. [Footnotes omitted. Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next section
    of my reasons explains why determining the various indicia of management will
    not substantially advance the case for all class members. I make three
    observations about the plaintiffs position in reply.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the
    plaintiffs Revised List did not refer anywhere to the need for the trial judge
    to identify the legal and factual criteria for deciding whether class members were
    properly classified as managerial employees. In submitting that a trial judge
    could substantially advance the case for all class members by first making a
    class-wide determination of the various indicia of management, the plaintiff
    is arguing, in effect, that the action should be certified so that the common
    issues trial judge can determine what the common issues should be. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a conceptual
    level, the plaintiffs approach is fundamentally wrong. The sentiment expressed
    in <em>Caputo</em>, at para. 56, applies here: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he judge presiding over the common issues trial is there
    in the role of arbiter of issues that have already been set out. That role is
    to make findings with respect to issues certified for trial, rather than to
    decide what issues are to be resolved. Setting the issues for trial is the role
    of the motions judge on certification.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words,
    it is a misapplication of the <em>CPA</em> to certify an action where the
    common issues trial judge is expected to formulate the issues for trial. I
    would add that while the motion judge on certification may amend or revise
    common issues, it is the plaintiff who bears the responsibility at first
    instance for proposing the common issues and for adducing evidence
    demonstrating that those issues exist. The plaintiff must not abdicate this
    responsibility in the hope that the motion judge will formulate certifiable
    issues. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the
    plaintiffs submissions reveal a practical defect. The plaintiff speaks of the
    common issues trial judge making determinations of the indicia of management
    that are specifically relevant within the organizational and operational
    context of CN. However, the evidentiary record reveals that the
    organizational and operational context of CN differs for individual class
    members depending on factors such as which FLS job title they hold, where they
    work and whether they work alongside other FLSs or higher-level managers. The
    effect of this evidence is that there are no common issues but rather an
    amalgam of individual assessments. As stated by Cullity J. in <em>Risorto v.
    State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</em><i> </i>(2007), <a
name=reflex-caselaw-71425253></a>38 C.P.C. (6th) 373 (Ont. S.C.), at para 45:
    [i]f an issue is one that the court at trial could decide only by reference to
    the facts relating to the claim of each class member, it lacks commonality.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the
    plaintiff acknowledges in these submissions that, after the common issues trial
    judge identifies the indicia of managerial status, one determination would be
    to move to an individual assessment process for deciding which of the class
    members are not management. This acknowledgement amounts to a full and complete
    answer to the certification requirement in s. 5(1)(c) because it is an admission
    that the plaintiffs evidence does not provide a basis in fact to find that the
    misclassification issue can be resolved without the need for individual
    assessments of class members.   </p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>(f)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Summary</span></strong></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The plaintiffs
    litigation strategy seizes on the superficial commonality that all class
    members work for CN and all share the common label of being a FLS. However, this
    common label conveys a false impression of commonality given the evidence on
    the motion of the different job responsibilities and functions of class members,
    who hold many different job titles and who work in a variety of workplaces with
    different reporting structures and different sizes of workforce. There is no
    basis in fact to support a finding that the essential misclassification
    determination could be made without resorting to the evidence of individual
    class members. Simply put, the plaintiff has not shown that any significant
    element of his claim is capable of common proof. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, determining
    the minimum requirements to be a managerial employee at CN would not advance
    the claims of class members in any significant way.  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'><a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did the Motion Judge Err by Reframing a Common Issue Concerning
    the Minimum Requirements to be a Managerial Employee at CN?</a> </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    rejected the plaintiffs proposed misclassification common issues on the basis
    that they lacked commonality. Having done so, he drew up a set of revised
    common issues for certification, at para. 351, which included the following
    common issue:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In accordance with the meaning under s. 167 (2) of the<span
class=apple-converted-space><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;[</span></span><em>Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>]</span></em>, of employees who are managers or
    superintendents or exercise management functions, what are the minimum
    requirements to be a managerial employee at CN?</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The motion judge held that this minimum requirements
    issue could be determined on a class-wide basis and that resolving it would
    substantially advance the litigation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree
    with the motion judges conclusion that the issue he proposed is a certifiable
    common issue. The motion judge rejected the plaintiffs various formulations of
    a misclassification common issue based on his finding that the element of
    commonality is lacking. In that, he was correct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the motion
    judge fell into error was in attempting to recast common issues that were, in
    his view, amenable to certification. Despite his efforts to reformulate the
    common issues, the evidentiary shortcomings remained. A core of commonality
    either exists on the record or it does not. In other words, commonality is not
    manufactured through the statement of common issues. The common issues are
    derived from the facts and from the issues of law arising from the causes of
    action asserted by class members and not the other way around. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the absence
    of a common issues trial that would be able to resolve the threshold
    misclassification issue, determining the issue of the minimum indicia of
    management  or on the motion judges formulation, the minimum requirements
    for being a managerial employee at CN  would not advance the proceeding in any
    significant way. The motion judge seemingly acknowledged this point, as
    reflected by his remarks, at para. 359, that the heart of the matter remains
    whether the first line supervisors were or were not managers, which is
    unanswered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In attempting to
    state common issues that would minimally advance the proceeding on a class-wide
    basis, the motion judge lost sight of the fact that the plaintiffs action for
    unpaid overtime is fundamentally a misclassification case. Answering the motion
    judges revised common issues would not eliminate the need for substantial
    individual inquiries to determine whether  having regard to the specific job
    duties and responsibilities of class members and the organizational context in
    which each works  CN had properly or improperly classified FLSs as managerial
    employees. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the absence
    of an evidentiary basis for certifying a common issue that would resolve the
    misclassification allegation, the proposed class action for unpaid overtime
    wages simply collapses. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> On the Rule 21
    motion, the motion judge concluded that the Superior Court of Justice has
    jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of Part III of the <em>Code</em> pertaining to overtime and holiday pay. He reached this conclusion based on his
    view that the <em>Code</em> provisions are terms of CNs employment contracts
    by force of statute. CN contends that this conclusion is in error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Given that I
    see no basis in fact for the proposed common issue of misclassification, it is
    not necessary to consider the parties arguments concerning jurisdiction. Nor
    is it necessary to consider CNs submission that the motion judge should have
    struck the plaintiffs claims for breach of contract for failing to state a
    proper cause of action. However, in not addressing these issues, I do not wish
    to be understood as endorsing the motion judges reasons on them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties also
    object to the following rulings by the motion judge on the Rule 21 motion and
    on the certification motion:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. Did the motion judge err in staying
    the plaintiffs claims for breach of express or implied terms of the class
    members contracts of employment?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. Did the motion judge err in
    dismissing the plaintiffs claim for holiday pay?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. Did the motion judge err in striking
    the plaintiffs pleading in negligence for policy reasons without the benefit
    of a proper record?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>4. Did the motion judge err in refusing
    to certify the proposed common issue concerning contractual terms?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5. Did the motion judge err in refusing
    to certify any of the proposed common issues concerning the duty in contract,
    the duty of good faith, and a duty in tort? </p>
  <p class=CQuote>6. Did the motion judge err in finding
    that an aggregate assessment of damages would not be available?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>7. Did the motion judge err in finding
    on the certification motion that a class proceeding would be the preferable
    procedure? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, given my
    reasons on the absence of a proper common issue concerning the fundamental
    question of misclassification, it is not necessary to assess these questions
    individually. However, as the first five of these questions point to a common
    theme about the scope of a motion judges authority on a Rule 21 motion and on
    an accompanying motion for certification, I make the following comments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    made the following rulings and observations that, in my view, misconstrue the
    extent of his authority under the <em>Rules</em> and under the relevant
    provisions of the <em>CPA</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A consequence of the certification and Rule 21 motions is that
    several common issues will have already been determined (at para. 14). </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The function of a Rule 21 motion is not to adjudicate the genuine
    merits of a claim or defence, but there is a way on any motion to obtain
    judgment on the merits by way of a motion for judgment. It is appropriate to
    use the motion for judgment jurisdiction under rule 37.13(2) in this case to
    dismiss the plaintiffs claim for holiday pay on the merits (at paras.
    211-12).   </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is also appropriate to use the motion for judgment
    jurisdiction and the jurisdiction provided by ss. 12 and 13 of the&nbsp;<em>CPA</em><i> </i>to decide common issues on their merits before the common issues trial (at
    paras. 228-31).</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It would be propitious to the advancement of the class action and
    fair to both the class members and CN to exercise the courts jurisdiction to
    decide that the terms of the <em>Code </em>are terms of the employment
    contracts by force of law (at para. 232).</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plaintiffs claims for breach of express or implied contract

  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Four of the six questions on the list of approved common issues
    can and should be answered before the common issues trial and these answers,
    which are readily available, would substantially advance the class members
    litigation against CN (at para. 353). </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The answer to common issue two is now known as a by-product of
    CNs motion under rule 20.01(3)(a). The answer to the question is that
    compliance with the overtime provisions of the<span

    contracts of employment between CN and the FLSs (at para. 357). </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Answering common issue two substantially advances the litigation
    and makes it unnecessary or moot to answer several factually or legally more
    difficult questions (at para. 357).</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Common issues four and five<b> </b>are subjunctive tense
    questions that are readily answered in the subjunctive. On the assumption that
    CN did not pay overtime pay when it was required to do so and on the assumption
    that CNs as yet unpleaded defence failed at the common issues trial, then the
    requirements for an unjust enrichment claim would be satisfied at the common
    issues trial and CN would have to disgorge its ill-gotten gains, once those
    gains had been calculated (at para. 358). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While a Rule 21
    motion permits a motion judge to find that a pleaded cause of action is wholly
    without merit, a motion judge should not convert such a motion into a motion
    for judgment using rule 37.13(2)(a) unless the parties agree that all relevant
    evidence is before the court and they have had a full opportunity to argue
    their positions on the motion for judgment: see <em>Royal Bank of Canada v.
    Rastogi</em>, 2011 ONCA 47, at para. 22, citing <em>CMLQ Investors Company v.
    CIBC Trust Corporation</em> <a name="reflex_caselaw_69294666"></a>(1996), 3
    C.P.C. (4th) 62 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 8. Those circumstances did not exist
    here. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I agree
    that the provisions in ss. 12 and 13 of the <em>CPA</em> confer jurisdiction on
    a certification judge to decide the common issues before the common issues
    trial. Section 12 is a purely procedural provision that allows a motion judge
    to make orders concerning the conduct of a class action, while s. 13 empowers a
    motion judge to stay a related proceeding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    deciding common issues on the certification motion is antithetical to the
    well-established principle enshrined in <em>Hollick</em>, at para. 16, that the
    decision to certify a class action is not a decision on the merits of the
    action. A key reason for this is that the evidentiary record at the certification
    stage is far from complete.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that
    the motion judge fundamentally altered the plaintiffs proposed common issues.
    While this is a power that may be exercised by the motion judge, it should be
    exercised with caution and restraint and should be the exception rather than
    the norm.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given his
    decision to refashion the common issues, the motion judge granted certification
    subject to the condition that a litigation plan be settled. In my view, motion
    judges should not, as a matter of common practice, bifurcate the requirement in
    s. 5(1)(e)(ii) of the <em>CPA</em> to produce a plan for the proceeding that
    sets out a workable method of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the class.
    Nor should the litigation plan requirement be treated as a mere afterthought. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Preparing a litigation
    plan requires the plaintiff to translate his or her analytical proposal for a
    class proceeding into practice by having to explain, in concrete terms, the
    process whereby the common issues, and any remaining individual issues, will be
    decided. The need for a clear explanation of how a proposed common issue would
    be resolved for all class members on a common basis serves as an important
    check in considering if the plaintiff has met the common issues and preferable
    procedure criteria.   </p>

    dismissed. Given my proposed disposition of the appeals from the certification

    s. 6 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43</span></em>. The parties both filed motions for leave to
    appeal in the Divisional Court from the motion judges order certifying the
    action as a class proceeding. In addition, both parties appealed to this court
    from the motion judges order under rules 21.01(1) and (3) of the <em>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</em> dismissing part of the plaintiffs claim. The defendant
    sought leave to appeal the interlocutory parts of the Rule 21 order to the
    Divisional Court and cross-appealed as of right from the final elements of that
    order to this court. The defendant also sought leave to appeal to the
    Divisional Court from the motion judges costs order on the motions. On consent
    of the parties, leave to appeal to the Divisional Court from the interlocutory
    parts of the motion judges Rule 21 order, and his certification and costs
    orders, was granted by orders of Jennings J., dated December 14, 2010. Pursuant
    to a consent order of Doherty J.A., dated February 9, 2011, the appeals as of

    Officer from 1997-2006 and his affidavit focuses on this time period. This
    particular job title does not appear on the list of 70 FLS job categories as of
    April 1, 2008, which CN filed in evidence.</p>

    manager of dispatchers and crew clerks in Michigan, U.S.A. He also held the position
    of trainmaster, first in Michigan, and later in Windsor and Sarnia. To the
    extent that Mr. Andersons comments relate to his experience while working as a
    FLS in Michigan, it is not admissible evidence in the proposed class action.
    The class consists only of FLS employees at CNs Canadian operations.</p>

    has met the low standard of showing that there is some basis in fact for his
    proposed common issues.  However, this comment must be read in light of his
    finding, at para. 331, that the plaintiffs proposed misclassification question
     together with various other of his proposed questions on the Revised List 
    cannot be determined on a class-wide basis and rather require individual
    questions to be answered.  </p>

    of trainmaster. The record includes a 2007 report by an inspector with Human
    Resources and Social Development Canada under Part III of the <i>Code</i>,
    regarding his investigation of a trainmasters complaint that he was improperly
    excluded from the overtime provisions of the <em>Code</em> because CN
    misclassified him as a manager. The inspector commented:  It is my
    determination, after reviewing the comments made by both parties, <em>the job
    descriptions of the Trainmaster submitted by both Mr. [H] and CN Rail</em> and
    the above-noted cases, ... that Mr. [H] did perform sufficient managerial
    functions to warrant his exclusion from the Hours of Work provision of the <em>Code</em>
    (emphasis added). </p>
