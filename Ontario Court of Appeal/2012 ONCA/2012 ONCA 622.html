  <p class=Judge>Sharpe J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These applications for judicial review of ministerial extradition
    surrender orders require us to consider the relevance of an accuseds
    Aboriginal background in the context of extradition. The tragic personal and
    family histories and current circumstances of both applicants closely
    correspond with many of the systemic factors identified by the Supreme Court in <em>R. v. Gladue,</em> [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, as requiring special consideration
    on account of the crisis in the Canadian criminal justice system arising from
    the disproportionate incidence of incarceration amongst Aboriginal peoples.
    Both applicants are sought for extradition to face drug charges in the United States, where their Aboriginality and the <em>Gladue</em> principles will not be
    considered. They both could be prosecuted in Canada for the conduct that gave
    rise to the charges in the United States. They face the prospect of
    significantly harsher sentences in the United States than they would face if
    prosecuted in Canada.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Minister of Justice concluded that the
    applicants Aboriginal status and the </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> principles were not relevant to his consideration of their s. 6(1) </span><em>Charter </em><span lang=EN-US>right to remain in Canada. The applicants submit that
    that conclusion was wrong in law and that the Ministers consideration of s.
    6(1) was legally flawed. The Minister did consider </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> factors in assessing the applicants s. 7 </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN-US> claims. However, he decided that surrendering them to the United
    States would not shock the conscience as being contrary to the principles of
    fundamental justice in violation their right to liberty and security of the
    person Nor, he concluded, would surrender be unjust or oppressive under s. 44(1)(a)
    of the </span><em>Extradition Act</em>, S.C. 1999, c. 18<em> </em>(the Act)<span
lang=EN-US>. The applicants submit that those decisions were both wrong in law
    and unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leonard also appeals his committal order pursuant to s. 49 of the Act,
    submitting that <span lang=EN-US>the extradition judge erred by concluding that
    there was sufficient evidence to justify his committal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <h5><span lang=X-NONE>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=X-NONE>Leonard</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leonard is sought by the United States of America to face trial on a
    charge of drug trafficking. Leonard and his older cousin, Stacy Peterson, were
    arrested upon entry into the United States on April 5, 2006, after customs
    officials found approximately 46,000 ecstasy pills hidden in the van in which
    they were travelling. Peterson, who was driving the van, pleaded guilty to the U.S. drug charges, agreed to testify against Leonard and others, and was given a 30-month
    sentence. Leonard fled the United States, in violation of his terms of release,
    and returned to Canada. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The United States sought his extradition on June 19, 2008. On July 9,
    2008 the Minister of Justice issued an Authority to Proceed (ATP) specifying
    the corresponding Canadian offence, trafficking in a Schedule III substance,
    contrary to s. 5(1) of the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>, S.C.
    1996, c. 19. On June 3, 2010, Leonard was committed for extradition and, on
    April 14, 2011, the Minister of Justice ordered his surrender. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leonard was 18 years old at the time of the alleged offence. He has no
    adult criminal record. He is a Canadian citizen and a member of the Rainy River
    First Nations. He has resided for almost his entire life at Manitou Rapids, the
    main reserve of the Rainy River First Nations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is not disputed that Leonard has suffered from the litany of
    disadvantages that the Supreme Court of Canada has attributed to Canadas sorry history of discrimination and neglect in relation to Aboriginal peoples.
    Leonard was exposed to adult substance abuse throughout his childhood. His
    mother was an alcoholic and died as a result of mixing pills and alcohol when he
    was 12 years old. His father, also an alcoholic, was not capable of caring for
    him and Leonards aunt and her husband became his foster parents. Leonard
    removed himself from foster care at age 15. He had access to alcohol and
    marihuana from age 12 onwards, and abused both substances during his adolescent
    years. He has two daughters. The elder, now eight years old, was born when the applicant
    was 16. The younger daughter is now three years old. Both children live at Manitou
    Rapids. Leonard shares custody of the older child with her mother and has sole
    custody of the two-year-old. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many members of Rainy River First Nations, including Leonards paternal
    grandparents and all of his maternal uncles and aunts, were victims of forced
    residential schooling. The intergenerational effects of residential school
    attendance and substance abuse feature prominently in Leonards personal
    history.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leonard attaches great importance to his Aboriginal heritage, his
    connection to his community, ancestral lands, and cultural and spiritual
    traditions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    his apprehension for extradition in 2008, Leonard has made significant
    rehabilitative efforts. He has been subject to stringent bail conditions with
    which he has fully complied. Leonard has also committed himself to parenting
    his two daughters. If he is extradited, his two-year-old daughter will have to
    be placed in foster care. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If Leonard is surrendered for extradition to the
    United States, he faces a lengthy sentence of imprisonment and the severance
    of his ties with his Aboriginal community. The presumptive sentence under the United States sentencing guidelines for the drug offence with which Leonard is charged in the United States is 15 years and 8 months to 19 years and 7 months imprisonment with no
    prospect of release until 85% of the sentence has been served. The American
    prosecutor responsible for Leonards case has stated that Leonard is likely to
    receive the presumptive sentence. The American justice system does not take
    Aboriginality into account when determining sentence and, according to the
    affidavit of the American criminal defence lawyer submitted to the Minister by
    Leonard, the U.S. prisons to which Leonard would likely be assigned if
    convicted lack culturally appropriate programs for Aboriginal inmates, </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>While the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) decided that
    extradition to the United States was preferable to laying charges against
    Leonard in Canada, it is clear that he could be prosecuted here for his
    conduct. The maximum penalty he would face for the offence of trafficking under
    the </span><em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em><span lang=EN-US> would
    be 10 years. There is no minimum penalty. Given his age, lack of criminal
    record, peripheral involvement in the offence, Aboriginal status and the
    significant rehabilitative steps he has taken since his apprehension, it is
    likely that he would receive a conditional or relatively short custodial
    sentence if convicted in Canada.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=X-NONE>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=X-NONE>Gionet</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    United States seeks Gionets extradition for prosecution in relation to his
    alleged involvement in importing oxycodone into the United States from Canada between August 2003 and July 2004 in cooperation with two Americans. Gionet was
    indicted by a grand jury in August of 2004. Two superceding indictments
    followed in December 2004 and August 2005. The United States requested Gionets
    extradition on April 19, 2006. On January 9, 2009, the Minister of Justice
    issued an Authority to Proceed. Gionet was arrested in March of 2009 and has
    been in custody since that date pending the outcome of the extradition
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 4, 2010, the extradition judge committed Gionet for surrender. The
    Minister of Justice ordered his surrender on March 18, 2010. The Minister
    confirmed his decision ordering Gionets surrender with reasons dated June 8,
    2011.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gionets
    appeal from committal was dismissed by this court on March 21, 2011: <em>United
    States of America v. Gionet</em>, 2011 ONCA 217.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gionet
    was born on July 13, 1977 in Thunder Bay. Gionet is a registered status Indian
    and a member of the Ginogaming First Nation. He describes both of his parents
    as alcoholics. His father is French Canadian and his mother is an Ojibway woman
    who is a member of the Ginogaming First Nation. Gionets mother was sent to a
    residential school with three of her siblings. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gionet
    completed high school and attended college after graduation. He has a
    common-law partner, a daughter born in 2007 and a step-son. He worked at a
    casino for three or four years but was dismissed for lateness that he
    attributes to his drug problem. He started using alcohol in grade nine and he
    now self-identifies as an alcoholic. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gionet
    began using illegal drugs in grade 11, first hashish oil and marijuana
    typically combined with alcohol. He was introduced to cocaine when he was 18 or
    19 years old and, in about 2003, he began using oxycodone in combination with cocaine.
    His use of the drug became an addiction and he acknowledges that his addiction
    to oxycodone resulted in the loss of his job, his home and his vehicle, and
    strained his personal relationships. Since 2004, Gionet has attempted to
    overcome his addiction and, while he has relapsed on occasion, since his
    incarceration for extradition he has benefited from substance abuse programmes
    and says that he has not used oxycodone. </p>

    much of the conduct underlying the offences for which he is sought occurred in Canada, Gionet could be prosecuted here. Gionet faces a more severe sentence in the United States. In support of his submission to the Minister, Gionet filed evidence to
    suggest that in the United States he faces a sentence of about 6 or 7 years on
    a guilty plea or 8 to 10 years if convicted after a trial. He submits that in Canada, the range for sentence is 3 to 5 years and that consideration of his Aboriginal
    status and the <em>Gladue</em> principles could yield a lower sentence.</p>

    determine whether there is sufficient evidence of conduct that, had it
    occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in Canada on the offence
    set out in the authority to proceed.  Leonard appeals that decision to this
    court pursuant to s. 49. As I have noted, Gionets appeal from committal has

    may be justified as a reasonable limit pursuant to s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>guarantees

    if the Minister is satisfied that</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a)&nbsp;the surrender would be unjust or oppressive having

    acquiescence in an attempt to avoid culpability as a party to the offence of
    trafficking by transporting. The inferences suggested by the Applicant, namely,
    that Leonard was available to assist Peterson, or that his presence was an
    attempt to provide a veneer of normalcy are reasonably supportable to

    their land.<em> </em>The Minister concluded that the right to remain in Canada attaches to citizenship and applies to all Canadian citizens equally. The Minister
    rejected the contention that Leonards personal circumstances, his
    Aboriginality and the <em>Gladue</em> principles had to be considered in assessing
    whether surrendering Leonard to be prosecuted in the United States was
    justified under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em> as a reasonable limit on of his s.

    the principles of fundamental justice. He rejected that submission, concluding

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Gladue</em>, the Supreme Court stated, at para. 67, that [y]ears of
    dislocation and economic development have translated, for many aboriginals,
    into low incomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or
    irrelevance of education, substance abuse, loneliness, and community fragmentation.
    These conditions, together with bias and systemic racism, have contributed to
    what the Court described, at para. 64, as a crisis in Canadas criminal justice system: the grossly disproportionate incidence of crime and incarceration
    amongst Aboriginal peoples. Section&nbsp;718.2(e) of the Criminal Code, which
    directs sentencing judges to consider alternatives to imprisonment for all
    offenders but with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal
    offenders, was interpreted in <em>Gladue</em>, at para. 33, as a direction to
    sentencing judges to undertake the process of sentencing aboriginal offenders
    differently. The Court held that a different approach was required to meet
    what it had described in <em>R. v. Williams</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128, at
    para. 58, as widespread bias against aboriginal people within Canada and evidence that this widespread racism has translated into systemic discrimination in the
    criminal justice system. In <em>Gladue</em>, the Supreme Court<em> </em>adopted
    the conclusion of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (<em>Gladue</em>,
    at para. 62) and the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba (<em>Gladue</em>,
    at para. 63) that Canada's criminal justice had failed to take into account the
    substantially different cultural values and experience of aboriginal people.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> mandates, at para. 66, a different framework of analysis for
    sentencing aboriginal offenders, taking into consideration </span>the distinct
    situation of aboriginal peoples in Canada including: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The unique systemic or background factors which may have played
    a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be
    appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her
    particular aboriginal heritage or connection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court has emphasized, however, that the focus on systemic factors and
    specially tailored sanctions does not amount to reverse discrimination in
    favour of aboriginal offenders by offering them an automatic reduction in
    sentence. To the contrary, the <em>Gladue </em>approach is intended to avoid
    the discrimination against aboriginal offenders that flows from the failure of
    the justice system to address their special circumstances. As explained in <em>Gladue</em> at paras. 87-88:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The fact that a court is called upon to take into consideration
    the unique circumstances surrounding these different parties is not unfair to
    non-aboriginal people. Rather, the fundamental purpose of s. 718.2(e) is to
    treat aboriginal offenders fairly by taking into account their difference.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he direction to consider these unique circumstances flows
    from the staggering injustice currently experienced by aboriginal peoples with
    the criminal justice system.&nbsp; The provision reflects the reality that many
    aboriginal people are alienated from this system which frequently does not
    reflect their needs or their understanding of an appropriate sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <em>Gladue</em> approach has been reinforced by <em>R. v.
    Ipeelee</em>, 2012 SCC&nbsp;13, 280 C.C.C. (3d) 265, a decision handed down
    after the Minister gave his reasons in this case. <em>Ipeelee </em>reiterates that
    the <em>Gladue</em> approach does not amount to reverse discrimination but is,
    rather an acknowledgement that to achieve real equity, sometimes different
    people must be treated differently: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 71. <em>Gladue</em> recognizes that Canadian courts have failed to take into account the unique
    circumstances of Aboriginal offenders that bear on the sentencing process and
    is intended to remedy this failure by directing judges to craft sentences in a
    manner that is meaningful to Aboriginal peoples: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 75. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    this court beyond the context of sentencing to address the need to ensure
    appropriate treatment for Aboriginal people as they interact with the justice
    system. <em>Frontenac Ventures Corp. v. Ardoch Algonquin First Nation</em>,
    2008 ONCA 534, 91 O.R. (3d) 1, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2008]
    S.C.C.A. No. 357, applying <em>Gladue</em> in the context of civil contempt of
    court, holds, at para 57: Although <em>Gladue</em> was focussed primarily on
    the serious problem of excessive imprisonment of aboriginal peoples, the case
    in a broader sense draws attention to the state of the justice systems
    engagement with Canadas First Nations. In <em>R. v. Sim </em>(2005), 78 O.R.
    (3d) 183 (C.A.) this court held, at para. 16, that the <em>Gladue</em> principles should not be limited to the sentencing process and that the Ontario

    disposition of an Aboriginal NCR accused.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicants s. 7 claims required the Minister to consider whether, in the light
    of all the circumstances, the applicants surrender would be inconsistent with
    the principles of fundamental justice and hence shock the conscience of
    Canadians. As the Supreme Court of Canada held in <em>United States v. Burns</em>,
    2001 SCC 7, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, at para. 68, the phrase shocks the
    conscience conveys the exceptional weight of a factor such as the youth,
    insanity, mental retardation or pregnancy of a fugitive that may tip the
    balance against surrender and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>should not be allowed to obscure the ultimate assessment that
    is required: namely whether or not the extradition is in accordance with the
    principles of fundamental justice. The rule is <u>not</u> that departures from
    fundamental justice are to be tolerated unless in a particular case it shocks
    the conscience. An extradition that violates the principles of fundamental
    justice will <u>always</u> shock the conscience. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the Minister appears to accept that the <em>Gladue </em>principles are relevant
    to the determination of applicants claims under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> and
    s. 44(1)(a) of the <em>Extradition Act</em>, it is my view that the Ministers
    reasons reveal that he refused to apply the <em>Gladue</em> principle that the
    interests of justice require that Aboriginal defendants be accorded special
    consideration in order to ensure that entrenched patterns of discrimination are
    not maintained and repeated. To repeat, in Leonard, the Minister stated: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>...I am also of the view that it would be unfair if Mr. Leonard
    could escape a trial on the offence alleged against him on the basis that he is
    an Aboriginal defendant or on the basis of his daughters needs when accused
    persons in Canada must generally face prosecution regardless of their heritage,
    or the fact that surrender would have a negative effect on their family. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Gionet, the Minister put it in virtually identical terms:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am of the view that it would be unfair if Mr. Gionet could
    escape a trial on the serious offences alleged against him on the basis that he
    is an Aboriginal defendant or on the basis of his familys needs when accused
    persons in Canada must generally face prosecution regardless of their heritage,
    of the fact that surrender would have a negative effect on their family.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Ministers reasons reveal two significant errors of law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Ministers reasoning rests on the proposition that to consider the
    disadvantages suffered by the applicants on account of the systemic wrongs they
    have suffered because of their Aboriginal backgrounds would be unfair to
    other accused persons. As I have already attempted to explain, <em>Gladue</em> stands for the proposition that insisting that Aboriginal defendants be treated
    as if they were exactly the same as non-Aboriginal defendants will only
    perpetuate the historical patterns of discrimination and neglect that have
    produced the crisis of criminality and over-representation of Aboriginals in
    our prisons. Yet it is on the idea of formal equality of treatment the Minister
    rests his <em>Gladue</em> analysis. That approach was soundly rejected by the
    Supreme Court in both <em>Gladue</em> and <em>Ipeelee</em>, which emphasize
    that consideration of the systemic wrongs inflicted on Aboriginals does not
    amount to discrimination in their favour or guarantee them an automatic
    reduction in sentence. Instead, <em>Gladue</em> factors must be considered in
    order to avoid the discrimination to which Aboriginal offenders are too often
    subjected and that so often flows from the failure of the justice system to
    address their special circumstances. Treating <em>Gladue</em> in this manner
    resonates with the principle of substantive equality grounded in the
    recognition that equality does not necessarily mean identical treatment and
    that the formal like treatment model of discrimination may in fact produce
    inequality: <em>R. v. Kapp</em>, 2008 S.C.C. 41, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, at para.
    15. The Minister refused to apply this basic <em>Charter</em> principle in his
    s.&nbsp;7 analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Minister posits his choice as being to either surrender the applicants to
    face justice elsewhere or to allow them to escape prosecution altogether. In my
    view, this analysis is seriously flawed. While no charges have yet been laid in
    Canada, if surrender were refused, it would certainly be open to the PPSC to
    reconsider and to lay charges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I will explain below in relation to the s.
    6(1) claim, the Ministers analysis ignores the possibility that the PPSC could
    reconsider and decide to prosecute in the event that Leonard or Gionet were not
    surrendered. Even if the Minister himself has no authority to overrule the PPSC
    decision not to lay charges in Canada, there would be nothing to stop the PPSC
    from reassessing the matter and laying charges in Canada if surrender to the
    United States is refused. By treating the choice as either surrendering the
    applicants to the United States or allowing them to escape a trial, the
    Minister has created a false dichotomy and erred in law. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    wish to emphasize again that just as <em>Gladue</em> is not a get out of jail
    free card (<em>R. v. Kakekagamick</em> (2006), 81 O.R. 3d 664 (C.A.), at para. 34), the application of <em>Gladue</em> in the context of extradition does
    not mean Aboriginal offenders get favoured treatment. To the contrary,
    application of <em>Gladue</em> is intended to guard against and avoid the
    discrimination that, as experience demonstrates, will occur where
    decision-makers fail to advert to the specific and particular problems faced by
    Aboriginal Canadians in our system of justice: see <em>Ipeelee</em>, at paras.
    67-68. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the Ministers s. 7 analysis reveals significant legal errors. As
    the Minister erred in law and failed to apply legally relevant factors, his conclusion
    that surrender would not shock the conscience is unreasonable and must be set
    aside: see <em>Lake</em>, at para. 41; <em>United States of America v. Thamby</em>,
    2011 ONCA 333, 280 O.A.C. 298, at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    my conclusion with respect to s. 7, it is not necessary for me to deal with s.

    Leonard asked that it be produced and the Minister refused on the ground that
    Leonard had been provided all the information the Minister had considered

    to review and modify the PPSC decision, although I note that the applicants
    strongly contest that assertion and the Minister concedes that wearing his
    other hat as Attorney General he would have the power to direct a prosecution.
    For present purposes, it suffices to say that for the Minister to rest his
    decision to surrender the applicants on the ground that PPSC has decided not to
    bring charges in Canada, a decision he has not reviewed, amounts to a form of

lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, I do not agree with the applicants
    submission that their Aboriginal status gives them an enhanced s. 6(1) right to
    remain in Canada. The applicants have a s. 6(1) right to remain in Canada because they are Canadian citizens. As the Minister correctly stated, the s. 6(1)
    right applies to all Canadian citizens equally. Aboriginal people do, of
    course, have rights that are not enjoyed by other Canadian citizens and that
    are protected by s. 35 of the </span><em>Constitution Act</em><span lang=EN-US>,</span><em> 1982</em><span lang=EN-US>. Those rights are derived in part from the
    distinctive relationship between Aboriginal peoples and their lands. I cannot
    agree, however, that the special connection between Aboriginal peoples and
    traditional Aboriginal lands shapes, strengthens or redefines the s. 6(1) right
    to remain in Canada, which attaches to the citizenship that Aboriginal people
    share with all other Canadians.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second s. 6(1) issue relates to the
    Ministers statement that as </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> bears upon
    sentencing and the </span><em>Cotroni</em><span lang=EN-US> analysis involves
    prosecutorial discretion, </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> need not be
    considered in relation to s. 6(1). For the following reasons, I reject the
    Ministers proposition that the </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> factors
    have no bearing on prosecutorial discretion.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>While most of the listed </span><em>Cotroni </em><span lang=EN-US>factors
    bear upon the circumstances of the offence and the feasibility of prosecution
    in Canada or elsewhere, two factors do call for consideration of the individual
    circumstances of the person sought, namely, </span>the nationality and
    residence of the accused and the severity of the sentence the accused is
    likely to receive in each jurisdiction. As the circumstances of these cases
    demonstrate, <em>Gladue</em> clearly has a bearing on the question of the
    severity of the sentence the accused is likely to receive in each jurisdiction.
    Any reasonable evaluation of the severity of the likely sentence in each
    jurisdiction must take into account the possible effect of <em>Gladue</em>. In
    Leonard, the Minister stated that only one of the factors articulated by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Cotroni</em>, the nationality and residency of
    the accused, addresses the individual circumstances of the person sought. This
    is incorrect to the extent that the persons individual circumstances affects
    the severity of the sentence likely to be received in each jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence that I have already reviewed indicates that the <em>Gladue</em> factors are not limited to criminal sentencing but that they should be
    considered by all decision&#8209;makers who have the power to influence the
    treatment of aboriginal offenders in the justice system (<em>Gladue</em> at
    para. 65) whenever an Aboriginal persons liberty is at stake in criminal and
    related proceedings. That category includes extradition. Indeed, the Minister
    himself appears to have recognized that the reach of <em>Gladue</em> extends
    beyond sentencing when he agreed that the <em>Gladue</em> principles are
    relevant to the determination of whether a sought persons personal
    circumstances would make extradition contrary to s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sound exercise of prosecutorial discretion is fundamental to the fair
    administration of criminal justice. The decisions of prosecutors have enormous
    implications for accused persons and for the justice system. Discretionary
    decision-making was identified in the <em>Report of the Aboriginal Justice
    Inquiry of Manitoba</em>, vol. 1, ch. 4 (Winnipeg: Aboriginal Justice
    Implementation Commission, 1999),  as a source of injustice to Aboriginal
    people in the criminal justice system:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Many opportunities for subjective decision making exist within
    the justice system and there are few checks on the subjective criteria being
    used to make those decisions. We believe that part of the problem is that while
    Aboriginal people are the objects of such discretion within the justice system,
    they do not benefit from discretionary decision making, and that even the
    well-intentioned exercise of discretion can lead to inappropriate results
    because of cultural or value differences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the central importance of prosecutorial discretion to the administration of
    Canadian justice and to the extradition process, I cannot accept the
    proposition that the <em>Gladue</em> principles have no bearing upon its
    exercise. In my view, the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion in this
    context requires an assessment of the likely result if the case were prosecuted
    domestically and a comparison of that result to the likely outcome in the
    foreign state if the individual sought were surrender. In the case of an
    aboriginal offender, I fail to see how that assessment and comparison could be
    accomplished without reference to the <em>Gladue</em> principles.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    wish to emphasize here that I do not wish to be taken as saying that
    application of <em>Gladue</em> somehow requires prosecutors to lay charges in Canada rather than agree to foreign proceedings.  That would be inconsistent with <em>Gladue</em>,
    which merely states that some consideration must be given to the distinct
    situation of Aboriginal peoples in Canada to avoid the further perpetuation of
    discrimination and disadvantage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I conclude that to the extent the
    Minister condoned the propriety of prosecutors exercising their discretion
    whether to lay charges on Canada or allow the prosecution to proceed elsewhere
    without regard to the </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> factors, he erred
    in law.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>REMEDY</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Section </span>57(6)(b)&nbsp;of the Act confers broad remedial
    powers on the court hearing an application for judicial review of a Ministerial
    surrender order. We can simply declare invalid or unlawful, quash, set aside
    the surrender decision, we can set aside and refer back to the Minister for
    determination in accordance with directions, or we can prohibit or restrain
    the decision of the Minister.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ministers surrender decision is discretionary and involves the exercise of
    political judgment. Where a surrender decision is set aside by the court on
    account of legal error, but where the courts decision leaves open the
    possibility of more than one reasonable disposition, it will be appropriate to
    remit the matter to the Minister for reconsideration in the light of the legal
    principles articulated by the court. The court should not usurp the Ministers
    political role by choosing among reasonable alternatives. For example, where it
    is conceivable that the Minister could articulate reasons for surrender
    consistent with the courts articulation of the applicable legal principles or
    take additional steps, such as seeking assurances from the extradition partner,
    that would make surrender consistent with the <em>Charter</em>,<em> </em>the
    matter should be remitted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, as provided by s. 57(6)(b) and as recognized in the case
    law, there are cases where it will be appropriate for a court to exercise a
    statutory power simply to set aside a discretionary decision, namely where
    remitting the case for reconsideration would be pointless because, in light
    of the circumstances and the evidence in the record, only one interpretation or
    solution is possible, that is, where any other interpretation or solution would
    be unreasonable: <em>Stetler v. The Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers'
    Marketing Board</em>, 2009 ONCA 234, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005]
    S.C.C.A. No. 428, at para. <span lang=FR-CA>42, citing <em>Giguère v. Chambre
    des notaires du Québec</em>, 2004 SCC 1, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. </span>66.
    For application of this principle in the context of extradition, see e.g. <em>Canada
    (Minister of Justice) v. Pacificador</em> (2002), 60 O.R.(3d) 685 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 390.</p>

    pertaining to Leonard are taken into account, it would be pointless to remit
    the matter to the Minister for reconsideration. I can see no possibility that
    the Minister could marshal reasons to support surrender on the basis that
    political considerations outweigh the devastating impact of the drastically
    different treatment to which Leonard would be subjected if surrendered. There
    has been no suggestion that the Minister could seek assurances that will reduce
    that disparity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> It would be contrary to the principles of
    fundamental justice to surrender this young Aboriginal first-offender to face a
    lengthy, crushing sentence in the United States that would almost certainly
    sever his ties to his family and Aboriginal culture and community with which he
    so closely identifies. Leonards personal history corresponds precisely with
    the factors identified in </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> and </span><em>Ipeelee</em><span
lang=EN-US> as requiring special consideration. It is clear that he will not
    get that consideration if surrendered to the United States and that he did not
    get it here from the Minister of Justice. His involvement in the alleged
    offence was, at worst, peripheral, and he has made substantial strides towards
    rehabilitation since his apprehension. I recognize that there is a considerable
    body of authority to the effect that extradition will not be refused simply
    because the person sought will receive a lengthier sentence in the foreign
    state: see, e.g. </span><em>United States of America v. J.H.K.</em><span
lang=EN-US> (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.). However, in this case, the
    sentence the applicant faces in the United States  about fifteen to nineteen
    years, as compared to a conditional or short custodial sentence in Canada  is
    so grossly disproportionate in light of the applicants personal circumstances
    that I conclude this is one of those exceptional cases where the shocks the
    conscience test outlined in </span><em>Burns</em><span lang=EN-US>, para. 69,
    quoted above at para 88, has been met. </span></p>

    matters to the Minister for reconsideration in accordance with the reasons of
    this court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like Sharpe
    J.A., I recognize that the decision to surrender a Canadian citizen to a
    foreign jurisdiction for trial is essentially a political decision.  The
    Minister is charged with the heavy responsibility of balancing competing
    interests and upholding Canadas international obligations under its treaties. 
    The failure to meet those obligations may have serious ramifications.  Courts
    are given limited authority to review the Ministers surrender orders. They are
    not, however, responsible for Canadas international obligations. The courts
    cannot, and should not, assume those responsibilities in the context of a
    judicial review application.  The surrender decision is for the Minister.  It
    must be a rare case where the court will take it upon itself to make that
    decision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these cases,
    the Minister was required to consider, apparently for the first time, the
    intersection of the <em>Gladue</em> principles with those principles governing
    the exercise of the Ministers jurisdiction to surrender under the <em>Extradition
    Act</em>.   The Minister took a certain view of that interaction, which this
    court has held was wrong in law.  The Minister exercised his discretion to
    order surrender based on a misapprehension of the relevance of the <em>Gladue</em> principles.  He should have an opportunity to exercise his discretion on a
    proper application of those principles.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A.
    opines that on a proper application of the <em>Gladue</em> principles surrender
    orders in both cases would inevitably violate s. 7. My colleagues analysis
    assumes that the record would be the same were the matters to be remitted to
    the Minister for reconsideration.  I do not think that assumption should be made.
    The Minister, with the benefit of my colleagues analysis of the interaction
    between the <em>Gladue</em> principles and the surrender power under the <em>Extradition
    Act</em>, might well require additional information about the backgrounds of
    Mr. Leonard and Mr. Gionet and their potential treatment in the American
    justice system were they to be surrendered for extradition.  Indeed, in light
    of my colleagues reasons, the authorities might well reconsider the merits of
    a prosecution in Canada. Were that to occur, the Minister might well decline
    surrender on that basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By remitting
    both matters to the Minister and giving him an opportunity to exercise his
    discretion in accordance with the principles set down in my colleagues
    reasons, we allow the parties to develop a full record responsive to the
    principles as articulated by Sharpe J.A.  Those principles emerge for the first
    time in this case.  More importantly, by remitting the matter to the Minister,
    the court ensures that the ultimate decision on the question of surrender
    remains with the entity responsible for the consequences of that decision.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If these matters
    are remitted to the Minister and the record before the Minister remains the
    same, my colleagues reasons make out a strong argument against surrender,
    particularly in Mr. Leonards case.  No doubt the Minister will appreciate the
    force of that argument.  If, however, new material is placed before the
    Minister, he will have an opportunity to address that material in light of the
    analysis of the impact of the <em>Gladue</em> principles on the surrender
    decision provided in my colleagues reasons.  In either case the Minister will
    make the decision and if necessary this court will review that decision in
    accordance with the applicable statutory provisions and the established jurisprudence.  </p>
