  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is now a quadriplegic. Following a very short trial by
    jury, he was convicted of five counts of sexual assault and sentenced to 30 months
    in the penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals both his conviction and the sentence imposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal against conviction, grant
    leave to appeal sentence, and allow the appeal against sentence.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was twelve or thirteen years old at the time of the
    incidents. At the time of all but the first incident, the appellant rented a
    basement apartment in the complainants familys home. The instances of sexual
    touching escalated in severity and ranged from touching the complainants
    breasts, vagina and buttocks, to cunnilingus and anal penetration.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that she told her mother about the first
    incident soon after it occurred, but did not tell her about the subsequent
    incidents. Her mother did not take the first incident seriously and the
    complainant thought her mother would not believe her if she reported any other
    incidents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> After the incidents at issue, the appellant was rendered a quadriplegic
    as a result of a serious motor vehicle accident. He was a passenger in a car
    driven by the complainants mother. The appellant launched a civil suit against
    the mother for some six million dollars. The claim exceeds the mothers
    insurance coverage, and the familys home is at risk. The complainant made her
    allegations against the appellant eight days after his claim against her mother
    was served.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The complainant and her mother were the only witnesses at trial. The
    complainant was fifteen years of age at the time of trial.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advances the following grounds of appeal of his conviction: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>1.       In his charge to the jury, the trial judge failed to:</p>

    complainant was a young witness did not affect the standard for analyzing her
    evidence; and</p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>specifically warn the jury of the dangers of convicting upon evidence
    given by parties with an animus against the appellant and instruct the jury on
    what evidence was capable of being confirmatory;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2.       The trial
    judge erred in allowing the videos and transcripts of the complainants
    testimony to be sent to the jury room; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3.       The verdict is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><em>Errors in the charge</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded that any of the four alleged deficiencies in the
    trial judges charge to the jury amounts to reversible error. While not
    determinative, we note that counsel for the appellant made no objection to the
    trial judges charge to the jury after the trial judge delivered it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the appellants first assertion, that the trial judge did not
    sufficiently relate the evidence to the issues in the case. As the trial judge
    noted, the real issue was whether the alleged incidents took place. In his
    closing argument to the jury, counsel for the appellant made the defences
    theory clear: the complainant and her mother were motivated to lie in an attempt
    to de-rail the civil lawsuit. The issue for the jury was not complex. The trial
    was brief. The evidence took less than a day and a half. It was fresh in the
    minds of the jurors.  In his closing argument to the jury, appellants counsel
    also reviewed what he argued were frailties in the complainants evidence that
    made her evidence not worthy of belief. While the trial judge might have
    related the evidence to the issues in a more detailed fashion, we are satisfied
    that in the circumstances, he sufficiently related the evidence to the issues
    before the jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants second assertion is that the trial judge did not adequately
    instruct the jury on the assessment of the complainants reliability. We
    disagree.  While the credibility, and not the reliability, of the complainant
    was the main issue, the trial judge also directed the jury to consider the
    witnesses character, their intellectual ability, their level of maturity, to
    keep in mind [the complainants] ability to observe and remember what
    happened and to consider the apparent memory capacity of the witness.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also disagree with the appellants third assertion, namely that the trial judge
    erred in his instructions regarding the standard for analyzing the evidence of
    a young witness. The complainant was 12 years old when she provided one of her
    videotaped statements to the police. The trial judge instructed the jury that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Young witnesses do not always have the same ability as adults
    to recall precise details or to describe events fully and accurately. For this
    reason, you may choose to regard some inconsistencies in their testimony as
    less significant than they would be if you had noticed them in the testimony of
    an adult. The important thing is to consider whether deficiencies of this sort
    mean that the young witness has misconceived the events she has described. In
    other words, you have to use your good common sense. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge carefully charged the jury that the Crown must prove the appellants
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge to the jury, the trial judge highlighted the complainants testimony
    that she did not like the appellant and wished that he would be sent to jail. He
    also reproduced the summary of the defences position provided to him by
    defence counsel, which included the defences position that the complainant had
    a motive to lie.  In the circumstances, this was sufficient.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span

    is, in our view, no merit to the appellants fourth argument, namely that the
    trial judge erred in failing to provide guidance to the jury on what, in law,
    can amount to corroborative or confirmatory evidence. The complainants
    evidence was that she told her mother about the first incident after it happened.
    In his charge, the trial judge explained:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>our law does not require corroboration of any complaint of
    this nature. It is up to you, the jury, to decide whether or not the evidence
    is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of
    an offence. It does not require anybody else to say yes.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, the mothers evidence perhaps depending on how
    you look at it, might provide some.  She told us about the disclosure. The
    mothers evidence it was a little confused on this, at least I found, she at
    first did not remember when the disclosure was made to her, and then seemed to
    remember that it was made the same night as they went to the play; at least that
    is my memory of it </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellants
    counsel concedes that confirmatory evidence is not required in cases of this
    nature.  The trial judge was not using corroboration in any technical sense. 
    His review of the mothers evidence was accurate and favoured the defence
    position.  Use of the term corroboration should be avoided, but in this case
    it caused no prejudice to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><em>The video and transcripts</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we agree that the trial judge erred in permitting the jury to view the
    videotape and transcripts of the complainants police interview inside the jury
    room during its deliberations. The trial judge has the discretion to permit the
    jury to do so. An appellate court will interfere with the trial judges
    exercise of discretion to allow the videotaped statement with them during deliberations
    only where the appellant can demonstrate that his right to a fair trial was
    compromised as a result: <em>R. v. Archer</em> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 (Ont.
    C.A.), para. 78. The appellant has not satisfied us that his right to a fair
    trial was compromised as a result of the trial judge permitting the jury to
    view the video and transcripts of the complainants statement to the police in
    the jury room.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><em>Unreasonable Verdict</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we are not persuaded that the verdict was unreasonable. The complainants
    evidence made out all of the elements of the offences with which the appellant
    was charged.  While there were frailties in that evidence, a properly
    instructed jury could convict on that evidence.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Sentence appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the sentence imposed on him is harsh and excessive having
    regard to his physical infirmity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge struggled to craft a fit sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant was 41 years of age at the time of sentencing. He was a first
    offender and had led an exemplary life. The trial judge noted that the
    appellant is in severe pain, has a colostomy, receives therapy four days a week
    and requires the daily assistance of a nurse to perform basic bodily functions.
    He needs a long list of some medications, including opiates, which must be
    taken several times daily.  He is at a high risk of developing complications. The
    trial judge concluded that a conditional sentence was not available, and, in
    the absence of information with respect to how the appellant might be treated
    while incarcerated, imposed a sentence of 30 months. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances of this case are extraordinary. On these totally unique facts,
    incarceration is not necessary to meet the objectives of sentencing and, having
    regard to the extent of the appellants physical infirmity, the sentence
    imposed is demonstrably unfit. Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted
    and we allow the sentence appeal and reduce the sentence to two years less a
    day, to be served in the community as a conditional sentence, on the terms,
    including house arrest, proposed by the Crown.</p>
