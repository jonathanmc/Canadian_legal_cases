  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered and the sentence
    imposed on September 12, 2011 by Justice Susan G. Himel of the Superior Court
    of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge>By the Court:</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pleaded guilty, with the assistance of counsel in a
    negotiated plea bargain, to five counts, including one count of sexual assault
    against an underage girl and one count of attempting to procure a second
    under-age girl to become a prostitute.  The girls were aspiring models; they
    believed that the appellant was a professional photographer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a joint submission, the appellant was sentenced on the five
    counts to five years and two months in prison and made subject to an order
    under s. 161 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> prohibiting him from attending near
    certain places where persons under 16 years of age may be present, in accordance
    with the joint submission.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this appeal, he challenges his conviction on the two specific counts
    described above.  He does not challenge the agreed statement of facts or seek
    to impugn the competence of his counsel at trial.  Rather, he argues that the
    agreed facts do not support the convictions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant indicated that he pled guilty to the count of
    sexual assault, and that he plead guilty to the count of attempting to procure
    the second complainant to become a prostitute if my actions constitute the
    elements of that offence.  Thereafter, the trial judge specifically inquired
    whether the appellant understood that a plea is an admission of the essential
    elements of the offence and understood the nature and consequences of pleading
    guilty.  He answered that he did.  On the basis of the agreed facts, and the
    agreement of counsel, the trial judge made findings of guilt on the two counts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also seeks leave to appeal his sentence, arguing that the
    sentence imposed was beyond the appropriate range.  He also argues that there
    is no evidence to support a finding that the appellant poses a risk of
    approaching young girls in public places and the s. 161 order accordingly
    should not have been imposed.  </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Sexual Assault Count</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We first address the count of sexual assault, to which the appellant
    plead guilty, without qualification.  The admitted facts are that the appellant
    had unprotected sexual intercourse with the first complainant periodically
    between July 2007 and early 2009.  From July 2007 until May 1, 2008 (the date
    the law changed to increase the age of consent to 16, from 14), the first
    complainant was 14 and 15 years old and therefore legally able to consent. 
    From May 1, 2008, until August 4, 2008, the first complainant was 15 years old
    and therefore, under the legal age of consent, namely 16.  From August 5, 2008,
    until early 2009, she was 16 and legally able to, and did, consent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the admitted periodic intercourse over
    nearly 18 months does not support a finding that intercourse occurred during
    the period between May 1, 2008, and August 4, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time the appellant entered his plea, he was represented by
    counsel and, as noted above, he does not raise an ineffective assistance of
    counsel ground on appeal.  There is accordingly a presumption that his plea was
    valid.  The appellant has not rebutted that presumption.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Liability for the offence charged was dependant on the appellant having
    sexual contact with the first complainant between May 1 and August 4, 2008.  The
    appellants guilty plea to this count was informed and unequivocal.  It is
    clearly implicit from the plea that a sexual encounter occurred during this
    3-month period.  Based on the admitted facts and the appellants response to
    her specific inquiry, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that intercourse
    occurred during the relevant period and find the appellant guilty of this
    count. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Procuring Count</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant took photos of the second complainant, including at his house, and a pattern
    of socializing developed, with the appellant providing vodka and food.  Sometimes
    the appellants friends joined them.  The second complainant was then 13 years
    of age.  An acquaintance of the appellant began supplying her with Oxycontin
    pills.  Sometime thereafter, the appellant told the second complainant that he
    would pay her $100 to have sex with him.  Over a period of 10 months, the
    second complainant would periodically go to the appellants house to have unprotected
    sex in exchange for money.  The appellant told the second complainant that she
    was his special girl and he did not want her to date anyone else.  In spite
    of this, the appellant suggested to the second complainant at one point that if
    she wanted extra money, she could go and see his friends and they would pay her
    for sex.  Her answer was always no.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant portion of s. 212(1)(d) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> provides that
    everyone who procures or attempts to procure a person to become a prostitute is
    guilty of an indictable offence.  The appellant argues: (1) that his offer of
    an opportunity to the second complainant to make money by having sex with his
    friends did not amount to an attempt to procure; and (2) that the section
    only targets those who were not already having sex for money to become
    prostitutes, and there was no basis on the agreed facts for the trial judge to
    find that the second complainant was not already a prostitute when she met the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the agreed statement of facts and the guilty plea, it was open to the trial
    judge to find that the appellants offer to pay the second complainant for sex
    (which was accepted) amounted to procuring or that his subsequent offer that
    his friends would pay her for sex amounted to an attempt to procure.  The
    appellants plea was an admission to all the elements of the offence 
    including that the second complainant was not a prostitute.  Moreover, the
    agreed facts clearly depict the second complainant as being groomed for sex,
    which is inconsistent with her having been a prostitute at the time she met the
    appellant.  We note that earlier in the relationship, she refused to perform a
    lap dance for the appellant.  Having made an informed plea, the appellant seeks
    to take advantage of imprecision in the wording of the agreed facts.  He has
    not rebutted the presumption that his plea was valid.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Sentence</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court stated in <em>R. v. Murray</em>, 2007 ONCA 799, at para. 7:  This
    court will not lightly interfere with a sentence imposed based [on] the
    acceptance of a joint submission.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentence imposed was within the appropriate range and we see no basis for
    interfering.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    s. 161 order was, in our view, a part of the joint submission and, indeed, was warranted. 
    With the Crowns consent, we are persuaded that the clarification sought by the
    appellant  namely that the words and other locations should not be part of
    the order  is appropriate.  A new s. 161 order, with that change shall
    accordingly issue.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Disposition</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed, leave to appeal
    sentence is granted, and the appeal against sentence is dismissed. </p>
