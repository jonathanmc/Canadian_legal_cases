    (entitlement to deferred pension) dies before commencement of payment of the
    deferred pension, the person who is the spouse of the member or former member

  <p class=CQuote>Designated beneficiary</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(6) A member or former member of a pension plan may designate a

    number of factual disputes between the parties. Mrs. Carrigan argued that she
    and Mr. Carrigan never separated, leading evidence of his frequent presence at
    the family home and his continued participation in family events. In the
    alternative she contested the date of separation advocated by Ms. Quinn. The
    trial judge had to resolve these factual issues because Mrs. Carrigan’s primary
    position at trial was that she was entitled to Mr. Carrigan’s death benefit as
    his “spouse” under s. 48(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN

    Carrigan’s death the statutory definition of “spouse” applied to both Mrs.
    Carrigan and Ms. Quinn. She reasoned that Mrs. Carrigan is a “spouse” because
    she was legally married to Mr. Carrigan, and that Ms. Quinn is a “spouse”
    because she was living with Mr. Carrigan in a conjugal relationship and she had
    done so continuously for more than three years prior to his death. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge noted that s. 48(1) refers to “the
    spouse” and concluded there could only be one spouse entitled to a member’s
    death benefit. Therefore the benefit could not be split between the two women
    who both qualified as a spouse of Mr. Carrigan. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge resolved the conundrum this
    presented by focusing on s. 48(3) of the </span><em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>PBA</span></em><span lang=EN>. She
    understood s. 48(3) to require that a spouse be living with the member in order
    to be entitled to the death benefit. She found as a fact that Mr. and Mrs.
    Carrigan were living separate and apart at the time of death and that therefore
    Mrs. Carrigan was not eligible to receive the death benefit. The trial judge
    went on to hold that Ms. Quinn was entitled to receive the death benefit because
    she was a spouse and was living with Mr. Carrigan at his death.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge rejected the other argument made by
    counsel for Mrs. Carrigan, namely, that Mr. Carrigan’s designation of Mrs.
    Carrigan and their two daughters as the pension beneficiaries should mean that
    Mrs. Carrigan and her daughters were entitled to receive the benefit under s.
    48(6). The trial judge read s. 48(6) to apply only when there is “no eligible
    spouse”, and since Ms. Quinn counts as a spouse in this circumstance, the
    designation under s. 48(6) is irrelevant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge reasoned, at para. 52:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The member who dies before being entitled to payment of his pension
    can only have one spouse on the day he died, “the spouse,” and the entitlement
    to receive the death benefit as a spouse can only be reasonably interpreted to
    be the person who meets one of the requirements in the s. 1 definition of
    spouse as well as the requirement found in s. 48(3) that the spouse and the
    member cannot be living separate and apart on the day of the member's death.
    There is, therefore, only one person who meets the requirements of both s. 1
    and s. 48 of the <em>Pension Benefits Act</em> as well as the definition of “spouse”
    in the pension plan itself: that is Ms. Quinn.</p>

    or constructive trust or unjust enrichment theory. </span></p>

    interpretation that begins with the statutory definition of “spouse”. The
    definition opens by stating that a “spouse” is “either of two persons” who are
    married to each other, or who are not married to each other but satisfy other
    criteria. The two persons referred to are the pension member and the person
    with whom the member is in a spousal relationship. The word “either” in the
    definition should not be misread to refer to a legally married spouse on the
    one hand and a common law spouse on the other. The PBA definition of spouse is
    unlike the definition of spouse in s. 29 of Part III of the Family Law Act,
    R.S.O. 1990, C. F.3 , which includes a common law spouse “in addition” to a
    spouse as defined in s. 1(1) of the Family Law Act. </span></p>

    that if a member has a legally married spouse, he or she cannot have a common
    law spouse. According to the definition, “spouse” means either of “two
    persons”. Since one of the “two persons” is the pension member, only one other
    person can be a member’s spouse. Once two persons satisfy paragraph (a) of the
    definition because they are legally married to each other, there is no need to
    consider whether the two persons can qualify as spouses without being married. The
    appellant reads the definition to say that “spouse” means either of two persons
    who are married to each other, or </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%'>if not legally married </span></em><span lang=EN>are
    living together in a conjugal relationship. Reading the definition in this way,
    the appellant argues that only Mrs. Carrigan qualifies as a “spouse” for the
    purposes of the </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:

    spouse under the </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:

13.0pt;line-height:200%'>PBA</span></em><span lang=EN> multiple persons can
    qualify as the member’s spouse, and a legally married spouse does not take
    precedence over a common law spouse. In this case, both Mrs. Carrigan and Ms.
    Quinn qualify as a spouse of Mr. Carrigan. Under this interpretation, the
    respondent argues that the </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:200%'>PBA </span></em><span lang=EN>would award the death benefit
    to whichever spouse was cohabitating with the pension member at death. The
    respondent submits that s. 48(3) makes this clear, disentitling a spouse living
    separate and apart from the member on the date of the member’s death from taking
    the death benefit. </span></p>

    definition pose difficulties. On one hand, if both Mrs. Carrigan and Ms. Quinn
    are considered to be Mr. Carrigan’s spouses, there would be three spouses
    (including Mr. Carrigan) and the definition stipulates that a spouse is “either
    of two persons”. On the other hand, the statutory definition does not indicate
    that the legal relationship described in paragraph (a) takes priority over the
    common law relationship described in paragraph (b).</span></p>

    what happens when the member or former member of a pension plan dies before
    commencement of payment of a deferred pension. The purpose of s. 48 is to require
    that a benefit at least equal to the commuted value of the deferred pension be
    paid to the member’s spouse, to the member’s designated beneficiary, or to the
    member’s estate representative. </span></p>

    designated a beneficiary as envisaged by s. 48(6) or dies intestate as
    envisaged by s. 48(7). Given the assumption that both Mrs. Carrigan and Ms.
    Quinn are spouses, we encounter difficulty in applying s. 48(1): while the
    statutory priority is in favour of “the spouse of the member”, here the member
    has two spouses. </span></p>

    the statutory provision being interpreted be considered in the context of the
    statute as a whole. Considering s. 48(1) in context, it is readily apparent
    that it does not apply in all circumstances. Section 48(3) defines a situation
    in which s. 48(1) does not apply. It states that “[s]ubsection (1) … [does] not
    apply where the member or former member and his or her spouse are living
    separate and apart on the date of the death of the member or former member.” In
    other words, when the member and his or her spouse are living separate and
    apart when the member dies, s. 48(1) does not apply, and therefore there is no
    statutory direction that the death benefit be paid to the member’s spouse. </span></p>

    “requirement” that “the spouse and the member cannot be living separate and
    apart on the day of the member’s death” in order for a spouse to receive the
    death benefit. She made much of the fact that Ms. Quinn was living with Mr.
    Carrigan at the date of his death. Thus, she was convinced that Ms. Quinn
    satisfied s. 48(3)’s “requirement”. However, on its face, s. 48(3) does not
    impose a requirement; rather, it sets out a circumstance that makes s. 48(1)
    inapplicable. The trial judge erred by applying s. 48(1) when the circumstance
    contemplated by s. 48(3) existed.</span></p>

    enough that Mrs. Carrigan satisfies the circumstance in s. 48(3). Mrs. Carrigan

    still be a “spouse” under the </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;

    of the statutory definition applies to two persons not legally married who “are
    living in a conjugal relationship”. The circumstance contemplated by s. 48(3) –
    that the member and his or her spouse are living separate and apart on the date

    person” is employed in a particular provision of the statute, that particular
    provision could only refer to a “woman” even though “person” could mean either
    a man or a woman in other provisions. The particular provision would have to be
    interpreted and applied to mean a “woman”. In the same way, the term “spouse living
    separate and apart from the member” must necessarily connote the legally
    married spouse of the member. In the context of the </span><em><span lang=EN

    “spouse” encompasses both Mrs. Carrigan and Ms. Quinn, only Ms. Carrigan could
    be the “spouse” referred to in s. 48(3). Since the circumstance contemplated by
    s. 48(3) exists, s. 48(1) is rendered inapplicable. Since s. 48(1) is
    inapplicable, the difficulty in applying the spousal priority falls away. When
    s. 48(1) does not apply, there is no provision that the “spouse” of the member
    is entitled to the death benefit. As there is no spousal entitlement, the
    member’s designated beneficiary is entitled to the death benefit under s. 48(6)

    Either, the member does not have a spouse on the date of death; or, the member
    is living separate and apart from his or her spouse on that day. The structure
    of s. 48(6) indicates that the existence of either circumstance triggers the
    application of the subsection. The same reasoning employed in regard to s.
    48(3) applies to the second circumstance in s. 48(6). Mr. and Mrs. Carrigan
    were living separate and apart on the date of his death. The second
    circumstance in s. 48(6) exists and the application of the section is

    certain aspects of his analysis and his final conclusion.  In particular, I
    disagree with my colleague that Mrs. Carrigan, because she is a married spouse,
    triggers the application of s. 48(3) such that Ms. Quinn is denied a death
    benefit under s. 48(1) and the benefit goes to Mrs. Carrigan and her two

    put forward by Mrs. Carrigan at para. 52 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The wording of the s. 1 definition of “spouse” captures both
    Mrs. Carrigan and Ms. Quinn.  Section 48(1) and (3) are clear and unambiguous
    in their language.  The member who dies before being entitled to payment of his
    pension can only have one spouse on the day he died, “the spouse,” and the
    entitlement to receive the death benefit as a spouse can only be reasonably
    interpreted to be the person who meets one of the requirements in the s. 1
    definition of spouse as well as the requirement found in s. 48(3) that the
    spouse and the member cannot be living separate and apart on the day of the
    member’s death.  There is, therefore, only one person who meets the
    requirements of both s. 1 and s. 48 of the <em>Pension Benefits Act</em> as
    well as the definition of “spouse” in the pension plan itself: that is Ms.
    Quinn. </p>

lang=EN>This definition is important for purposes of the PBA because spouses of

lang=EN>Second, my colleague takes issue with the trial judge’s comment that s.
    48(3) imposes a “requirement” that “the spouse and the member cannot be living
    separate and apart on the day of the member’s death” in order for a spouse to
    receive the death benefit.  In my colleague’s view, s. 48(3) sets out a
    circumstance - not a requirement - that makes s. 48(1) inapplicable, and so the
    trial judge was in error.</span></p>

    “imposing a requirement” or “it sets a circumstance that makes s. 48(1)
    inapplicable”, it amounts to the same thing.  In my respectful view, nothing
    turns on the distinction.  For a spouse to be entitled to receive a benefit
    under s. 48(1), he or she cannot be living separate and apart from the member
    on the date of death.  In this case, Mrs. Carrigan was while Ms. Quinn was

    other words, while married and common law spouses may, in other legal contexts,
    continue to have certain legal rights even if they are living separate and

    remedies, is subordinate to this legislation.  By enacting an exhaustive set of
    rules dealing with pensions, the legislature has occupied the field and
    precluded recourse to the common law as argued by Mrs. Carrigan.</span></p>

lang=EN>In my view, the result in this case is dictated by a proper
    interpretation of s. 48 of the PBA and the s. 1 definition of spouse.  However,
    as an aside, I would note that the trial judge’s reasoning and decision in this
    case do not produce an inequitable result for Mrs. Carrigan.  The PBA provides
    a detailed scheme for handling the claims of divorced or separated spouses, and
    s. 48(13) allows for the subordination of the usual system for distributing a
    death benefit under s. 48 to </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;

    Carrigan for a number of years and while living with Ms. Quinn in what was
    clearly a long-term relationship, made a designation under s. 48(6) of the <i>PBA</i> concerning his pension benefits.   The effect of this designation was that in
    the event of his death before payment of his deferred pension commenced and he
    did not have a spouse or was living separate and apart from his spouse, the
    designated individuals became beneficiaries entitled to be paid an amount equal
    to the commuted value of his deferred pension. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Section 1 of the Act recognizes both categories of relationships
    in which Mr. Carrigan was involved at the time of his death - Mrs. Carrigan,
    his legally married spouse and Ms. Quinn, his common law spouse - as spousal
    relationships. The Act therefore contemplates a situation, such as the one in
    which Mr. Carrigan found himself, where an individual can have two spouses
    simultaneously.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>My colleague LaForme J.A. is of the view that since
    s. 1 of the <i>PBA</i> allows for two spousal relationships to exist at the
    same time, s. 48 of the Act should be interpreted as being capable of applying
    to two co-existing spousal relationships. My colleague Juriansz J.A. is also
    prepared to accept such a possibility. I respectfully disagree. I am of the
    view that the wording of s. 1 and the wording and structure of s. 48 of the <i>PBA</i> make it clear that the legislation can only be interpreted as applying to one
    spousal relationship at any point in time.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In terms of the plain language of the <i>PBA</i>, I
    start, as did Juriansz J.A., with the definition of spouse.  As my colleague
    points out in para. 20 above, s.1 defines “spouse” as being “either of two
    persons”, not three, and as belonging to one category – legally married <u>or</u> common law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>This wording leads me to the following conclusion. 
    While the Act recognizes two categories of spouse, the scheme in s. 48, which
    determines the recipient of the pre-retirement death benefit,<i> </i>is
    expressly designed to apply to the situation where the member of the pension
    plan has only one spouse at a time.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The language used throughout s. 48 reinforces this
    conclusion.  I point specifically to the wording found in ss. 48(1)-(4), (6),
    and (14), each of which is written in contemplation of only one spouse.  For
    example, s. 48(1) refers to “<u>the</u> person who is <u>his or her spouse</u>”,
    phraseology repeated or only slightly varied in the other provisions. [emphasis
    added]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN

    there is no debate over the fact that the scheme creates a spousal priority, a
    priority that is lost if, at the time of death, the pension member has no
    spouse or lives separate and apart from his or her spouse.  In that event, s.
    48(6) is engaged and the pension benefits go to the person or persons in whose
    favour a designation has been made, failing which the benefits become the
    property of the pension holder’s estate under s. 48(7).  Notably, under ss.
    48(6)(b) and 48(7)(b), the entitlement of the designated beneficiaries or the
    estate to the pension benefits depends on the pension member’s not having a
    spouse or living separate and apart from his or her spouse at the time of death..  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As observed by Juriansz J.A., the problem is that
    it is not possible to read s. 48(3) as applying to a common law spouse, as, if
    the member of the pension plan is living separate and apart from an individual
    with whom he is not married, that individual is not a “spouse” under s. 1 of
    the <i>PBA.</i>  Obviously, the same observation must be made in relation to
    ss. 48(6)(b) and (7)(b).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The subsections dealing with the circumstances
    under which a designation may be effective or under which the benefits may go
    to the member’s estate cannot be ignored.  Once a finding is made, as it was by
    the motion judge, that at the time of death Mr. Carrigan was living separate
    and apart from Mrs. Carrigan, his legally married spouse, then s. 48(3) triggers
    the beneficiary designation under s. 48(6) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Based on this analysis, I agree with Juriansz J.A.
    that s. 48 must be interpreted to mean that if, at the time of death, the
    pension benefit holder had a legally married spouse from whom he or she was
    living separate and apart, a designation that had been made under s. 48(6)
    would apply regardless of the fact that he was living with a person who fell
    within one of the two definitions of spouse.</span></p>

    position.  He was married to Mrs. Carrigan and he was living separate and apart
    from her.  This engages s. 48(3), which in turn eliminates the application of
    the spousal priority set out in s. 48(1) and allows for the application of s.
    48(6).  The result is that Mrs. Carrigan and the Carrigans’ two daughters, as
    designated beneficiaries under s. 48(6) of the <i>PBA</i>, are entitled to the
    pension benefit. </span></p>
