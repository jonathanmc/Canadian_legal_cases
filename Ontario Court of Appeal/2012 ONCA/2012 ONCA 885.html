  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Colin D.A.
    McKinnon of the Superior Court of Justice, dated December 7, 2011, with reasons
    reported at 2011 ONSC 7076.</p>
  <p class=Heading><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Simmons
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue in this appeal is whether an unregistered equitable
    interest can take priority over a lien registered by the Canada Revenue Agency
    against a taxpayer’s real property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alexander Tran owes the CRA approximately $1.6 million in unpaid income
    taxes and GST. In 2005 and 2007, the CRA registered liens for the amounts owing
    against the title to three Ontario properties which Mr. Tran owns, or co-owns
    with his wife.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Tran was convicted of income tax evasion in 2009. Following his
    conviction, his sister, Rosaline Trang, and his wife, Carolyn Nguyen, each
    brought a lawsuit against Mr. Tran seeking a declaration that they held an
    unregistered equitable interest in one or more of his properties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Trang claims she has equitable mortgages over all her brother's
    lands. Ms. Nguyen claims she is entitled to a 50% share of a business property
    registered in Mr. Tran's name alone based on work she did in the business.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On consent, the CRA was added as a party to Ms. Nguyen’s family law
    proceeding, which was transferred to the Ontario Superior Court to be heard
    together with Ms. Trang’s civil claim. The CRA then brought a motion under rule
    21.01(1)(a) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>,<em> </em>R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194, to determine whether the equitable interests claimed by Ms. Trang and
    Ms. Nguyen could, if proven, entitle them to payment in priority to the CRA's
    registered liens. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion proceeded based on an Agreed Statement of Facts. It was also
    assumed for the purposes of the motion that Ms. Trang and Ms. Nguyen would
    succeed in obtaining declarations of their equitable interests in Mr. Tran's
    properties as of a date prior to the date of registration of the CRA liens and
    that the CRA had no notice of the prior unregistered claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the motion, McKinnon J. held that the unregistered equitable
    interests of Mr. Tran’s wife and sister could be payable in priority to the
    CRA's subsequent liens.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the motion judge rejected the CRA's
    submission that s. 223(5)(a) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1
    (5th Supp.)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a><em> </em>makes the CRA liens the effective equivalent of a “charge” under s. 93 of
    the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5, thus giving them priority
    over pre-existing unregistered interests. Instead, the motion judge found that
    s. 223(5)(a) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> gives the CRA the same status as
    that of a judgment creditor. That status does not override valid prior
    unregistered equitable interests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the CRA does not take issue with the motion judge's
    conclusion concerning the effect of s. 223(5)(a) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>.
    Rather, the CRA submits that the motion judge erred by failing to consider s.
    223(5)(b) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CRA
    submits that s. 223(5)(b) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> adopts the scheme of
    priority created for collection of amounts owing to the provincial Crown. The
    CRA says that, under the Ontario scheme, once a notice of indebtedness to the
    Crown is registered, it secures a “lien and charge” on a debtor's lands. By its
    terms, s. 93 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> gives the “charge” priority over
    any unregistered interests in the land. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CRA
    acknowledges that it did not bring s. 223(5)(b) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> to the motion judge's attention. However, the CRA contends that because the
    interpretation of s. 223(5)(b) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> involves a
    question of law alone, this court is not precluded from determining its effect
    on appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any
    event, the CRA argues that, under the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, its interest in
    Mr. Tran's properties is not subject to a constructive trust claim by his
    spouse. Further, the CRA contends that the motion judge erred in his findings
    of fact relating to the nature of Ms. Trang's interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the
    reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Properties</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the Agreed Statement of Facts, Mr. Tran has an interest in three properties
    that were relevant to the CRA's motion:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>58 Granton Avenue, Ottawa – a residential property registered in
    the names of Mr. Tran and his wife, Ms. Nguyen, as joint tenants and used by
    them as their principal residence;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>46 Epworth Avenue, Ottawa – registered in the names of Mr. Tran
    and Ms. Nguyen as joint tenants and used by them as an investment property;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>1340 Wellington Street West, Ottawa – Mr. Tran’s business
    property, registered in his name alone and used for his acupuncture practice.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CRA Liens</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005,
    in accordance with the procedure set out in the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, the
    Minister of National Revenue certified Mr. Tran's GST debt as owing and then
    registered the certificate in the Federal Court. As provided for by the
    legislation, the CRA proceeded to register a lien for the amount owing against
    the title to each of the three properties in which Mr. Tran has an interest. In
    2007, the CRA followed a similar procedure with respect to Mr. Tran's income
    tax debt, this time relying on the provisions of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    documents registered on title by the CRA are entitled “LRO # 4 Lien”. The body
    of the document registered under ss. 223(5) and (6) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> includes the following statements:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>WHEREAS <em>pursuant to subsection[s] 223 (5) and (6) of the
    Income Tax Act, a document</em> which the Court has issued, and <em>which
    evidences a certificate of that Court</em> <em>upon registration on title</em> or otherwise recorded <em>creates a charge, lien or priority on, or a binding
    interest in property that the tax debtor holds</em>;</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Now therefore take notice that her Majesty the Queen in right
    of Canada as represented by the Minister of National Revenue <em>claims a lien
    and charge </em>against the interest of Alexander Tran… in the lands described
    in this notice.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Such lien charges have priority over all encumbrances or
    claims registered or attaching to the subject property subsequent to the
    registration of this notice</em>. [Emphasis added.]<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Lawsuits Brought by Ms. Nguyen and Ms. Trang</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April
    2009, Ms. Nguyen commenced a family law application against Mr. Tran claiming a
    declaration that she is entitled to: i) a 50% interest in the Wellington Street
    property by way of resulting or constructive trust; and ii) priority over the
    CRA's liens. This claim arises from work and services allegedly performed by
    Ms. Nguyen in her husband’s acupuncture clinic between 1991 and 2002.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few
    weeks later, in May 2009, Ms. Trang commenced an application against Mr. Tran, Ms.
    Nguyen and the CRA in which she claimed, among other things: i) an equitable
    mortgage in the amount of $250,000 against the Granton Avenue and Epworth
    Avenue properties arising from an agreement signed in December 2003; and ii) a
    declaration that her equitable mortgage ranks in priority to the CRA liens. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Trang's application was later converted to an action. In her statement of
    claim, Ms. Trang claimed an additional mortgage in the amount of $100,000
    against the Epworth Avenue and Wellington Street properties and priority over
    the CRA liens.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August
    and September 2010, Ms. Trang and Ms. Nguyen registered certificates of pending
    litigation against the properties in which they claimed an interest. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August
    2011, an order was made on consent adding the CRA to Ms. Nguyen’s family law
    application and directing that it be heard together with Ms. Trang's action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October
    2011, the CRA brought its Rule 21 motion seeking determination of the following
    question:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Can the plaintiffs’ unregistered equitable interest in certain
    properties be payable in priority to the Crown’s subsequent legal interest in
    those properties, where the Crown’s interest was registered in the Land
    Registry Office without notice of the plaintiff’s alleged equitable interest?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the answer
    to the question was “no”, the CRA requested an order striking out those parts
    of the claims asserting the priority of Ms. Nguyen’s and Ms. Trang’s
    unregistered equitable interests over the CRA’s registered legal interest in
    those properties. It also sought an order discharging the certificates of
    pending litigation to facilitate the sale of the properties.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion judge’s decision</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion
    judge held, at para. 9, that the answer to the question posed by the CRA turned
    on whether or not the liens it registered against Mr. Tran’s properties could
    properly be considered “charges” under the <em>Land Titles Act.</em> For
    several reasons, he concluded that they could not. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, at
    para. 10, the motion judge observed that the “land title registers themselves”
    that were filed in evidence referred to the CRA’s claims as “liens”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, at
    paras. 11-14, the motion judge referred to those portions of the <em>Income Tax
    Act</em> which provide that, when the CRA files a document evidencing a debt,
    that document has the same effect as a judgment of a court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, at
    para. 15, the motion judge noted that s. 223(11.1) of the <em>Income Tax Act </em>provides
    that where the debtor is bankrupt, the lien is deemed to be “a claim that is
    secured by a security” and ranks as a secured claim under the <em>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3. Here, there was no bankruptcy
    that would serve to elevate the CRA’s claims to that of a secured creditor. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, at
    paras. 18-21, the motion judge considered the wording of s. 93 of the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em>, which provides, in part, that “a registered owner may … charge
    the land” (s. 93(1)), and that a registered charge is a “security upon the land
    thereby charged to the extent of the money or money’s worth actually advanced
    or supplied under the charge” (s. 93(4)). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion
    judge concluded that the wording of these sections is unambiguous: only a
    registered owner can create a “charge” under the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, and
    a charge stands as security only for the money or money’s worth actually
    advanced under the charge. Since the CRA is not a registered owner and did not
    advance money or money’s worth to secure its debt, it did not hold a “charge”
    within the meaning of this section. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, at
    para. 22, the motion judge held that because the CRA does not hold a “charge”
    within the meaning of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> and because it had neither
    advanced consideration for its interest nor acquired title, the question of
    whether or not it had notice of the equitable claims was irrelevant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the motion judge referred to case law, including from this court, to the effect
    that equitable doctrines and jurisdiction apply to property under the land
    titles regime: see for example <em>Mutual Trust Co. v. Creditview Estate Homes
    Ltd.</em> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 583 (C.A.).</p>

    the taxpayer. This document is called “a memorial” (s. 223(5)).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    convenience, I will set out ss. 223(5), (6) and (11.1) of the <em>Income Tax
    Act</em> and include all other relevant provisions of both Acts in an Appendix.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    223(5) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> permits the CRA to register a document
    against the title to real property owned by the taxpayer. This document, called
    a memorial, is issued by the Federal Court and evidences a s. 223(2)
    certificate registered with the Court. Sections 223(5)(a) and (b) and  223(6)
    are central to the issues on appeal. They describe the effect of registering a
    memorial on title. I will therefore set them out in full here:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>223(5) A document issued by the Federal Court
    evidencing a certificate in respect of the debtor registered under subsection
    223 (3), a writ of that Court issued pursuant to the certificate or any notification
    of the document or writ (such document, writ or notification in this section
    referred to as a “memorial”) may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded for
    the purpose of creating a charge, lien or priority on, or a binding interest
    in, property in a province, or any interest in such property, held by the
    debtor in the same manner as a document evidencing</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a)     a judgment of the Superior Court of the
    province against a person for debt owing by the person, or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b)     an amount payable or required to be
    remitted by a person in the province in respect of a debt owing to Her Majesty
    in right of the province</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded in
    accordance with or pursuant to the law of the province to create a charge, lien
    or priority on, or a binding interest in, the property or interest.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>223(6) If a memorial has been filed, registered or
    otherwise recorded under subsection 223(5),</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a)     a charge, lien or priority is created on,
    or a binding interest is created in, property in the province, or any interest
    in such property, held by the debtor, or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b)     such property or interest in the property
    is otherwise bound,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
    memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph 223 (5)
    (a) or an amount referred to in paragraph 223 (5)(b), and the charge, lien,
    priority or binding interest created shall be subordinate to any charge, lien,
    priority or binding interest in respect of which all steps necessary to make it
    effective against other creditors were taken before the time the memorial was
    filed, registered or otherwise recorded.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    223 (11.1) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> is also important. It describes
    circumstances in which a charge, lien, priority or binding interest created
    under subsection 223(6) is deemed to be a secured claim. Section 223 (11.1)
    provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(11.1) When a charge, lien, priority or binding interest
    created under subsection 223(6) by filing, registering or otherwise recording a
    memorial under subsection 223(5) is registered in accordance with subsection
    87(1) of the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, it is deemed</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a)     to be a claim that is secured by a
    security and that, subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a secured
    claim under that Act; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b)     to also be a claim referred to in
    paragraph 86(2)(a) of that Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 93
    of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> is also important to the issues on appeal
    because s. 93(3) stipulates that the interest created by a “charge” is free
    from any unregistered interests in the charged lands. Section 93 of the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em> provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>93(1) A registered owner may in the prescribed manner
    charge the land with the payment at an appointed time of any principal sum of
    money either with or without interest or as security for any other purpose and
    with or without a power of sale.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2)     A charge that secures the payment of money
    shall state the amount of the principal sum that it secures.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3)     The charge, when registered, confers upon the
    chargee a charge upon the interest of the chargor as appearing in the register
    subject to the encumbrances and qualifications to which the chargor's interest
    is subject, <em>but free from any unregistered interest in the land</em>.

  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Position of the appellant</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have
    explained above, before the motion judge, the CRA relied on s. 223(5)(a) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> to argue that, once registered against the title to
    land under the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, a memorial creates a “charge” on land
    within the meaning of s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act, </em>such that the
    memorial has priority over unregistered equitable interests. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal,
    the CRA relies on ss. 223(5)(b) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> to make the same
    argument. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    223(5)(b) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> permits a memorial to be registered to
    create “a charge, lien or priority on” property of a taxpayer “in the same
    manner as a document evidencing” a debt owing to the provincial Crown. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    223(6) provides that if a memorial has been registered under s. 223(5), “a
    charge, lien or priority is created” against the taxpayer's property “in the
    same manner … as if the memorial were a document evidencing” a debt to the
    provincial Crown. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CRA
    points to various Ontario statutes which provide that registration of a notice
    of an amount owing to the provincial Crown against the title to real property
    creates a “lien and charge” on the real property. The CRA contends that these
    statutes have the effect of creating a “charge” against the real property
    within the meaning of s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> in favour of the
    provincial Crown. In turn, s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act </em>stipulates
    that a “charge” has priority over unregistered interests. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, the CRA relies on s. 17.1 of the <em>Fuel Tax Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. F.35, as an example of how the Ontario scheme for collection of amounts
    owing to the province operates in relation to real property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CRA
    claims that s. 17.1(3) creates a “lien and charge” against real property and
    that use of the language “lien and charge” signals the Legislature’s intent to
    create a “charge” within the meaning of s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>.
    The relevant portions of s. 17.1 of the <em>Fuel Tax Act</em> are as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>17.1 (1) <em>Any tax payable</em> or required to be remitted
    under this Act by any taxpayer <em>is, upon registration</em> by the Minister <em>in
    the proper land registry office of a notice claiming a lien and charge</em> conferred by this section, <em>a lien and charge</em> on any interest the
    taxpayer liable to pay or remit the tax has in the real property described in
    the notice.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)   [Lien on personal property]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)   <em>The lien and charge conferred by subsection (1)</em> or (2) is in respect of all amounts for which the taxpayer is liable under this
    Act at the time of registration of the notice or any renewal of it and all
    amounts for which the taxpayer afterwards becomes liable while the notice
    remains registered and, upon registration of a notice of lien and charge, the
    lien and charge <em>has priority over</em>,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a)   any perfected security interest registered after the
    notice is registered;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b)   any security interest perfected by possession after the
    notice is registered; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c)   <em>any encumbrance or other claim that is registered
    against or that otherwise arises and affects the taxpayer's property after the
    notice is registered</em>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CRA
    notes that the mechanism of using a “lien and charge” to secure amounts owing
    to the province was introduced into a number of Ontario taxation statutes in
    1994 under <em>An Act to Amend Various Taxation Statutes Administered by the
    Minister of Finance and to Amend the Liquor Licence Act</em>, S.O. 1994, c. 18
    – Schedule “B”.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a><em> </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    “charge” is not defined in the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, the CRA argues that s.
    2 of the <em>Land Registration Reform Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.4<em> </em>defines
    “charge” so as to include the interest in land created by ss. 223(5)(b) and
    223(6) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. The definition of charge as it appears
    in s. 2 of the <em>Land Registration Reform Act</em> states:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>“charge” means a charge on land given for the purpose of
    securing the payment of a debt or the performance of an obligation, and
    includes a charge under the Land Titles Act and a mortgage, but does not
    include a rent charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the CRA argues that the combined effect of ss. 223(5)(b) and 223(6) of the <em>Income
    Tax Act</em>, s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, s. 2 of the <em>Land
    Registration Reform Act</em> and the provisions of the various debt enforcement
    provisions of Ontario taxing statutes is that registration of a memorial
    evidencing an income tax debt in a Land Titles Office gives the memorial
    priority over prior unregistered equitable interests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support
    of its argument, the CRA also relies on <em>Canada (Attorney General) v. Keith
    G. Collins Ltd.</em>, 2008 MBQB 64, 226 Man. R. (2d) 290, aff’d 2008 MBCA 92,
    228 Man. R. (2d) 266. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the CRA, the debt enforcement mechanism for debts owing to the provincial
    Crown varies from province to province. While some provinces provide that
    registration of a notice of indebtedness to the provincial Crown is the
    equivalent of a money judgment only (“type 1 provinces”), the CRA maintains
    that other provinces provide for the creation of a “lien and charge” upon the
    registration of a notice of indebtedness to the provincial Crown (“type 2
    provinces”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, for
    example, in <em>Investors Group Trust Co. Ltd. v. Eckhoff</em>, 2008 SKCA 18,
    307 Sask. R. 164, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal noted that debts owing to
    the provincial Crown are enforceable only as if they were money judgments. The
    CRA contends that Saskatchewan is therefore a type 1 province.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    contrast, the CRA maintains that the effect of the<em> Keith G. Collins Ltd.</em> decision is that Manitoba is a type 2 province. According to the CRA, this
    means that, upon registration of a notice of indebtedness to the provincial
    Crown, the provincial Crown acquires a security interest in all of the debtor's
    property. The CRA maintains that in Ontario, the effect is the same. The fact
    that provincial legislation specifies that the provincial Crown is entitled to
    a lien and charge on a debtor's property means that, in the case of real
    property, the provincial Crown acquires a “charge” within the meaning of s.
    93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, thus giving it priority over prior
    unregistered equitable interests. As the <em>Income Tax Act</em> adopts the
    provincial scheme for enforcement of debts owing to the province, the CRA is
    entitled to the same priority. </p>
  <h1>F.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Discussion</h1>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='

    223(5)(b), when the issue was not raised in the court below?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, counsel for the CRA offered no explanation for why it did not
    raise its s. 223(5)(b) argument before the motion judge. Rather, he submitted
    that this court should hear and consider the argument because it was a purely
    legal question, and because doing so would not cause any prejudice to the
    respondents. He suggested that any hardship caused could be addressed through
    costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it
    is obvious that the CRA should have raised its s. 223(5)(b) argument in the
    court below, I am satisfied that this court should consider its arguments on
    the merits. Section 223(5)(b) is obviously closely linked to s. 223(5)(a),
    which was the main provision at issue in the court below. The argument the CRA now
    makes is strictly a legal one, putting this court in as good a position as the
    motion judge to decide it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said,
    as I will explain, I am not persuaded that the CRA fares any better under s.
    223(5)(b) than it does under s. 223(5)(a). In my view, neither provision gets
    the CRA to the result it desires, which is a declaration that it holds a
    “charge” within the meaning of s. 93 of the <em>Land Titles Act.</em></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='
line-height:normal'><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>Do ss. 223(5)(b) and 223(6) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> create a “charge” on land within the meaning of s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles
    Act?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject
    the CRA’s argument that the various statutory provisions it relies on have the
    effect of creating a “charge” on land within the meaning of s. 93(3) of the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em> for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I
    agree with the motion judge that a voluntary act on the part of the land owner
    is necessary to create a charge under s. 93 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. As
    the CRA’s liens are created by statute rather than by the voluntary act of the
    land owner, they do not qualify as a “charge” within the meaning of s. 93 of
    the <em>Land Titles Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the provisions of the various Ontario tax collections statutes on which the CRA
    relies, contain their own priority provisions. The priority they create is not
    the same as the priority created under s. 93 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>.
    Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the Legislature intended to create “a
    charge” within the meaning of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> when it enacted the
    various tax collection provisions on which the CRA relies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally,
    I see nothing in the <em>Keith G. Collins Ltd.</em> decision that assists the
    CRA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    with my first point, to qualify as a “charge” within the meaning of s. 93(3) of
    the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, and to obtain the benefit of the priority
    conferred by that subsection, in my view, the CRA's liens would have to have
    been the product of a voluntary act on the part of the registered owner of the
    lands in question. As they were not the product of a voluntary act of the
    registered owner, but rather were conferred by statute, it follows that the CRA
    liens do not qualify as a “charge” under s. 93(3).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the
    motion judge explained, s. 93(1) of the <em>Land Titles Act </em>stipulates
    that <em>a registered owner of land</em> may charge land in one of two
    fashions: i) with the payment of money, or ii) as security for any other
    purpose. Here, Mr. Tran did neither.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    68(1) of the<em> Land Titles Act </em>reinforces this interpretation of s. 93
    because it states that “<em>[n]o person</em>, <em>other than the registered
    owner</em>, <em>is entitled</em> <em>to</em> transfer or <em>charge registered
    freehold</em> or leasehold land <em>by a registered disposition”</em> (emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act </em>provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The <em>charge</em>, when registered, confers upon the chargee
    a charge upon the interest of the chargor as appearing in the register subject
    to the encumbrances and qualifications to which the chargor’s interest is
    subject, but free from any unregistered interest in the land.<em> </em>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    opinion, it is apparent from the use of the words “[t]he charge” as the opening
    words of s. 93(3), that it is the charge referred to in that section, or at the
    very least, elsewhere in the<em> Land Titles Act</em>, that obtains the
    priority conferred by s. 93(3).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the CRA
    liens do not fall within the definition of “charge” in s. 93(3) of the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em> because they do not arise through the voluntary act of the
    landowner, the definition of “charge” in s. 2 of the <em>Land Registration
    Reform Act</em> is of no assistance to the CRA. It is s. 93(3) of the<em> Land
    Titles Act </em>that confers priority over prior unregistered interests. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the wording of the registered memorial upon which the CRA relied (i.e., the one
    filed under the <em>Income Tax Act</em>) does not assist it.<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> That memorial stipulates the priority of the lien and charge of which it
    provides notice.<em> </em>It says the lien has priority over “all encumbrances
    or claims registered or attaching to the subject property <em>subsequent</em> to the registration of this notice” (emphasis added). However, it was agreed
    for the purposes of the motion, that the respondents would be successful in
    obtaining a declaration of their unregistered equitable interests as of a date <em>prior</em> to the registration of the CRA liens.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, I
    reach the same conclusion about the effect of the various Ontario taxing
    statutes upon which the CRA relies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I
    explained above, the CRA referred to s. 17.1 of the <em>Fuel Tax Act</em> as an
    example of the wording in Ontario tax collection statutes to argue that its
    liens constitute a charge under the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. The CRA submits
    that s. 223(5)(b) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> incorporates the remedies
    contained in the Ontario tax collection statutes. It relies on the fact that
    one of those remedies is to create “a lien and charge” on the taxpayer’s
    interest in real property. It contends that by conferring a “lien and charge”
    on real property the Ontario taxing statutes create “a charge” within the
    meaning of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    view, the “lien and charge” conferred by the Ontario taxing statutes is not “a
    charge” within the meaning of s. 93 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> for the
    reasons I have already explained – fundamentally, the lien and charge does not
    arise through the voluntary act of the real property owner. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Equally
    important, however, is the fact that the Ontario tax collection statutes
    stipulate the priority of the “lien and charge” they create – and that priority
    is not the equivalent of the priority created under s. 93(3) of the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, for
    example, s. 17.1(3)(c) of the <em>Fuel Tax Act</em> stipulates that the lien
    and charge it confers upon registration against real property has priority over
    “<em>any</em> … <em>claim</em> that is registered against or<em> that otherwise
    arises</em> and affects the taxpayer’s property <em>after</em> the notice [of
    the lien and charge] is registered.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On its
    face, s.17.1 does not purport to give the lien and charge it creates priority
    over any claim against real property that arose <em>before</em> registration of
    notice of the lien and charge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the
    priority created by s. 17.1 of the <em>Fuel Tax Act</em> is different than the
    priority created by s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, in my view, it
    would be inconsistent to hold that s. 17.1 of the <em>Fuel Tax Act</em> has the
    effect of creating “a charge” within the meaning of s. 93 of the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    opinion, therefore, the Ontario taxing statutes on which the CRA relies assist neither
    its argument that its memorials constitute “charges” within the meaning of the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em>; nor its claim that it is entitled to priority over equitable
    interests hypothetically declared to exist prior to the date on which the CRA’s
    liens were registered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, on
    my reading of the <em>Keith G. Collins Ltd.</em> decision, that case does not
    assist the CRA. Although the court relied in part on the priority <a
name=par11></a>created by the combined operation of s. 223(5)(b) of the <em>Income
    Tax Act</em> and the <em>Tax Administration and Miscellaneous Taxes Act</em>,
    C.C.S.M. c. T.2 (the “Manitoba Taxing Statute”), it was the priority created in
    relation to personal property under s. 66 of the Manitoba Taxing Statute that
    was relevant. In contrast, s. 65 of the Manitoba Taxing Statute gives a
    certificate of a tax debt registered against real property the same priority as
    a judgment of the court.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two final
    points. One, the claims advanced by Ms. Trang and Ms. Nguyen are equitable in
    nature. Accordingly, it seems to me that, rather than being determined on a
    Rule 21 motion, the issue of their priority is one uniquely for the trial
    judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, one of the issues the trial judge may consider in assessing Ms.
    Nguyen’s constructive trust claim is the equities as between her and the CRA:
    see <em>Stevens v. Stevens </em>(2006), 214 O.A.C. 201 (C.A.), at para. 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two, I
    feel obliged to observe that, like the Ontario tax collection statutes, s.
    223(6) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> appears to stipulate the priority of the
    memorial registered under that section. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, s. 223(6) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> provides that, once
    registered, a memorial evidencing a debt for income tax is subordinate to any
    “charge, lien, priority or binding interests in respect of which all steps
    necessary to make it effective against other creditors were taken” before the
    memorial was registered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    the CRA nor the respondents made submissions concerning the effect of this
    aspect of s. 223(6). Accordingly, I will not comment further other than to
    observe that, if the CRA intended to rely on this provision, it should have raised
    it. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='
line-height:normal'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the CRA’s interest in Mr. Tran's properties subject to a constructive
    trust claim by his spouse?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CRA
    claims that s. 62 of the <em>Land Titles Act </em>prohibits registration of “a
    notice of an express, implied or constructive trust”. Ms. Nguyen does not
    dispute that. However, that does not mean she is disentitled from registering a
    vesting order in the event she is successful in obtaining a declaration that
    she is entitled to an interest in Mr. Tran’s property by way of constructive
    trust. As I have explained, it will be open to the trial judge to take account
    of the equities between Ms. Nguyen and the CRA in deciding as of what date any
    such interest will be effective.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='
line-height:normal'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge err in his findings of fact relating to the nature
    of Ms. Trang's interest?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 2
    of his reasons, the motion judge said that, in addition to the $250,000
    equitable mortgage Ms. Trang claims against the Epworth and Granton Avenue
    properties arising from a December 2003 agreement, Ms. Trang claims a $100,000
    equitable mortgage arising from the same agreement. We agree that this is a
    factual error. The pleadings in Ms. Trang’s action assert a debt arising in
    2008 as the basis for the claim regarding the $100,000 equitable mortgage. This
    claim was therefore not part of the Rule 21 motion. Ms. Trang does not contend
    otherwise.</p>
  <h1>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that
    there were arguments raised for the first time on appeal which should have been
    raised and dealt with in the court below, I would award the costs of the appeal
    to the respondents on a substantial indemnity basis. Accordingly, costs are
    awarded to Ms. Trang fixed in the amount of $24,000 and costs are awarded to
    Ms. Nguyen fixed in the amount of $22,000.</p>
