  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justices Katherine E. Swinton,
    Jennifer Mackinnon and Gladys I. Pardu of the Superior Court of Justice,
    sitting as the Divisional Court, dated December 22, 2011.</p>
  <p class=Judge>By The Court:</p>
  <p class=Heading>I.        Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order of P. Perell J. of the Superior Court of Justice, dated May 13,
    2011, Terence Williams’ motion for an order certifying this proceeding as a
    class proceeding under the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c.
    6 (the “Act”) was dismissed on the basis that Mr. Williams does not have a
    cause of action for negligence or negligent misrepresentation against the
    appellant municipality, the City of Toronto (the “City”).  In these
    circumstances, the motion judge held that Mr. Williams did not meet the cause
    of action criterion for certification, set out in s. 5(1)(a) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, a majority of the Divisional Court, Swinton and Mackinnon JJ.,
    disagreed with the motion judge and reversed his ruling.  In their view, it is
    not plain and obvious that the City owes no duty of care to Mr. Williams. 
    Consequently, they concluded that the statutory cause of action criterion for
    certification had been met.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice G. Pardu dissented.  In her view, Mr. Williams has no cause of
    action against the City either for breach of statutory duty or negligence
    because neither Mr. Williams nor the other proposed class members stand in a
    proximate relationship with the City.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, by order dated December 22, 2011, the Divisional Court
    set aside the motion judge’s order, certified this proceeding as a class
    proceeding, and referred the matter back to the motion judge to make the
    necessary order converting Mr. Williams’ application to an action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City now appeals to this court.  Its principal argument is that the
    majority of the Divisional Court erred in characterizing the nature of the
    relationship between Mr. Williams and the City.  Contrary to the majority’s
    holding, the City says, the facts of this case do not show a specific and
    special relationship between the City and Mr. Williams sufficient to ground a
    cause of action in negligence against the City.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude that the appeal must be dismissed for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>II.       Discussion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Williams is a rooming house and bachelorette apartment tenant in the
    Parkdale area of Toronto.  He is the proposed representative plaintiff in this
    proceeding, which he brings on his own behalf and on behalf of
    similarly-situated Parkdale tenants.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core of Mr. Williams’ claim is that the City was negligent in
    failing to deliver to him and to other tenants in the proposed class
    statutorily-mandated notices informing the class members of their entitlement
    to reduce the rents paid to their landlords in accordance with a rent reduction
    scheme set out in the <em>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</em>, S.O. 2006, c.
    17 (the “RTA”) and predecessor legislation.  Mr. Williams alleges that because
    of the City’s negligent failure to deliver the requisite notices, the class
    members failed to receive reductions in their rent during a five-year period
    and cannot now claim relief elsewhere.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge held that the City owed no duty of care to Mr. Williams
    or the other class members.  He recognized that to determine whether a duty of
    care exists in tort, the relationship between the parties must be examined to
    ascertain whether there is sufficient foreseeability and proximity to establish
    a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care.  Further, if such a duty arises, it must
    still be determined whether policy considerations exist that would negate or
    limit the duty of care. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that the foreseeability requirement was met in this case.  The
    occurrence of harm if the City failed to deliver the requisite rent reduction
    notices was foreseeable.  However, the motion judge also held that the
    relationship between the parties was not sufficiently close to satisfy the
    proximity requirement for the imposition of a duty of care.  Further, in his
    view, several policy considerations negated any <em>prima facie</em> duty of
    care that might otherwise be said to exist.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two main difficulties with the motion judge’s proximity analysis.  First,
    the motion judge examined the applicable statutory regime established by the
    RTA and its predecessor statute and the City’s obligations thereunder.  This
    was certainly the correct starting point for analysis of the relationship
    between the parties.  But the motion judge failed to also consider the facts
    pleaded by Mr. Williams regarding the relationship between the parties.  As
    counsel for the City candidly acknowledged before this court, the necessary
    proximity analysis to determine whether the City owed Mr. Williams a duty of
    care required consideration of both the applicable statutory scheme and the
    facts pleaded by Mr. Williams.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority of the Divisional Court was alive to this issue, observing, at paras.
    34 and 45, that regard must be had to the governing statute and to the alleged
    factual relationship between the parties, as pleaded.  The majority put it this
    way, at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he statute is only the beginning of the analysis to
    determine whether there is sufficient proximity to found a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care.  It is necessary, as well, to consider whether the relationship
    between the City and [Mr. Williams], a Parkdale rooming house tenant, would be
    sufficient to find proximity.  In the context of s. 5(1)(a) of the [Act], the
    question is whether it is plain and obvious that there is insufficient
    proximity to found a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care to [Mr. Williams] and
    the other Parkdale rooming house tenants.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>We agree with this analysis.  Moreover, we did not
    understand counsel for the City to argue otherwise.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    and importantly, the ‘plain and obvious’ test is an exacting one.  In the
    context of the cause of action certification criterion under s. 5(1)(a) of the
    Act, the issue is whether it is plain and obvious, based on the governing
    statutory regime and the pleadings, that Mr. Williams’ claim against the City
    cannot succeed.  For the purpose of this test, the material facts pleaded are
    to be accepted as true and the pleading is to be read generously.  Moreover, as
    the majority of the Divisional Court noted, unsettled or novel matters of law
    should be permitted to proceed, so that they can be determined on the basis of
    a complete evidentiary record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not satisfied that the high ‘plain and obvious’ threshold is met in this
    case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    City acknowledges that it was obliged to deliver the statutory rent reduction
    notices in question and that it failed to do so.  It further accepts the motion
    judge’s finding that the alleged harm occasioned by its failure to deliver the
    rent reduction notices was foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    in addition to these admitted facts, Mr. Williams pleaded that he and similarly-situated
    tenants were part of a specific City project in the Parkdale area of Toronto –
    the Parkdale Pilot Project – that was intended to regularize illegal and/or unlicensed
    rooming house apartment buildings to bring them into conformity with the City’s
    land use by-laws.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    pleaded, one of the significant components of the Parkdale Pilot Project involved
    statutory amendments to facilitate property tax savings for Parkdale landlords
    and corresponding rental savings for affected Parkdale rooming house tenants, including
    Mr. Williams and other proposed class members.  Mr. Williams also pleaded that
    his ability and that of other class members to learn of their entitlement to
    rent reductions hinged on receipt of the relevant rent reduction notices from
    the City.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the majority of the Divisional Court that it is not plain and
    obvious that these pleaded facts, if proven, are insufficient to establish that
    the City owed Mr. Williams and other class members a private law duty of care
    as a result of a specific and special relationship between the parties arising
    from the Parkdale Pilot Project.  As the majority of the Divisional Court put
    it, at paras. 43 and 46, on the facts pleaded: “[Mr. Williams] and the class
    members fell within a specific group of tenants targeted by the City in the
    Parkdale Pilot Project” and, “[I]t is arguable that there is sufficient
    proximity to found a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care when the statutory duty
    to give notice is considered in light of the facts as pleaded showing the
    relationship between the City and the Parkdale tenants arising as a result of
    the Parkdale Pilot Project.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are also not persuaded, at this early stage, that it is plain and obvious that
    policy considerations would inevitably operate to negate any private law duty
    of care otherwise found to attach to the City.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts as pleaded by Mr. Williams, there is no suggestion that a private law
    duty of care attaches generally to the City in respect of all tenants in the
    City who are entitled to rent reduction notices.  The case put against the City
    is confined to a duty allegedly owed to a discrete subgroup of Toronto tenants
    – those like Mr. Williams, who were targeted by the City in the Parkdale Pilot
    Project.  Further, in our view, in the absence of a complete exchange of
    pleadings and a full evidentiary record, it cannot be said that the policy
    considerations identified by the motion judge (the suggested danger of
    indeterminate liability for the City and the inappropriateness of allegedly
    shifting landlords’ financial obligations for rent reductions to the City)
    would necessarily operate to negate any private law duty of care on the City’s
    part, arising from the alleged special relationship between the parties.</p>
  <p class=Heading>III.      Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  Mr. Williams’ brief written
    submissions concerning the costs of the appeal shall be delivered to the
    Registrar of the court by Friday, January 11, 2013.  The City’s brief
    responding costs submissions shall be similarly delivered, within ten days
    thereafter. </p>
