    the Superior Court of Justice, dated August 1, 2012, with reasons reported at 2012
    ONSC 4440, 112 O.R. (3d) 252.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Hoy J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff and the defendant Kyle Cresswell (“Cresswell”) were
    involved in an automobile accident.  Cresswell was
    driving an uninsured vehicle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario requires that all auto insurance policies provide uninsured automobile
    coverage. Therefore, in the normal course, the plaintiff’s insurance company –
    the defendant CAA Insurance Company (Ontario) (“CAA”) – would be liable to
    cover any amount that Cresswell is found to owe the plaintiff, up to policy
    limits.  The plaintiff, however, breached the policy by knowingly driving with
    a suspended driver’s licence and CAA denied coverage as a result</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motor Vehicle Accident Claim Fund (the “Fund”), Ontario’s
    government-operated insurer of last resort, provides compensation to persons
    injured in an automobile accident where there is no other insurance that would
    cover the claim.  The Minister of Finance, which administers the Fund, brought
    a cross-claim against CAA on behalf of Cresswell, seeking a declaration that
    the plaintiff was entitled to coverage despite his breach of the policy. The cross-claim
    was filed more than two years after Cresswell had been served with the
    plaintiff’s Statement of Claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises two issues.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first is whether the insured plaintiff’s admitted breach of the
    policy – knowingly driving with a suspended driver’s licence – disentitles him
    to uninsured automobile coverage under the policy.  I conclude that it does
    not.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue is whether the Minister’s cross-claim is time-barred by
    virtue of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched B. I
    conclude that the <em>Limitations Act</em> applies and therefore the Minister’s
    cross-claim is out of time.  However, for the reasons below, I would not give
    effect to the limitation period argument at this time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would dismiss this appeal.  </p>
  <h1>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action arose out of a motor vehicle accident on November 11, 2006.  The
    plaintiff, Shane Bruinsma, drove a vehicle owned and insured by his girlfriend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff’s driver’s licence had been suspended as the result of a
    conviction under the <em>Criminal Code</em> for driving with more than the
    prescribed limit of alcohol in his blood.  While suspended, he was convicted
    for driving while disqualified, and his suspension was extended.  As a result
    of the suspensions, the plaintiff was unable to obtain insurance for his
    vehicle. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subject
    to specified exceptions, a vehicle owner’s standard automobile insurance policy
    covers persons, in addition to the owner, who use or operate the owner’s
    vehicle.  The plaintiff accordingly transferred his vehicle to his girlfriend
    for no consideration, and she proceeded to obtain the policy at issue with CAA.
     On the day of the accident, the plaintiff’s girlfriend gave him the only set
    of keys to the vehicle, knowing that the plaintiff was disqualified from
    driving.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff alleges he suffered injuries as a result of Cresswell’s negligence.  On
    December 4, 2008, the plaintiff sued Cresswell; the uninsured vehicle’s owner,
    Ronald Cresswell; and CAA.  In its Statement of Defence and Cross-claim, dated
    May 7, 2009, CAA asserted that the plaintiff was not entitled to coverage because
    he breached the policy by driving without a valid licence.  CAA also cross-claimed
    against Cresswell and Ronald Cresswell.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 26, 2011, the Minister brought its cross-claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAA
    then brought a motion for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the
    plaintiff’s claim for uninsured automobile coverage under the policy and the cross-claim
    brought by the Minister in the name of Cresswell.  CAA argued both that the
    plaintiff was not entitled to coverage under the policy because he knowingly
    drove with a suspended driver’s licence and that the Minister’s cross-claim on
    behalf of Cresswell was barred by the <em>Limitations Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the plaintiff took no position on the summary judgment motion, and agreed
    to dismiss the action against CAA on a without costs basis.  The only party
    that opposed CAA’s motion for summary judgment was the Minister, on behalf of
    Cresswell. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that the plaintiff was covered by the policy, and that
    the <em>Limitations Act</em> does not apply to a cross-claim made by the
    Minister on behalf of a defendant pursuant to s. 8(2) of the <em>Motor Vehicle
    Accident Claims Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.41 (the “MVACA”). He accordingly
    dismissed CAA’s motion for summary judgment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAA
    appeals that order. </p>
  <h1>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INTERPRETATION OF THE POLICY</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A  Framework</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interpretation issue involves the interplay of the <em>Insurance Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, (the “Act”); <span class=FootnoteTextEmphasisChar>Uninsured
    Automobile Coverage</span>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 676 (“Reg. 676”); the Schedule that
    forms part of Reg. 676 (the “Schedule”); and the auto insurance policy itself.  All
    of these must be considered to determine if the plaintiff is entitled to
    uninsured automobile coverage under the policy. </p>
  <h6><span style='font-weight:normal'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Act, Reg. 676 and the Schedule</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    January 1, 1969, the Act has provided that certain “statutory conditions” –
    including the condition that the insured not drive or operate or permit any
    other person to drive or operate the automobile unless the insured or other
    person is authorized by law to drive or operate it – are deemed to be part of
    certain types of insurance contracts of automobile insurance. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    current iteration of this deeming provision, s. 234(1) of the Act, was enacted
    on January 1, 1994.  It provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>The conditions prescribed by the regulations made
    under paragraph 15.1 of subsection 121 (1) are statutory conditions and shall
    be deemed to be part of every contract to which they apply and shall be printed
    in English or French in every policy to which they apply with the heading
    “Statutory Conditions” or “Conditions légales”,  as may be appropriate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until
    January 1, 1994, the statutory conditions were set out in the Act. Section 121(1)(15.1),
    also enacted on January 1, 1994, provided for the statutory conditions to be
    set out in a regulation to the Act:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make
    regulations... for the purpose of section 234, prescribing statutory conditions
    and the types of contracts of automobile insurance to which the statutory
    conditions apply[.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>O.
    Reg. 777/93, in force on January 1, 1994,  prescribed the following statutory
    condition:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>4. (1) The insured shall not drive or operate or
    permit any other person to drive or operate the automobile unless the insured
    or other person is authorized by law to drive or operate it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    condition is identical to that set out in the <em>Act</em> prior to 1994: see R.S.O.
    1990, c. I-8, s. 234(2)(5)(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    on January 1, 1994, s. 234(3) was also enacted:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><em>Except as otherwise provided in the contract</em>,
    the statutory conditions referred to in subsection (1) <em>do not apply to the
    insurance required by section 265 or 268. </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    265 requires uninsured automobile coverage.  Effective March 1, 1980, uninsured
    automobile coverage, which had been optional and limited in scope since 1969,
    became mandatory. The purpose of the provision was to spread the risk of
    uninsured drivers among drivers (through insurance policies) rather than among
    the tax base generally (through the Fund): see <em>Chambo v. Musseau</em> (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 305 (C.A.), at para. 11.  Section 265(1) of the Act
    requires that every contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy
    provide, <em>inter alia</em>, for payment to an insured of all sums the insured
    is entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an uninsured automobile as
    damages for bodily injury, “subject to the terms, conditions, provisions,
    exclusions and limits as are prescribed by the regulations.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    1 of Reg. 676 provides that “[t]he terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions
    and limits set out in the following Schedule apply to payments under a motor
    vehicle liability policy under subsection 265 (1) of the Act and shall be
    attached to or included in every motor vehicle liability policy, as a Schedule
    in or to the policy.” The content of this regulation is unchanged from its
    original enactment as R.R.O. 1980, Reg. 535.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Statutory Condition 4(1) is not set out in the Schedule, s. 10 of the Schedule
    provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>In so far as applicable, the general provisions,
    definitions, exclusions and <em>statutory conditions</em> as contained in a
    motor vehicle liability policy also apply to payments under the contract under
    subsection 265 (1) of the Act. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    234(3) of the Act made a substantive change to the existing statutory scheme
    for uninsured automobile coverage on January 1, 1994.  Before it was enacted,
    the Act did not provide that the statutory conditions do not apply to the
    mandatory scheme of uninsured automobile coverage.</p>
  <h6><span style='font-weight:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span>      The policy</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    policy is in the form known as “OAP 1” – the Ontario Automobile Policy approved
    by the Superintendent of Financial Services for use as the Standard Owner’s
    Policy on or after June 1, 2005.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OAP
    1 is comprised of eight Sections and an introductory summary at the beginning
    of the policy, which provides a summary of each of the Sections.  The summary
    and Sections 1, 5 and 8 are relevant to this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    summary of Section 1 at the beginning of the policy provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Introduction</span></strong> contains information that applies to the entire policy. In order to understand
    what is covered and what is not covered by each coverage, you should read
    Sections 1 and 2 and the <em>entire</em> Section of the policy that deals with
    the specific coverage. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    1.4 provides:</p>

  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion Judge’s Reasons</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s reasons can be summarized as follows.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is an irreconcilable conflict between s. 243(3) of the Act and s. 10 of the
    Schedule and where there is a conflict between a regulation and a statute, the
    statute prevails. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    policy does not provide that the statutory conditions are to apply to uninsured
    automobile coverage.  Indeed, section 5.9.1 of the policy provides that no
    person has a right to sue for compensation under Section 5 of the policy “unless
    the conditions in this Section of your policy (Uninsured Automobile Coverage) have
    been met.”  Only a breach of one of the conditions in Section 5 will take away
    an insured’s right to uninsured automobile coverage.  There is no term in
    section 5 which provides for a denial of coverage where the vehicle is driven,
    or permitted to be driven, by a person who is not authorized by law to drive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    1.4 of the policy provides that, “If you fail to meet your responsibilities,
    claims under this policy, with the exception of certain Accident Benefits, <em>may</em> be denied.” Section 1.4.5, on which CAA also relies, follows, section 1.4.  A
    clause that states that claims “may be denied” cannot clearly be found to
    preclude access to uninsured automobile coverage: see <em>Matt v. Crawford</em> (2010), 103 O.R. (3d) 715 (S.C.). Moreover, the clause must be included in
    Section 5 of the policy to take away an insured’s right to uninsured automobile
    coverage.  Therefore a breach of s. 1.4.5 does not entitle CAA to deny
    coverage.  </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that the plaintiff is not disentitled
    to uninsured automobile coverage under the policy because he drove without a
    valid licence, although my reasoning is somewhat different.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, both provisions of the policy CAA relies on to deny coverage – s.
    1.4.5 and s. 4(1) of Section 8 – are “statutory conditions”.  As such, pursuant
    to s. 234(3) of the Act, they do not apply to uninsured automobile coverage
    unless otherwise provided in the contract.  On my reading, the contract at
    issue, OAP 1, does not otherwise provide.  Accordingly, CAA cannot rely on them
    to deny coverage. </p>
  <h6><span style='font-weight:normal'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sections 1.4.5 and 4(1) of Section 8, are statutory conditions</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    address first my conclusion that both s. 1.4.5 and s. 4(1) are statutory
    conditions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wording of s. 1.4.5 is the same in all material respects to that of statutory
    condition 4(1), and the insurer indicated in its summary of Section 8 of the
    policy that statutory conditions have been included in each Section of the
    policy where they apply, for convenience. Consequently, in my view, s. 1.4.5 is
    a statutory condition included in Section 1 for convenience.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion makes it unnecessary to embark on the separate analysis of s. 1.4.5
    conducted by the motion judge on the basis that it was a general term of the
    policy, and not a statutory condition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will, however, comment that I do not endorse the motion judge’s reasoning that
    a clause, such as s. 1.4 of the policy, providing that an insurer “may” deny
    coverage, cannot preclude coverage.  Such an interpretation would render s. 1.4
    meaningless.  To the extent that <em>Matt v. Crawford</em> relied on the same
    reasoning, I disagree with that case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis that s. 1.4.5 was a general provision of the policy, and not a
    statutory condition, CAA argued that the motion judge also erred in concluding
    that the provision had to be included in Section 5 of the policy to take away
    the insured’s right to uninsured automobile coverage.  This, it submits,
    ignores this court’s decisions in <em>Ortiz v. Dominion of Canada General
    Insurance</em> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 130 (C.A.); and <em>Shipman v. Dominion of
    Canada General Insurance Co.</em> (2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 144 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Ortiz</em>, this court found that the general provision in the insurer’s
    standard motor vehicle policy limiting coverage to accidents occurring in
    Canada or the United States applied to the uninsured automobile coverage
    mandated by the Act through the operation of s. 10 of the Schedule. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Shipman</em>, this court held that the exclusion of coverage where an
    automobile is used without the owner’s consent, set out in s. 1.8.2 of the
    policy, applied to uninsured automobile coverage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is quite different from both <em>Ortiz</em> and <em>Shipman</em>.  The
    general provisions considered in those cases were not statutory conditions, and
    neither s. 234(3) nor a comparable provision applied.</p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The policy does not otherwise provide that the statutory
    condition is to apply</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next question to be addressed is whether the contract “otherwise provides” that
    the statutory condition shall apply to the uninsured automobile coverage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded by CAA’s argument that section 10 of the Schedule is part of
    the policy, either by operation of s. 5.1.1 of the policy itself, or by virtue
    of Reg. 676; Section 10 of the Schedule provides that the statutory conditions
    are to apply to uninsured automobile coverage; and the contract therefore
    “otherwise provides” that the statutory conditions are to apply to uninsured
    automobile coverage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated above, the motion judge concluded that there was an irreconcilable
    conflict between s. 234(3) of the Act and s. 10 of the Schedule.  The Act
    provides that statutory conditions do not apply to uninsured automobile
    coverage unless the contract otherwise provides; the Schedule to Regulation 676
    provides that in so far as applicable, the statutory conditions apply.  As the
    motion judge noted, it is an established principle of statutory interpretation
    that regulations are subordinate legislation and in the event of conflict with
    the statute, the statute prevails.  Therefore, he reasoned, in light of this
    conflict, the Act prevails over the Schedule, the statutory conditions do not
    apply to uninsured automobile coverage unless the policy otherwise provides,
    and the policy does not “otherwise provide”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    reasoning is different.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>If one considers the sequence in which the provisions were
    enacted, the apparent conflict between s. 234(3) of the Act and s. 10 of the<em> </em>Schedule is resolved, although CAA’s position must nonetheless be
    rejected.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As
    discussed above, in 1969, the legislature first enacted optional uninsured
    automobile coverage.  At the same time, it specified various conditions – the
    “statutory conditions” – that were deemed to be part of every motor vehicle
    insurance contract to which they applied. In 1980, uninsured automobile
    coverage became mandatory.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1994, the legislature amended the Act to provide that the statutory conditions
    do not apply to uninsured automobile coverage “except as otherwise provided”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  It
    did not amend any part of Reg. 676. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>Significantly, section 10 of the Schedule begins with the
    words “In so far as applicable...”  In my view, by subsequently enacting a
    statutory provision that specifically provides that “[e]xcept as provided in
    the contract” the statutory conditions do not apply to uninsured automobile
    coverage, the legislature signified that the statutory conditions are not
    applicable to uninsured automobile coverage unless the contract itself explicitly
    otherwise provides.  Accordingly, statutory condition 4(1) does not apply to
    uninsured automobile coverage under the policy either by operation of s. 5.1.1
    of the policy or by virtue of Reg. 676.<em> </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge that the policy does not otherwise provide that the
    statutory conditions are to apply to uninsured automobile coverage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    summary of Section 1 at the beginning of the policy indicates that Section 1
    contains information that applies to the entire policy.  In my view, this is
    not sufficient to override the statutory directive that statutory conditions do
    not apply to uninsured automobile coverage and make s. 1.4.5 applicable to the
    uninsured automobile coverage in Section 5 of the policy.</p>
  <h1>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE LIMITATION PERIOD ISSUE</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that the motion judge erred in concluding that the
    effect of s. 8 of the MVACA<em> </em>is that the <em>Limitations Act</em> does
    not apply to the Minister’s cross-claim on behalf of Cresswell.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cresswell
    was served with the Statement of Claim on January 27, 2009. Notice of the
    defendant Cresswell’s default in filing a statement of defence was sent to the
    Minister on November 5, 2009, as required by s. 8(1) of the MVACA. This
    triggered the application of s. 8(2) of the MVACA: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Within thirty days after receiving notice under
    subsection (1), the Minister may file a defence, make payment into court,
    appear by counsel at the trial or take such other action as he or she considers
    appropriate on behalf and in the name of the defendant, and may thereupon, on
    behalf and in the name of the defendant, conduct the defence, and may, where he
    or she considers it advisable to do so, consent to judgment in such amount as
    he or she may consider proper in all the circumstances, and all acts done in
    accordance therewith shall be deemed to be the acts of such defendant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving notice, the Minister could not intervene immediately on Cresswell’s
    behalf because he was represented by counsel at the time.  By July 22, 2010, Cresswell’s
    counsel indicated he would remove himself from the record so that the Minister
    could become involved.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 25, 2011, some sixteen and a half months after receiving notice, the
    Minister forwarded a Statement of Defence and Cross-claim on behalf of
    Cresswell to the other parties.  On April 4, 2011, counsel for the Fund filed a
    requisition to have the noting in default of Cresswell set aside.  On May 26,
    2011, the Statement of Defence and Cross-claim was formally filed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found, and it is conceded, that if the <em>Limitations Act </em>applies
    to cross-claims by the Minister under s. 8(2) of the MVACA, the cross-claim is time-barred:
    s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> establishes a two-year limitation period,
    and the effect of s. 18(1) of the <em>Limitations Act</em> is that the
    limitation period began to run when Cresswell was served with the Statement of
    Claim on January 27, 2009.  It had therefore expired by March 27, 2011 when the
    Statement of Defence and Cross-claim was served.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19(1) of the <em>Limitations Act</em> provides that the limitation period set
    out in any other Act is of no effect unless the provision establishing it is
    listed in the Schedule to the <em>Limitations Act</em>.  The MVACA is not
    listed in the Schedule. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that a defendant who is being represented by the
    Minister is treated differently from a regular defendant.  He cited <em>Levesque
    v. Levesque</em>, [2002] O.T.C. 843 (S.C.); <em>Larkman Estate v. Brigshaw</em>,
    [2007] O.J. No. 1656 (S.C.); and <em>Van Kooten v. Day</em> (1981), 31 O.R.
    (2d) 247 (Div. Ct.); for the principle that the Fund’s rights to defend under
    s. 8(2) of the MVACA cannot be taken away through the default of the defendant
    personally.  He accordingly reasoned that the <em>Limitations Act</em> does not
    affect the Minister’s right to defend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also concluded that dismissing the cross-claim would “allow form
    to triumph over substance”. The Fund is an insurer of “last resort”. Section 22
    of the MVACA provides that no amount shall be paid or payable out of the Fund
    in respect of an amount paid or payable by an insurer by reason of the
    existence of a policy of insurance.  If the cross-claim were dismissed, and the
    plaintiff proceeded to obtain judgment against Cresswell and then seek payment
    out of the Fund pursuant to s. 7(1) of the MVACA, the Fund could assert in
    defence that it did not have to pay because the policy should have responded. The
    issue of coverage would then be determined. Since the identical issue would
    eventually be decided, the motion judge elected to avoid a multiplicity of
    proceedings by finally deciding the issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cases relied upon by the Fund and the motion judge must, in my view, be
    distinguished.  As explained below, none addresses the issue of the application
    of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.  Moreover, the limitation argument in this
    case appears to have arisen as a result of delay by the Fund and not through
    any default of the defendant personally.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Levesque</em> and <em>Larkman</em> held that s. 8(2) permitted the Minister to initiate third
    party proceedings notwithstanding that such proceedings were not mentioned in
    s. 8(2).  Such proceedings were within the Minister’s authority to “conduct the
    defence”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Van
    Kooten</em> held that the Minister’s right to defend under s. 8 of the MVACA
    could not be taken away by the inability to produce the defendant for
    discovery.  <em>Larkman</em> applied that to the Minister’s right to bring a
    third party claim.  The issue was whether the Minister could continue to
    conduct a defence and maintain a third party claim in the name of the defendant
    without requiring the defendant to attend an examination for discovery.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge that nothing would be gained by permitting CAA’s
    summary judgment motion to proceed, to the extent it relies on the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>.  However, in my view, given the clear wording of s. 19(2) of the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>, it was not open to the motion judge to conclude that the <em>Limitations
    Act</em> is not applicable to the Minister under the MVACA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would come to the same result as the motion judge by instead staying CAA’s
    summary judgment motion to the extent founded on the limitation argument, on
    this court’s own initiative pursuant to s. 106 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  This section permits a court to stay any proceeding “on
    such terms as are considered just.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Penn-Co Construction Canada (2003) Ltd. v. Constance Lake</em>, 2008 ONCA
    768, 76 C.L.R. (3d) 1, at para. 4, this court observed that “the risk of
    multiplicity of proceedings, the avoidance of cost and inconvenience[,] and the
    risk of inconsistent results are factors to be taken into account in the exercise
    of the discretion conferred by [s. 106].”  In my view, all of these factors
    strongly militate towards staying the CAA’s limitations defence.  To allow it
    to succeed would simply delay the disposition of this case, at the expense of
    judicial economy and expeditious determination of the issues.</p>
