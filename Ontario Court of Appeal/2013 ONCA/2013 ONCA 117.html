  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>O’Connor
    A.C.J.O. and Simmons J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issues before this court concern whether Onex Corporation is
    entitled to reimbursement for defence and settlement costs (“defence costs”)
    under various directors’ and officers’ (“D&amp;O”) liability insurance
    policies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005, Onex, four of its directors and officers – Gerald W. Schwartz,
    Christopher A. Govan, Mark Hilson and Nigel Wright (the “personal defendants”)
    - and others were sued in the state of Georgia by the Trustee of the Magnatrax
    Litigation Trust (the “Georgia Action”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Georgia Action arose out of bankruptcy proceedings involving
    Magnatrax Corporation under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
    Magnatrax was a former subsidiary of Onex. The Magnatrax Litigation Trust was
    established during the Chapter 11 proceedings to pursue claims on behalf of the
    unsecured creditors of Magnatrax and its subsidiaries. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Georgia Action, the Trustee of the Magnatrax Litigation Trust
    alleged that Onex and the personal defendants used their control of Magnatrax
    to enrich themselves at the expense of Magnatrax and ultimately caused
    Magnatrax and its subsidiaries to become insolvent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Georgia Action eventually settled for US$9.25 million. In the course
    of defending the Georgia Action on behalf of itself and the personal
    defendants, Onex incurred close to US$35 million.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like many corporations, Onex regularly purchased D&amp;O liability
    insurance and excess D&amp;O liability insurance to protect both its own
    directors and officers, and also the directors and officers of its
    subsidiaries, from claims arising from their actions while acting in their
    capacity as directors and officers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2008, Onex and the personal defendants commenced this action (the
    “Onex Action”) against American Home Assurance Company<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
background:white'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and various excess insurers
    (“Excess Insurers”). Onex and the personal defendants claimed they were
    entitled to reimbursement for defence costs incurred in the Georgia Action
    under a US$15 million 2004-2005 American Home D&amp;O policy (the “Onex
    2004-2005 Policy”) and under various excess D&amp;O policies purchased for the </p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>2004-2005 policy year (the “2004-2005 Excess
    Policies”).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";background:white'>[2]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, Onex and the personal defendants claimed they were
    entitled to reimbursement under a US$15 million 2002-2003 American Home D&amp;O
    policy (the “Onex 2002-2003 Policy”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While serving as directors and officers of Onex, the personal
    defendants, Wright and Hilson, were also directors and officers of Magnatrax.
    In the Georgia Action, it was alleged that the personal defendants, Schwartz
    and Govan, acted as <em>de facto</em> directors and officers of Magnatrax. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    Onex and the personal defendants commenced the Onex Action, American Home paid
    out US$15 million – the full limit of liability – under a D&amp;O policy issued
    to Magnatrax (the “Magnatrax Run-Off Policy”) to defray the Georgia Action
    defence costs of the personal defendants and two other directors and officers
    of Magnatrax. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Magnatrax Run-Off Policy was issued on May 12, 2003 – on the eve of Magnatrax’s
    insolvency. It was issued in anticipation of Magnatrax ceasing to be an Onex
    subsidiary and therefore ceasing to be covered under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
background:white'>[3]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    defending the Onex Action, American Home and the Excess Insurers claimed that
    Onex learned about the possibility of the Georgia Action in August 2003 and
    gave notice to American Home of that possibility (the “notice of
    circumstances”) in compliance with clause 7(c) of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, as
    well as clause 7(c) of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. Accordingly, under clause
    4(d) of the Onex 2004-2005 Policy, if Onex was entitled to any coverage for
    defence costs in connection with the Georgia Action under its American Home
    D&amp;O policies, it could only be under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy and not
    under the Onex 2004-2005 Policy or the 2004-2005 Excess Policies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    American Home relied on Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, which was
    added effective on the date the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy was issued. American
    Home denied coverage under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy based on its position that
    Endorsement #14 of that policy excludes any Magnatrax-related claims from
    coverage.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    competing motions for summary judgment, Pattillo J. accepted American Home’s
    argument that Onex gave notice of circumstances under clause 7(c) of the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy. Therefore, under clause 4(d) of the Onex 2004-2005 Policy,
    Onex and the personal defendants were not entitled to reimbursement for defence
    costs in connection with the Georgia Action. It followed that the Excess
    Insurers, who had agreed to follow the form of the Onex 2004-2005 Policy, were
    also excluded from liability under the 2004-2005 Excess Policies for any loss
    in respect of the Georgia Action. The motion judge accordingly dismissed Onex’s
    action against the Excess Insurers in reasons dated June 30, 2011 and reported
    at 2011 ONSC 1142, 98 C.C.L.I. (4th) 228 (the “reported reasons”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in his reported reasons, the motion judge rejected American Home’s argument
    that Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy excluded Onex’s claim for
    reimbursement of defence costs in connection with the Georgia Action. He
    concluded that Endorsement #14 does not exclude “any claim by a third party against
    Onex’s directors and officers in their capacity as such for their wrongful acts
    in relation to Magnatrax.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge therefore ordered American Home to pay Onex US$15 million on
    behalf of the personal defendants for defence costs in connection with the
    Georgia Action under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the original summary judgment motions, American Home moved to amend its
    pleadings to further particularize its claim for legal or equitable set-off of
    amounts that it paid under the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy against amounts owing
    under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy. American Home also moved for summary judgment
    on its amended counterclaim. In unreported reasons dated January 20, 2012 (the
    “unreported reasons”), the motion judge permitted American Home to amend its
    pleadings, but went on to dismiss the motion for summary judgment on the claim
    as amended. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American
    Home appeals from the motion judge’s judgments requiring that it pay US$15
    million to Onex and the personal defendants under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy and
    dismissing its claim for set-off.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Onex
    and the personal defendants cross-appeal from that part of the motion judge’s
    judgment dismissing their action for indemnification under the Onex 2004-2005
    Policy and the 2004-2005 Excess Policies. They also cross-appeal from the
    motion judge’s judgment granting American Home leave to amend its pleadings to
    plead set-off (collectively, the “Onex cross-appeal”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, we would allow American Home’s appeal, set aside the
    decision of the motion judge and return the matter to the Superior Court. In
    addition, we would dismiss the Onex cross-appeal.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2002, American Home, which is a member of the American International Group
    (“AIG”), issued the Onex 2002-2003 Policy. The policy covered the period from
    November 29, 2002 to November 29, 2003 and had a US$15 million limit of
    liability. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among
    other things, the Onex 2002-2003 Policy provided “Executive Liability
    Insurance” and “Organization Insurance”. Put briefly, “Executive Liability
    Insurance” coverage requires an insurer to pay defence costs incurred by
    directors and officers of a corporation arising from a proceeding against them
    based on their wrongful conduct as directors and officers of the corporation.
    “Organization Insurance” entitles a corporation to be reimbursed by the insurer
    for defence costs it pays on behalf of its directors and officers for such
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    specifically, the Onex 2002-2003 Policy’s Executive Liability Insurance
    coverage provision provides that American Home would pay the “Loss” of any
    “Insured Person” arising from a “Claim” made against the “Insured Person” for
    any “Wrongful Act” of the “Insured Person”. The Organization Insurance coverage
    provision provides that American Home would pay the “Organization” for such
    loss only to the extent that the Organization has indemnified such “Insured
    Person”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the definition section of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, “Loss” is defined to
    include “Defence Costs”. “Insured Person” is defined to include any Executive
    of Onex or its subsidiaries. “Executive” is defined to include directors and
    officers, and <em>de facto</em> directors and officers, of a corporation, which
    would include Onex and its subsidiaries. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    definitions of “Claim” and “Wrongful Act” are important for the purposes of
    this appeal. The relevant portions of these definitions read as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>“Claim” means:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)   a written demand for monetary, non-monetary or injunctive
    relief;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)   a civil … proceeding for monetary, non-monetary or
    injunctive relief which is commenced by: (i) service of a Writ of Summons,
    Statement of Claim or similar originating legal document; …</p>

    misstatement, misleading statement, omission or act …:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(i) with respect to any Executive of an Organization, by

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clause 7(c) of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy permits an Insured to
    give written notice to the Insurer “of any circumstance which may reasonably be
    expected to give rise to a Claim” to enable the insured to obtain coverage for
    a Claim during the policy period even though the Claim is not advanced until
    after the expiry of the policy period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Endorsement
    #10 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy excludes coverage under the policy for “Loss
    in connection with any Claim made against any Insured in any bankruptcy
    proceeding by or against an Organization, when such Claim is brought by the
    examiner, trustee, receiver, creditors’ committee, trust, liquidator or
    rehabilitator (or any assignee thereof) of such Organization.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, Onex also obtained US$45 million in
    excess “follow form” D&amp;O insurance for the 2002-2003 coverage period from
    various excess insurers other than those involved in these proceedings. Onex
    renewed its D&amp;O policies in each policy year between 2002 and 2005. The
    level of excess coverage increased over this time frame. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 2003, Onex contemplated selling Magnatrax to a third party. The
    proposed sale would have ended Magnatrax’s status as an Onex subsidiary. This,
    in turn, would have removed Magnatrax and its executives from coverage under
    the Onex 2002-2003 Policy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the face of this possibility, Aon on Onex’s behalf, requested a quote from
    American Home for a “run-off” D&amp;O policy. The proposed run-off policy would
    protect Magnatrax and its executives for a period of six years against claims
    commenced after Magnatrax ceased to be an Onex subsidiary (and therefore ceased
    to be protected under Onex’s D&amp;O policies), but which claims related to the
    executives’ conduct or status before Magnatrax ceased to be an Onex subsidiary. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted by the motion judge, American Home’s quote proposed a number of
    endorsements to the run-off policy, including #13 – Non-Pyramiding of Limits;
    and #14 – Absolute Onex Corporation Exclusion – Carve-out for co-defendant with
    Onex Corporation.&nbsp;Underneath the listed exclusions, the following
    appeared: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>NOTE: Endorsements to be added to Onex Corporation Policy </p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. Absolute Exclusion from Magnatrax Corporation; </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    motion judge found that Aon had concerns about American Home’s quote. However,
    the contemplated sale of Magnatrax was abandoned before the concerns were fully
    resolved.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 11, 2003, Aon was advised by the Magnatrax board of directors that
    Magnatrax was intending to file for bankruptcy protection. Aon asked American
    Home to bind coverage for a run-off D&amp;O policy for Magnatrax on an urgent
    basis. On May 12, 2003, American Home issued a Temporary and Conditional Binder
    of Insurance (“Binder”) that described the coverages and endorsements to be
    included in the US$15 million Magnatrax Run-Off Policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted by the motion judge, 13 endorsements were listed in the Binder. In
    particular, Endorsements #12 and #13 were: “12. Non-pyramiding of Limits (To Be
    Manuscripted) and 13. Absolute Onex Corporation Exclusion – Carve-put (sic) for
    co-defendant with Onex Corporation (To Be Manuscripted)”. “To Be Manuscripted”
    means that the wording of these endorsements had not yet been finalized.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Binder also indicated that two endorsements were to be added to the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy. The following language appeared under the listed exclusions: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>NOTE: Endorsements to be added to Onex Corporation Policy</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span

    the Binder indicated that two endorsements were to be manuscripted for the
    Magnatrax Run-Off Policy and two endorsements were to be manuscripted and added
    to the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, ultimately Endorsements #16 and #4 were added to
    the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy and only one endorsement was added to the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy, namely, Endorsement #14. All of these endorsements are
    significant for the purposes of this appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Endorsement
    #16 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy deals with coordinating the limits of

    The letter refers to numerous claims, including breach of fiduciary duty,

    Provided by American Home</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 4, 2005, Aon sent on Onex’s behalf a copy of the complaint in the Georgia
    Action to American Home as notice of a Claim under the Onex 2004-2005 Policy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 15, 2005, American Home denied coverage under that policy because the
    allegations in the Georgia Action pre-dated May 12, 2003. According to American
    Home, the Prior Acts Exclusion in Endorsement #13 of the Onex 2004-2005 Policy
    limited coverage to Wrongful Acts committed after May 12, 2003. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American
    Home also contended that the Claim is excluded because the allegations relate
    to the personal defendants’ actions in a capacity other than as an Executive of
    Onex and subsidiaries of Onex. Finally, American Home raised the possibility
    that coverage was not available because the allegations in the Georgia Action
    involved intentional acts that are excluded from coverage by clauses 4(a) and
    (c) of the Onex 2004-2005 Policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Initially,
    American Home also denied coverage under the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. However,
    on August 28, 2006, American Home’s counsel indicated that coverage would be
    available for the personal defendants under that policy based on Endorsement
    #4. In counsel’s view, this co-defendant endorsement afforded coverage with
    respect to a Claim against Onex Executives provided an Insured under the policy
    remained as a co-defendant in the Claim along with Onex or an Insured Person of
    Onex.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have said, Onex and the personal defendants were jointly represented by
    counsel throughout the Georgia Action and incurred defence costs totalling
    approximately US$35 million and settlement costs of over US$9 million. American
    Home paid out US$15 million – the limit of liability under the Magnatrax
    Run-Off Policy – to reimburse the personal defendants and two other Magnatrax
    directors and officers for their defence costs. Of this US$15 million,
    US$13,881,991.90 was paid to reimburse the personal defendants and the
    remaining US$1,118,008.10 was paid to reimburse the two other Magnatrax
    directors and officers. As noted, Onex and Magnatrax did not obtain excess
    insurance for the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clause 4(d) of the Onex 2004-2005 Policy operates to exclude
    American Home from having to pay any defence costs in connection with the
    Georgia Action under the Onex 2004-2005 Policy. The follow-form 2004-2005
    Excess Policies also excluded the Excess Insurers from any liability in respect
    of the Georgia Action.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy does not exclude
    coverage for any claim by a third party against Onex’s directors and officers
    in their capacity as such for their wrongful acts in relation to Magnatrax, and
    thus, under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, American Home is required to indemnify
    Onex and the personal defendants for defence costs incurred in in relation to
    the Georgia Action. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching these conclusions, the motion judge found, at para. 97, that the terms
    of the D&amp;O policies in issue are clear and unambiguous and that evidence of
    intention adduced by the various parties was inadmissible.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving the motion judge’s decision, American Home brought a motion to amend
    its counterclaim to have the monies owing under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy
    set-off against the US$13,881,991.90 already paid to the personal defendants
    under the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. American Home also moved for summary
    judgment on the set-off issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge granted American Home leave to amend. However, on the motion for
    summary judgment, he dismissed American Home’s counterclaim. In his unreported
    reasons dated January 20, 2012, he found that Endorsement #16 of the Magnatrax
    Run-Off Policy does not reduce the limit of liability of the Magnatrax Run-Off
    Policy, and thus American Home was not entitled to repayment of amounts
    previously paid to the personal defendants under the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy.
    Given his conclusion that American Home was not entitled to repayment, he did
    not consider American Home’s claim for set-off. </p>

    the personal defendants in connection with the Georgia Action? </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)     Did the motion judge err in concluding that Endorsement
    #16 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy does not entitle American Home to set-off

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth noting that American Home accepts that, but for Endorsement #14, it
    would be liable to pay the personal defendants the amounts claimed under the
    Onex 2002-2003 Policy. Thus, American Home accepts that the coverage provisions
    in that policy include the payment of defence costs of the personal defendants
    arising from the Georgia Action.</p>

    its cross-appeal, Onex argues that the motion judge erred in concluding that
    the Onex 2004-2005 Policy and the 2004-2005 Excess Policies did not provide
    coverage because Onex had previously given notice of the circumstances that
    gave rise to the Georgia Action pursuant to the Onex 2002-2003 Policy.<a

    Onex 2002-2003 Policy and the Onex 2004-2005 Policy are claims made and
    reported policies. Losses resulting from a Claim are eligible for coverage
    under a policy if the Claim is made and reported during the policy period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause
    7(c) of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy provides that the period of coverage can be
    extended beyond the Policy Period if an insured party provides notice during
    the Policy Period of circumstances that may lead to a future Claim.  Clause
    7(c) states in relevant part:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If during the Policy Period ... an Organization or an Insured
    shall become aware of any circumstances which may reasonably be expected to
    give rise to a Claim being made against an Insured and shall give written
    notice to the Insurer of the circumstances, the Wrongful Act allegations
    anticipated and the reasons for anticipating such a Claim, with full
    particulars as to dates, persons and entities involved, then a Claim which is
    subsequently made against such Insured and reported to the Insurer alleging,
    arising out of, based upon or attributable to such circumstances or alleging
    any Wrongful Act which is the same as or related to any Wrongful Act alleged or
    contained in such circumstances, shall be considered made at the time such
    notice of such circumstances was given.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause
    7(c) dovetails with clause 4(d) of the standard exclusions in American Home’s
    D&amp;O policies, including the Onex 2004-2005 Policy. Clause 4(d) excludes
    from coverage under the present policy Loss from any Claim arising out of
    Wrongful Acts of which notice has been given under a previous policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cross-appeal turns on whether Onex provided American Home with notice of
    circumstances during the policy period for the Onex 2002-2003 Policy that
    complied with clause 7(c) of that policy. If it did, then coverage under the
    Onex 2004-2005 Policy is excluded pursuant to clause 4(d) and, consequently,
    coverage under the excess insurance follow-form policies would also be
    excluded. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have said at paras. 49-53, on August 1, 2003, Foley and Lardner, counsel for
    the Magnatrax Creditors’ Committee, wrote a letter to counsel for Magnatrax
    asserting that Magnatrax had claims against Onex, the directors and officers of
    Onex, and the directors and officers of Magnatrax. These claims were said to
    arise from “the May 1999, September 1999, and March 2000 transactions, as well
    as the credit facilities and related agreements supporting those transactions.”
    The letter refers to numerous claims, including breach of fiduciary duty,
    aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, “and possibly
    other claims yet to be identified”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 28, 2003, the day before the Onex 2002-2003 Policy was to expire, Aon
    faxed the Foley Letter to American Home. In doing so, Aon referred to both the
    Onex 2002-2003 Policy and the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy and stated that the
    Foley Letter “contains information on a situation which could in future give
    rise to a claim under [those] polic[ies]”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Onex
    argues that the Foley Letter does not satisfy the specificity requirements of
    clause 7(c) of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy in that it does not set out full
    particulars as to dates, persons and entities involved.  Onex contends that the
    letter did not describe the nature of the commercial transactions or Onex’s
    role in them, did not specify any wrongful act that might be alleged, nor did
    it set out the names of the directors and officers who were involved in the
    transactions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The motion judge rejected these same arguments. In his
    reported reasons, he indicated that he was in agreement with U.S. cases holding
    that, in determining whether a notice by an insured to an insurer is
    sufficient, an objective test should be applied having regard to the wording of
    the policy. He held, at para. 136:  “The test is whether the insured
    objectively complied with the notice provision in the Policy”, citing <em>Continental
    Insurance Co. v. Superior Court Los Angeles County</em>, 37 Cal<em>.</em> App.
    4th 69, 80 (1995) and <em>McCullough v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.</em>, 2 F.3d
    110, 113 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no reason to interfere with the motion judge’s finding that the Foley
    Letter contains sufficient particulars to meet the requirements of clause
    7(c).  We agree with the motion judge’s conclusion, at para. 150, that “it sets
    out the specific transactions and agreement involved, the dates of the
    transactions, the claims which are alleged to exist and the entities and
    individuals involved.” What is important here is that Onex, through Aon,
    provided American Home with the specifics of the threatened litigation as those
    specifics were provided to it. It was not necessary for the insured to
    speculate about the names of the individual directors or officers who might be
    named in the threatened litigation. As found by the motion judge, when viewed
    objectively as a whole, the Foley Letter contains sufficient particulars of the
    dates, persons and entities involved to comply with clause 7(c) of the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    share the motion judge’s view that the claims being advanced in the Georgia
    Action are “the same as or related to” the claims asserted in the Foley Letter.
    The Foley Letter referred to claims arising out of transactions in May 1999,
    September 1999 and March 2000. The Georgia Action is based on corporate
    acquisitions by Magnatrax of American Buildings Company in May 1999, Republic
    Builders Products in August 1999, and Jannock Limited in March 2000.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the claims asserted in the Georgia Action against the personal defendants are
    breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, civil
    conspiracy and unjust enrichment. The Foley Letter sets out a number of claims,
    including breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary
    duty and unjust enrichment. Thus, the Foley Letter alleges the same or related
    claims against Onex and the personal defendants as were alleged in the Georgia
    Action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    therefore agree with the motion judge that the Foley Letter meets the
    requirement of clause 7(c) of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy such that the Georgia
    Action constitutes a Claim made during the Policy Period of the Onex 2002-2003
    Policy.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of clause 4(d) of the Onex 2004-2005 Policy, coverage is excluded
    under that policy. Coverage is also excluded under the 2004-2005 Excess
    Policies.</p>

    cross-appeals the motion judge’s order granting American Home leave to amend
    its Amended Amended Statement of Defence and Counterclaim and to further
    particularize its claim for legal or equitable set-off. Onex submits that the
    motion judge erred in failing to find that the set-off issue raised by American
    Home was <em>res judicata</em>. On appeal, Onex advances the same arguments
    that were made to the motion judge on the issue of <em>res judicata</em>. Onex
    also submits, as it did on the motion, that permitting the amendment would
    result in non-compensable prejudice because American Home was effectively
    allowed to bolster arguments that had already been considered and rejected by
    the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dealt with these arguments at para. 30 of his unreported January
    20, 2012 reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, <em>res judicata </em>does not apply to American
    Home’s proposed amendments. Cause of action estoppel is not applicable. Nor, in
    my view, is issue estoppel. The issues of whether the limits of the Magnatrax
    Policy were reduced by the limits of the 2002-2003 D&amp;O Policy and whether
    American Home was entitled to a refund of amounts paid under the Magnatrax
    Policy were not decided by me. The former issue was pleaded but not argued. The
    latter issue is a corollary which arises only on a determination of the first
    issue. The Action, and specifically the counterclaim has not been concluded.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no reason to interfere with the motion judge’s exercise of discretion
    permitting American Home to amend its pleadings. The motion judge had not yet
    decided whether the limits of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy were reduced by the
    Onex 2002-2003 Policy, nor the corollary issue of whether American Home was
    entitled to a refund of amounts paid under the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. We

    para. 27. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Kentucky
    Fried Chicken Canada v. Scott’s Food Services Inc.</em>, 114 O.A.C. 357, at
    para. 25, this court referred to the need to examine the language of a contract
    in light of the surrounding circumstances:  “While the task of interpretation
    must begin with the words of the document and their ordinary meaning, the
    general context that gave birth to the document or its ‘factual matrix’ will
    also provide the court with useful assistance.”  In cases of insurance
    contracts, the evidence of the factual matrix may be of more assistance when
    the contract is an individually negotiated contract rather than a standard form
    contract resulting from a routine purchase of an insurance policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it
    may, before reaching a finding that a contractual provision is ambiguous, the
    court must assess the words of a contract in light of the factual matrix in
    which the agreement was written. As Doherty J.A. stated in <em>Dumbrell v. The
    Regional Group of Companies Inc.</em>, 2007 ONCA 59, 85 O.R. (3d) 616, at para.
    54: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>A consideration of the context in which the written agreement
    was made is an integral part of the interpretative process and is not something
    that is resorted to only where the words viewed in isolation suggest some
    ambiguity.&nbsp; To find ambiguity, one must come to certain conclusions as to
    the meaning of the words used.&nbsp; A conclusion as to the meaning of words used
    in a written contract can only be properly reached if the contract is
    considered in the context in which it was made:&nbsp; see McCamus, <em>The Law
    of Contracts</em> (Toronto:&nbsp; Irwin Law, 2005) at 710-11. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important
    to distinguish what is meant by the factual matrix from extrinsic evidence that
    is admissible to resolve an ambiguity. The factual matrix is gleaned from the
    context of the transaction. Doherty J.A. explained in <em>Dumbrell</em>, at
    para. 55, that the factual matrix “clearly extends to the genesis of the
    agreement, its purpose, and the commercial context in which the agreement was
    made”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the
    language of an insurance policy is found to be ambiguous, the court will rely
    on general rules of contract construction. As explained in <em>Progressive
    Homes</em>, at para. 23: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>For example, courts should prefer interpretations that are
    consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties (<em>Gibbens</em>,
    at para. 26; <em>Scalera</em>, at para. 71; <em>Consolidated-Bathurst</em>, at
    p. 901 [<em>Consolidated&#8209;Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and
    Machinery Insurance Co.</em>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888]), so long as such an
    interpretation can be supported by the text of the policy.&nbsp; Courts should
    avoid interpretations that would give rise to an unrealistic result or that
    would not have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the policy
    was concluded (<em>Scalera</em>, at para. 71; <em>Consolidated-Bathurst</em>,
    at p. 901). Courts should also strive to ensure that similar insurance policies
    are construed consistently (<em>Gibbens</em>, at para. 27). These rules of
    construction are applied to resolve ambiguity.&nbsp; They do not operate to
    create ambiguity where there is none in the first place.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Lombard
    Canada Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance Co</em>., 2010 ONCA 292, 101 O.R. (3d) 371, at
    para. 33, this court held that, where there is ambiguity in the sense that a
    phrase is capable of bearing two equally reasonable interpretations, the court
    may consider extrinsic evidence and the applicability of the <em>contra
    proferentem</em> rule.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    admission of extrinsic evidence does not mean that the parties’ subjective
    views of what was intended by the agreement will be used to resolve the ambiguity.
    On the contrary, the court should adopt the interpretation that gives effect to
    the reasonable expectations or intentions of the parties: <em>Scalera</em>, at
    para. 71; <em>Reid Crowther &amp; Partners Ltd. v. Simcoe &amp; Erie General

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn now to
    the arguments with respect to the interpretation of Endorsement #14 of the Onex

  <h3><span lang=X-NONE>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=X-NONE>Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American Home
    argues that the motion judge erred in finding that Endorsement #14 of the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy does not exclude coverage for the personal defendants’ claims
    for defence costs arising from the Georgia Action. According to American Home,
    under the plain meaning of Endorsement #14, the personal defendants’ losses in
    the form of defence costs fall into each of the following three exclusions in
    Endorsement #14:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(i)    the Georgia Action is a Claim made against Magnatrax or
    its Executives;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(ii)   the Georgia Action is a Claim brought by Magnatrax; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(iii) the Georgia Action is a Claim based on an act or omission
    of Magnatrax Executives.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning
    to the specific arguments, it is important to note that Endorsement #14 to the
    Onex 2002-2003 Policy is one part of an individually negotiated set of
    insurance arrangements between Onex, American Home and Magnatrax. Those
    arrangements resulted from a number of discussions and email exchanges. Those
    arrangements also included the issuance of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. The
    origin of those arrangements goes back to the discussions between the parties
    in January 2003 when Onex was contemplating a sale of Magnatrax. The parties
    added Endorsement #14 to the Onex 2002-2003 Policy as a result of a negotiated
    set of contractual arrangements.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, it is
    worth noting that the positions of both parties in approaching the
    interpretation dispute are commercially reasonable. Onex says that it is
    reasonable that Onex Executives would have wanted to maintain coverage under
    the more extensive Onex tower of insurance policies in the face of Magnatrax’s
    Chapter 11 filing and the heightened litigation risk associated with that
    filing.  American Home, on the other hand, says it would be reasonable for it
    to provide no more than one of its policy limits to respond to any “Claim”
    related to Magnatrax. Both of these positions are commercially reasonable when
    viewed from the parties’ own perspective.  Hence, the difficulty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We first explain
    why we would not give effect to American Home’s argument based on the second
    exclusion identified by American Home in Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003
    Policy. </p>
  <h6><span lang=X-NONE>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=X-NONE>The Georgia Action is a Claim Brought By Magnatrax</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American Home
    argues that the Loss arising from the Georgia Action is excluded by Endorsement
    #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy because the Loss arises out of or in
    connection with a Claim brought by Magnatrax. We repeat for convenience the
    language of the first paragraph of Endorsement #14 that relates to this
    argument:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he Insurer shall not be liable for any Loss... arising out
    of … or in connection with any Claim brought <em>by</em> … [Magnatrax]” …
    [Emphasis added.].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question
    then becomes whether the Georgia Action, which was brought by the Magnatrax
    Litigation Trust as plaintiff, and which asserts only causes of action assigned
    to it under the Magnatrax Plan of Reorganization, is a Claim brought by
    Magnatrax. If so, the Loss arising therefrom is excluded by Endorsement #14.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    set out the facts relevant to this argument at paras. 175-77 of his reported
    reasons. American Home does not dispute the motion judge’s summary of the
    facts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we said
    above, the Georgia Action was brought by the Trustee of the Magnatrax
    Litigation Trust. The Magnatrax Litigation Trust was established pursuant to s.
    4.21 of the Magnatrax Plan of Reorganization, which was approved by the U.S.
    Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 proceedings. It is clear, however, from both
    the Foley Letter and the complaint in the Georgia Action that the claims being
    advanced are claims which, up until their assignment to the Litigation Trust,
    belonged entirely to Magnatrax and its subsidiaries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Foley Letter
    requested immediate confirmation from Magnatrax and its subsidiaries in
    bankruptcy that it would pursue the claims identified against the entities and
    the individuals named, failing which it requested confirmation that the
    Creditors’ Committee could pursue the claims of Magnatrax on their behalf.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American Home
    argues that the motion judge erred in concluding that the Georgia Action was
    not brought by Magnatrax so as to come within the second exclusion in
    Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy. The Georgia Action is a derivative
    action instituted by the Litigation Trust and alleges causes of action
    originally belonging to Magnatrax. American Home correctly points out that if
    the Georgia Action had been brought by Magnatrax, it would be clear that
    Endorsement #14 would have excluded coverage.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American Home
    also points out that prior to the issuance of Endorsement #14, the exclusion in
    Endorsement #10 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, which amends clause 4(i) in that
    Policy, would have excluded coverage for proceedings – including derivative
    actions – commenced by a trustee established in bankruptcy proceedings of
    Magnatrax for the benefit of its creditors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exclusion in
    clause 4(i) of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy is a standard “Insured versus Insured”
    exclusion (see the Appendix for the text of clause 4(i)). This exclusion is
    designed to protect the insurer from having to provide coverage in relation to
    a legal proceeding by one insured party against another insured party. The
    “Insured versus Insured” exclusion is designed to prevent collusive proceedings
    whereby “an insured company might seek to force its insurer to pay for the poor
    business decisions of its officers or managers”: <em>Twp. Of Center, Butler
    County, Pa. v. First Mercury Syndicate, Inc.</em>, 117 F.3d 115, 119 (3d Cir.
    1997). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 3 of
    clause 4(i) provides that the Insured versus Insured exclusion “shall not apply
    to”:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) in any bankruptcy proceeding by or against an Organization,
    any Claim brought by the examiner, trustee, receiver, receiver manager,
    liquidator or rehabilitator (or any assignee thereof) of such Organization, if
    any;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Endorsement #10
    deleted subparagraph 3 of clause 4(i). Thus, the “Insured versus Insured”
    exclusion would apply to exclude coverage for a Claim brought in bankruptcy
    proceedings by a trustee of an Organization as defined in the Onex 2002-2003
    Policy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    effect of Endorsement #10 was removed insofar as Magnatrax was concerned after
    the parties agreed upon Endorsement #14. Endorsement #14 provides that
    Magnatrax is no longer a Subsidiary of Onex. “Organization” is defined to mean
    each “Subsidiary”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> American Home
    argues that there is no evidence that the parties intended that the amendments
    to the Onex 2002-2003 Policy resulting from the inclusion of Endorsement #14
    should operate to expose it to a form of coverage previously excluded –
    liability for derivative legal proceedings brought against Onex by a creditors’
    litigation trust.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    rejected these arguments. We agree with his conclusion and his reasons, at paras.
    178-80 of his reported reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Notwithstanding that the claims which are asserted against [the
    personal defendants] in the [Georgia Action] are derivative claims which
    initially belonged to Magnatrax and its subsidiaries, in my view, they are not
    brought by Magnatrax. The exclusion in the first paragraph of Endorsement #14
    of the [Onex 2002-2003 Policy] is clear. It applies to “any Claim brought by…”
    Magnatrax or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.  While [the Georgia Action]
    asserts claims which originally belonged to Magnatrax and its subsidiaries, it
    is brought by the Trustee on behalf of the Magnatrax Litigation Trust and not
    Magnatrax.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As noted earlier, exclusions are to be interpreted narrowly. 
    In the absence of more expansive wording in Endorsement #14 to exclude
    derivative claims, the words: “any Claim brought by or made against [Magnatrax,
    its subsidiaries and affiliates]” restrict the application of the exclusion to
    claims brought by Magnatrax, its subsidiaries and affiliates. As [the Georgia Action]
    is not such a Claim, Endorsement #14 does not exclude it from coverage.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nor, in my view, can American Home rely on Endorsement #10 of
    the [Onex 2002-2003 Policy] which excludes claims against any Insured where the
    claim is brought in any bankruptcy proceeding by or against an Organization
    when the claim is brought by, among others, the creditors’ committee or trust.
    Endorsement #14 removed Magnatrax as a subsidiary thereby excluding it from the
    definition of Organization under the [Onex 2002-2003 Policy].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To those
    reasons, we would add that the circumstances surrounding the adoption of
    Endorsement #14 support the motion judge’s interpretation of the words in that
    clause. The reason for the negotiations that resulted in Endorsement #14, as
    well as Endorsements #4 and #16 to the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy, was the
    impending bankruptcy of Magnatrax. Although these three endorsements were not,
    in fact, issued until sometime after the Chapter 11 proceedings involving
    Magnatrax had commenced, the endorsements were dated May 12, 2003 so as to
    coincide with the beginning of the Chapter 11 proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Endorsement #14
    had the effect of removing the bankruptcy exclusion in Endorsement #10 as it
    applied to Magnatrax. It is significant, we suggest, that the language in
    Endorsement #14 excludes coverage for Loss arising from a Claim brought by
    Magnatrax (the insolvent entity) but does not, as Endorsement #10 had, exclude
    Loss arising from a Claim brought by a trustee, a creditors’ committee, or a
    trust. We do not think that this omission, viewed objectively and reasonably,
    should be treated as an oversight, particularly when it is considered that
    Endorsement #14 was drafted in the circumstances of Magnatrax declaring
    bankruptcy. Rather, given the experience and sophistication of the parties, we
    conclude, as the motion judge did, that the parties intended the exclusion in
    Endorsement #14 to apply only to Loss arising from a Claim brought by
    Magnatrax. Had the parties intended that the exclusion was to apply to Loss arising
    from a Claim brought by assignees, trustees, or other representatives asserting
    Magnatrax’s claims, they would have specifically said so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American Home
    argues that the defence costs claimed by the personal defendants are excluded
    from coverage by two additional exclusions in Endorsement #14 of the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy: the remaining language in the first paragraph of Endorsement
    #14 and the second sentence of the second paragraph of Endorsement #14. We
    repeat the relevant language for convenience: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In consideration of the premium charged, it is hereby
    understood and agreed that <em>the Insurer shall not be liable for any Loss
    alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to or in connection with

    any </em>[Executive]<em> thereof.</em> </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Further, the Insurer shall not be liable to make any payment

    out of, based upon or attributable to any breach of duty, act, error or

    board of managers or employee thereof. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    did not accept American Home’s arguments based on either the first or second
    paragraphs of Endorsement #14. He concluded, at para. 169 of his reported
    reasons, that although Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy is an
    exclusion provision, it does not operate as an “absolute” exclusion in respect
    of all claims against Onex’s directors and officers relating to Magnatrax. He concluded
    that the language of Endorsement #14 was unambiguous and thus only open to the
    interpretation he adopted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have
    considered the language of Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy in the
    context of the surrounding circumstances or the factual matrix.  In our view,
    the language viewed in that context is ambiguous.  It is open to two reasonable
    interpretations: the one urged by American Home and the one adopted by the
    motion judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because there is
    ambiguity, it becomes necessary to turn to extrinsic evidence to assist with
    the interpretative exercise.  Before turning to the use of extrinsic evidence,
    we will set out why we consider both of the competing interpretations to be
    reasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We start with
    the motion judge’s interpretation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the motion
    judge’s view, Endorsement #14 excludes coverage for claims against the personal
    defendants acting in their capacity as Magnatrax Executives, but it does not
    exclude from coverage claims against the personal defendants acting in their
    capacity as Onex Executives. The motion judge drew the distinction between the
    capacity in which the personal defendants were acting at para. 105 of his
    reported reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Further, based on a review of the entire Complaint in the
    [Georgia] Action and in particular the allegations against [the personal
    defendants], it is my view that the claims against the [personal defendants]
    are asserted against them in their capacity both as directors and officers of
    Onex and as directors (or de facto directors…) and officers of Magnatrax. <em>The
    overarching theme of the Complaint </em>[i.e., the Georgia Action]<em> is that
    Onex, as directed by the [personal defendants] in their capacity as Onex
    directors and officers, engineered the demise of Magnatrax and its subsidiaries
    for their collective benefit. </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    went on, at paras. 173-74, to interpret the exclusionary effect of Endorsement
    #14 as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Accordingly, when read in its entirety, Endorsement #14
    operates to remove Magnatrax (and any subsidiary or affiliate) from coverage
    under the [Onex 2002-2003 Policy] and exclude any claim against Onex directors
    and officers by or against Magnatrax or arising out of, based upon or
    attributable to any act on the part of Magnatrax or its directors and officers.
    What Endorsement #14 does not exclude, in my view, is any claim by a third
    party against Onex’s directors and officers in their capacity as such for their
    wrongful acts in relation to Magnatrax.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Based on the above interpretation of Endorsement #14, it is my
    view that the [Georgia] Action is not excluded from coverage under the [Onex
    2002-2003 Policy]. As has been previously discussed, the [Georgia] Action
    asserts claims against the [personal defendants] in their capacity as directors
    and/or officers of Onex relating to Magnatrax. The claims are not based upon or
    attributable to any act on the part of Magnatrax or its directors and officers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    elaborated on his understanding of the term “Claim” in the Magnatrax Run-Off
    Policy and the Onex 2002-2003 Policy at paras. 54-55 of his unreported January
    20, 2012 reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The term “Claim” is broadly defined in both the Magnatrax
    [Run-Off] Policy and the [Onex 2002-2003 Policy] to include, among other
    things, a written demand for monetary, non-monetary or injunctive relief as
    well as [a] civil proceeding for monetary, non-monetary or injunctive relief
    commenced by statement of claim. It is intended to define a triggering event in
    respect of coverage under the Policies. In my view, however, based on the
    wording of the Policies as a whole, the definition of Claim is broad enough to
    also encompass multiple individual claims within an action or proceeding as
    well. It is not restricted to mean solely an action or proceeding.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To define Claim as being limited to a legal action or
    proceeding makes no sense having regard to the wording of the Policies. The
    Policies refer to and deal with actions or proceedings which assert multiple
    claims where some of the claims are covered and some are not. They also provide
    for claims against insured in actions where there are co-defendants who are not
    covered. It is the covered claims within an action or proceeding that are
    covered rather than the entire action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These reasons
    indicate that the motion judge was satisfied that the Georgia Action advanced
    claims against the personal defendants both in their capacities as Executives
    of Magnatrax and in their capacities as Executives of Onex. American Home does
    not challenge this finding on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also
    apparent that the motion judge was satisfied that while the term “Claim” as it
    is defined in the Onex 2002-2003 Policy refers to a civil proceeding, the term
    need not necessarily encompass the entirety of the civil proceeding. According
    to the motion judge, when the wording of the policies is looked at as a whole:
    “the definition of Claim is broad enough to also encompass multiple individual
    claims within an action or proceeding as well. It is not restricted to mean
    solely an action or proceeding”: unreported reasons, at para. 54.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We think that the
    motion judge’s view is tenable to the following extent.  We agree that when the
    wording of the policies is looked at as a whole, it is reasonable to interpret
    the term “Claim” in Endorsement #14 as not necessarily referring to the
    entirety of a proceeding. The phrase in the first paragraph of Endorsement #14
    – “any Claim … made against [Magnatrax or its Executives]” – can be taken as
    referring to the Georgia Action as advanced against Magnatrax or its
    Executives, and not as referring to the Georgia Action as advanced against Onex
    or its Executives acting in their capacity as such.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following
    wording of the policies supports this view. Under the terms of the Executive
    Liability coverage in the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, American Home was responsible
    to pay the Loss of an Onex Executive arising from a Claim made against the
    Executive for any “Wrongful Act” of the Executive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Wrongful Act”
    is defined as meaning: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)     any
    actual or alleged breach of duty, neglect, error, misstatement, misleading
    statement, omission or act…</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(i) with respect to any Executive of an Organization, by
    such Executive in his or her capacity as such or any matter claimed against
    such Executive solely by reason of his or her status as such;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apparent
    from this definition that the capacity in which an Executive is acting when
    committing a Wrongful Act is a crucial feature of coverage. It is only when
    acting in his or her capacity as an Executive of the covered Organization that
    the Executive is covered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the
    Magnatrax Run-Off Policy was issued and Magnatrax and Magnatrax Executives were
    removed from coverage under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, it would be reasonable
    to interpret these policies as providing that Magnatrax Executives would no
    longer be covered under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy for a Claim brought against
    them in their capacity as Magnatrax Executives, but that Onex Executives would
    continue to be covered under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy for Wrongful Acts
    committed by them in their capacity as Onex Executives. In other words, it is
    reasonable to interpret the term “Claim” in Endorsement #14 as referring to a
    proceeding against a particular Insured acting in the capacity that attracts
    coverage. Considered in this light, the wording of the first paragraph of
    Endorsement #14 – “the Insurer shall not be liable for any Loss… arising out
    of… any Claim… made against [Magnatrax or its Executives]” – could reasonably
    mean a Claim to the extent that it is advanced against Magnatrax or its
    Executives in their capacity as such. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this interpretation
    of the phrase “any Claim”, the exclusion in the second paragraph of Endorsement
    #14 could reasonably be interpreted as not excluding all of the defence costs
    of the Georgia Action from coverage. If a proceeding (in this case a civil
    action) includes causes of action against an Insured acting in more than one
    capacity, it would be necessary to separate the claims based upon the
    capacities in which the Insured is being sued and to then determine whether or
    not the Insured is covered or excluded under the provisions of the policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case,
    the motion judge found, at para. 105 of his reported reasons, that “[t]he
    overarching theme of the Complaint [<em>i.e.</em>, the Georgia Action] is that
    Onex, as directed by the [personal defendants] in their capacity as Onex
    directors and officers, engineered the demise of Magnatrax and its subsidiaries
    for their collective benefit.” At para. 174 of his reported reasons, he held
    that at least some of the claims were advanced against the personal defendants
    “in their capacity as directors and/or officers of Onex” and are not “based
    upon or attributable to any act on the part of Magnatrax or its directors and
    officers.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At least with
    respect to the unjust enrichment claim, we agree with the motion judge’s
    characterization. This claim is not “alleging, arising out of, based upon or
    attributable to any breach of duty, act, error or omission of Magnatrax [or any
    Magnatrax Executive]”. On this view, it would be reasonable to interpret the
    second paragraph of Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy as not
    excluding the cost of defending the unjust enrichment aspect of the Georgia
    Action. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having said
    that, we are not prepared to find that the motion judge’s interpretation of
    Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy is the only reasonably available
    interpretation. We find that American Home’s suggested interpretations of the
    first paragraph of Endorsement #14 and of the second paragraph of Endorsement
    #14 are also reasonable ones. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In advancing the
    argument based on the exclusion in the first paragraph of Endorsement #14,
    American Home’s fundamental position is that the word “Claim” in this clause
    should be read as it is defined in the Onex 2002-2003 Policy. The definition of
    “Claim” states: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>“Claim” means: </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2) a civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or arbitration
    proceeding for monetary, non-monetary or injunctive relief which is commenced
    by:  (i) service of a Writ of Summons, Statement of Claim or similar
    originating legal document; (ii) return of a summons, information, indictment
    or similar document (in the case of a criminal proceeding); or (iii) receipt or
    filing of a notice of charges;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the
    definition of the term “Claim” as a civil proceeding, American Home contends
    that the first paragraph of Endorsement #14 clearly excludes the personal
    defendants’ defence costs from coverage for two main reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the
    personal defendants’ defence costs constitute Loss arising out of, attributable
    to or in connection with “a civil proceeding”, namely, the Georgia Action.
    Second, the Georgia Action is a civil proceeding against Magnatrax Executives,
    who were named as individual defendants in the Georgia Action. Thus, on a plain
    reading of the first paragraph of Endorsement #14, the personal defendants’ Loss
    in the form of defence costs arising from the Georgia Action is excluded from
    coverage.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    American Home’s argument based on the second paragraph of Endorsement #14 is
    that this language operates to exclude coverage for Loss in connection with any
    civil proceeding against Onex Executives alleging, arising out of, based upon
    or attributable to the conduct of Magnatrax Executives. The Georgia Action
    includes allegations of wrongful acts committed by directors and officers of
    both Magnatrax and Onex. Thus, the argument goes, the Georgia Action is a
    “Claim” – that is, a civil proceeding – arising out of acts by Magnatrax
    Executives. That being the case, the defence costs associated with the Georgia
    Action are excluded from coverage by the above-quoted language from the second
    paragraph of Endorsement #14. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On American
    Home’s interpretation, there is no basis in the language of Endorsement #14 or
    elsewhere in the policy language for assigning a different meaning to the term
    “Claim” than is provided by the definition in the policy. American Home argues
    that giving a different meaning to the term “Claim” as it appears in
    Endorsement #14 would deviate from the meaning of the term most commonly used
    in the D&amp;O insurance industry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with
    American Home to the extent that we conclude that it is reasonable to interpret
    the term “Claim” in Endorsement #14 in the way the term is defined in the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy, namely, as a civil proceeding. On one reading of the first
    paragraph of Endorsement #14, the Georgia Action constitutes a civil proceeding
    brought against Magnatrax Executives, and the Insurer is not liable for “any
    Loss” in connection with this Claim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that it
    is also reasonable to interpret the second paragraph of Endorsement #14 as excluding
    coverage for the claimed defence costs because these costs arise from a Claim
    that is based on acts or omissions of Magnatrax Executives. Each of the four
    counts in the Georgia Action against the individual defendants name both the
    personal defendants who served as Onex Executives (<em>i.e.</em>, Schwartz,
    Govan, Wright and Hilson), as well as two individual defendants who only served
    as Magnatrax Executives (<em>i.e.</em>, Richard T. Ammerman and Raymond C.
    Blackmon Jr.). The language of the second paragraph of Endorsement #14 can be
    read to exclude from coverage the costs of defending the Georgia Action because
    these costs constitute Loss in connection with a Claim alleging, arising out
    of, based upon or attributable to the conduct of Magnatrax Executives (<em>i.e.</em>,
    Wright, Hilson, Ammerman and Blackmon).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the
    reasonableness of the competing interpretations of the term “Claim” in
    Endorsement #14, it is necessary to consider if each interpretation is consistent
    with the use of that term elsewhere in the Onex 2002-2003 Policy. We have
    reviewed the language of the policy, and in particular have examined
    Endorsements #5 and #9. American Home contended that the language of these
    endorsements supports its interpretation of Endorsement #14.  We conclude that
    the way the term “Claim” is used elsewhere in the policy does not assist in
    determining which interpretation of the use of that term in Endorsement #14 is
    the correct one.  There are reasonable arguments pointing in both directions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have also
    considered the factual matrix in this case, which is set out above in paras.
    25-48 above.  As we see it, plausible arguments can be made on both sides as to
    the reasonableness of either interpretation in view of the surrounding
    circumstances, the provisions of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy and when viewed
    objectively, what the parties to the negotiations would have been trying to
    accomplish.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching the
    conclusion that Endorsement #14 is ambiguous, we have specifically considered
    Endorsements #16 and #4 to the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy (see paras. 43 and 44
    above).  In our view, these endorsements can be interpreted to sit comfortably
    with American Home’s interpretation of Endorsement #14 in the Onex 2002-2003
    Policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using the plain
    meaning of the definitions provided in the policies, under American Home's
    interpretation of Endorsement #14 in the Onex 2002-2003 Policy and Endorsement
    #16 in the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy, coverage is not simultaneously available
    under the two policies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to
    American Home, Endorsement #4 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy would afford
    coverage with respect to any civil proceeding against Onex or Onex Executives
    provided that the civil proceeding relates to a Wrongful Act committed by
    Magnatrax or a Magnatrax Executive if either Magnatrax or a Magnatrax Executive
    remains as a defendant in the civil proceeding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, we do
    not think that the compatibility of Endorsements #16 and #4 of the Magnatrax
    Run-Off Policy with American Home’s interpretation of Endorsement #14 in the
    Onex 2002-2003 Policy is determinative of the interpretation exercise.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a starting
    point, American Home’s interpretation of these paragraphs in Endorsement #14 of
    the Onex 2002-2003 Policy leaves a potential gap in coverage for Onex
    Executives. On American Home’s interpretation, Onex Executives would be covered
    by the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy for their Wrongful Acts in relation to
    Magnatrax provided they were sued along with Magnatrax or a Magnatrax
    Executive. However, they would not be afforded coverage under either policy if
    they were sued on their own in their capacity as Onex Executives for the same
    Wrongful Acts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    Endorsement #16 also can be read in a manner that is consistent with the motion
    judge’s interpretation of Endorsement #14 to the Onex 2002-2003 Policy.  If
    “Claim” as it appears in Endorsement #14 to the Onex 2002-2003 Policy is
    interpreted as meaning the Georgia Action as advanced against Magnatrax or its
    Executives, and not as referring to the Georgia Action as advanced against Onex
    or its Executives acting in their capacity as such, the coverage afforded to
    Magnatrax Executives under the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy would not trigger
    Endorsement #16 to the Magnatrax Run-off Policy. Similarly, aspects of the
    Georgia Action advanced against Onex Executives that do not attract coverage
    under Endorsement #4 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy would not trigger
    Endorsement #16 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. Viewed in this way,
    Endorsement #16 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy does not make the motion judge’s
    interpretation of Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy unreasonable.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Endorsement #4
    of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy may sit less comfortably with the motion
    judge’s interpretation of Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy.
    Arguably, the motion judge’s interpretation avoids the potential for a gap in
    coverage if a civil proceeding involving Magnatrax named only Onex and Onex
    Executives as defendants and did not name as defendants Magnatrax or any
    individuals who served as Magnatrax Executives.  That said, it is not entirely
    clear what effect such an interpretation would have on the coordination of
    liability limits under Endorsement #16 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view,
    however, the difficulty in reconciling the two endorsements from the Magnatrax
    Run-Off Policy with the motion judge’s interpretation of Endorsement #14 of the
    Onex 2002-2003 Policy does not determine the interpretative exercise. We have
    concluded that the ambiguity, as discussed above in these reasons, remains. The
    factual matrix in this case does not resolve which interpretation of
    Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy reflects the parties’ reasonable
    expectations or intentions in putting in place the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy and
    amending the Onex 2002-2003 Policy by adding Endorsement #14.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each party
    advanced an interpretation of Endorsement #14 reflecting their reasonable
    expectation of coverage. Viewed objectively, either interpretation of
    Endorsement #14 would produce a commercially sensible result.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, we
    are of the view that the wording of Endorsement #14 in the Onex 2002-2003
    Policy is susceptible of more than one meaning and is therefore ambiguous.
    Accordingly, we do not agree with the motion judge’s conclusion at para. 169 of
    his reported reasons that the wording of Endorsement #14 is clear and
    unambiguous.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an
    ambiguity is first identified on appeal, it must be asked if the appellate
    court is in a position to resolve the ambiguity <em>de novo</em>. Section
    134(1) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, empowers
    this court to make any order that the motion judge could have made. The parties
    brought competing motions to decide the personal defendants’ action by way of
    summary judgment. The evidentiary record from the motions was filed
    electronically in this court with leave.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The governing
    test for assessing if it is appropriate to exercise the powers conferred by
    rule 20.01(2.1) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    194, on a motion for summary judgment is the full appreciation test from <em>Combined
    Air Mechanical v. Flesch</em>, 2011 ONCA 764, 108 O.R. (3d) 1. This court
    described the test as follows, at para. 50: “can the full appreciation of the
    evidence and issues that is required to make dispositive findings be achieved by
    way of summary judgment, or can this full appreciation only be achieved by way
    of a trial?” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have examined
    the record carefully.  Regrettably, we find that we are not in a position to
    decide the factual issues that need to be determined in order to resolve the
    interpretative dispute. Having found that Endorsement #14 was unambiguous, the
    motion judge did not make findings of fact with respect to the issues we
    consider relevant to the resolution of the interpretation exercise. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In arguing the
    appeal, the parties each took the position that the interpretation they urged
    on the court was unambiguous. That being the case, they paid little attention
    to the issues that we now find must be determined – what were the reasonable
    expectations or intentions of the parties in adopting Endorsement #14 of the
    Onex 2002-2003 Policy? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the
    disposition we would make of this appeal, we will not express an opinion on the
    body of evidence that may be relevant to determining that issue. Suffice it to
    say that there is evidence of discussions and correspondence that took place in
    January 2003 and again at the time of the issuance of the Magnatrax Run-Off
    Policy and the issuance of Endorsement #14.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that it
    will be open to the Superior Court to decide, if need be, whether Endorsement
    #16 of the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy entitles American Home to set-off amounts
    that may be found owing under the Onex 2002-2003 Policy against payments made
    under the Magnatrax Run-Off Policy. </p>

    Onex subsidiary on November 17, 2003, which was the date the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Court approved the Magnatrax Plan of Reorganization.  In their appeal facta,
    the parties suggest different dates for when Magnatrax ceased to be an Onex
    subsidiary. Onex and the Excess Insurers indicate that Magnatrax ceased to be
    an Onex subsidiary when it emerged from Chapter 11 protection on January 20,
    2004, whereas American Home indicates that Magnatrax ceased to be an Onex subsidiary
    when it declared bankruptcy, which was May 12, 2003. We need not resolve this
    issue because Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy provides that the
    definition of subsidiary shall not include Magnatrax Corporation as of May 12,
    2003, which is the date that Endorsement #14 became effective and is the
