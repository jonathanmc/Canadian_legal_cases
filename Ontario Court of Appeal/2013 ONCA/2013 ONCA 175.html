  <p class=Heard>Heard: March 15, 2013</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice P. Kane
    of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on March 3, 2011 and the
    sentence imposed by Justice Kane on September 9, 2011.</p>
  <p class=Judge>BY THE COURT:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks to set aside his conviction by a jury of sexual
    assault on the ground that he was not tried in a reasonable time as required by
    s. 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>.  He also seeks leave to appeal from the trial
    judges order that he pay a victim surcharge of $4,000.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offence of which the appellant was convicted is alleged to have
    taken place in the early morning of July 15, 2007 in the basement of the appellants
    home at CFB Petawawa. The appellant was then a member of the Canadian Forces.
    The complainant was a civilian, a long-time friend of the appellants partner
    and of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant reported her allegations to military authorities the
    next day and military police commenced an investigation. In accordance with the
    procedure followed in the military, the appellant was arrested, but not charged
    with an offence, on July 24, 2007. He was released on condition that he remain
    in Canada under military authority and not communicate with or be within 500
    meters of the complaint. He continued to perform his duties with the Canadian
    Forces.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 10, 2008, after the military investigation had been completed
    and reviewed by the military prosecution authorities, the appellant was served
    with a Record of Disciplinary Proceedings (RDP), the charging document in
    military prosecutions. About two weeks later, a decision of the Court Martial
    Appeal Court effectively shut down the then existing system of military
    prosecutions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Regional Military Prosecutor met with the local Crown Attorney about
    the appellants case and others. The Crown Attorney agreed to assume
    responsibility for the appellants prosecution in the civilian justice system.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 6, 2008 an information was laid against the appellant
    charging him with the sexual assault of which he was ultimately convicted.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Committal for Trial</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 9, 2009, about eight months after he was charged with the
    offence in proceedings instituted in the civilian justice system, the appellant
    was ordered to stand trial at the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Proceedings in the Superior Court</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeared in an Assignment Court in the Superior Court of
    Justice on September 14, 2009. A pre-trial conference was scheduled for October
    7, 2009. For reasons that are not material, the pre-trial conference was
    rescheduled for December 10, 2009.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 11, 2010, the appellant appeared in another Assignment Court
    in the Superior Court of Justice to set a date for trial. His [then] counsel
    advised the presiding judge that he had several pre-trial motions, including an
    application to stay proceedings under s. 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. Counsel
    told the presiding judge that he (counsel) was not available to argue the
    motions, which he estimated would take three days, until October, 2010. He
    sought a trial date of December 6, 2010, nearly 11 months after the  Assignment
    Court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judge presiding in the Assignment Court refused to schedule the pre-trial
    motions and trial as proposed by the appellants [then] counsel. The appellant
    was required to get new counsel, another lawyer in the same office, and August
    3, 2010 was fixed as the date for trial.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The New Trial Date</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Towards
    the end of July 2010, the Crown Attorney learned that no jury panel had been
    summoned for the week of August 3, when the appellants trial was to take
    place. The Crown Attorney notified counsel for the appellant and offered his (the
    Crown Attorneys) consent to a re-election of trial before a judge sitting without
    a jury. The appellant declined the offer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 3, 2010, trial dates were offered to the appellant beginning in late
    September, 2010 and continuing throughout the fall and into the winter.  Except
    for one week in December when the Crown Attorney was not available, defence
    counsel was not available until February 28, 2011. The presiding judge fixed
    February 28, 2011 as the date for trial. The jury returned their verdict on
    March 3, 2011.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Sentencing Proceedings</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    permit preparation of a pre-sentence report in New Brunswick where the
    appellant was then living, sentencing proceedings were adjourned to June 29,
    2011. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pre-sentence reported was received on June 29, 2011, but the sentencing did not
    proceed on that date because the trial judge was unavailable.  He was in
    another jurisdiction awaiting the verdict of a deliberating jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge imposed sentence, including a $4,000 victim surcharge on September
    9, 2011.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    his appeal from conviction, the appellant contends that the judge who heard the
    two s. 11(b) motions in advance of trial (the motion judge) erred by </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i.        mischaracterizing
    the delay prior to April 10, 2008;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii.       mischaracterizing
    the delay after August 3, 2010, the first trial   date; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>iii.      failing
    to enter a stay of proceedings even if he had properly      characterized the
    periods of and responsibility for the delay.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The appellant also contends that the additional delay
    caused by the time that elapsed in concluding sentencing proceedings breached
    ss. 7 and 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to any of the alleged errors in connection with
    s.&nbsp;11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=Heading>DISCUSSION</p>
  <p class=Heading>          The Delay Prior to April 10, 2008</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the motion judge erred in law in determining that the
    starting date for the purpose of the delay analysis under s. 11(b) was April
    10, 2008, the day he was served with the RDP, the charging document in the
    military prosecution. The appellant says that the starting date for s. 11(b)
    purposes should have been either </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i.        the
    date of his arrest without charge and release subject to        conditions,
    July 24, 2007; or</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii.       at
    the latest, the date upon which DNA results were received     by the
    authorities, January 30, 2008.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well-settled that a person is charged with an offence within s. 11, thus
    s. 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>, when an information is sworn alleging an
    offence against him or her: <em>R. v. Kalanj</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1594, at p.
    1607. Time reckoning for the purposes of claims of infringement of the right to
    be tried within a reasonable time commences with the laying of the information
    and continues until the completion of the trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judges assessment of the appellants claim under s. 11(b) proceeds from
    the starting date of April 10, 2008, the day upon which the appellant was
    charged with an offence in the system of military justice then in force. It
    may well be open to question whether the commencement date should have been
    nearly seven months later, on November 6, 2008, when the appellant was charged
    with the offence in the civilian courts before which he was ultimately tried. 
    But that issue we leave for another day.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that the appellant invites us to consider pre-charge delay as
    relevant to the s. 11(b) analysis, we decline to do so.  Pre-charge delay is
    not counted in determining the length of the delay for the purposes of the
    analysis under s. 11(b).  The reason is simple: prior to charge, an accused has
    not been charged with an offence as required by the opening words of s. 11 of
    the <em>Charter</em>: <em>Kalanj</em>, at p. 1610. But in some circumstances,
    pre-charge delay may have an influence on the overall determination of whether
    post-charge delay is unreasonable: <em>R. v. Morin</em>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771,
    at p. 789.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that this is one of those cases in which the period preceding
    the laying of the charge, whichever date is appropriate for the s. 11(b) analysis,
    has any influence on the overall determination of whether the post-charge delay
    was unreasonable. Pre-charge delay did not infringe the appellants right to
    security of the person, or his liberty interest, or compromise his right to
    make full answer and defence.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Post August 3, 2010 Delay</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also contends that the motion judge erred in his characterization of
    the period following the first trial date of August 3, 2010 in his s. 11(b)
    analysis.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    we disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the Crown Attorney learned in late July, 2010 that no jury panel had been
    summoned for the appellants trial to begin on August 3, 2010, he immediately notified
    counsel for the appellant. The Crown Attorney offered to consent to a
    re-election to trial by a judge sitting without a jury but the appellant, as
    was his undoubted right, declined to re-elect his mode of trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was offered trial dates beginning in late September, 2010, a matter
    of weeks after the first scheduled trial date. Apart from one week in December
    when the Crown Attorney was not available, counsel for the appellant was not
    available until late February, 2011. The motion judge did not consider that the
    entire seven-month period between the trial dates should be characterized as
    institutional or Crown delay, but he did not assign specific periods to the
    various participants.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the motion judges approach to this time period did not cause any
    prejudice to the appellant. While defence counsel is not expected to hold him
    or herself in a state of perpetual readiness after a trial does not proceed on
    a scheduled date, on any reasonable view, a significant period of time between
    trial dates was rightly assigned to neutral delay.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Delay in Sentencing</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that the delay in completing sentencing proceedings, in
    particular, the delay between the original and actual sentencing dates, should
    be counted in the total period of delay and result in a stay of proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the date fixed for sentencing, the trial judge was unavailable because, as a
    member of an itinerant court, he was sitting in another jurisdiction awaiting
    the verdict of a jury. As this court noted in another context in <em>R. v.
    Meisner</em>, [2004] O.J. No. 3802, at para. 3, things happen from time to time
    in the criminal justice system for which no one can be faulted and which
    inevitably require an adjournment. Inherent in the process is that time is
    required to reschedule the adjourned proceedings. That happened here. The accommodation
    was reasonable, the delay neutral for the purposes of the s. 11(b) assessment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also alleges error in the imposition of a victim surcharge of $4,000
    as part of the sentence imposed upon him. The respondent takes the position
    that a reduction in the amount of the victim surcharge would not be contrary to
    the interests of justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    obligation to impose a victim surcharge on a convicted offender, except where the
    offender establishes undue hardship to him or her or his or her dependants, is
    created by s. 737(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The general rule about
    quantum, in circumstances such as these, is that the amount of the victim
    surcharge is to be $100. This amount may be increased where an increase is
    appropriate in the circumstances and the offender is able to pay a higher
    amount.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the trial judge had imposed sentence, including ancillary DNA collection and
    SOIRA orders, the court clerk asked whether a victim fine surcharge was being
    imposed. During the brief discussion that followed, the trial Crown (not Ms.
    Shai) suggested that the surcharge should be fixed in an amount towards the
    upper end of a range of $1,000 to $5,000.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, Crown counsel takes the position that a reduction in the amount of the
    victim surcharge would not be contrary to the interests of justice.  We agree.
    The trial record reveals no basis upon which the trial judge could conclude
    that such a departure from the statutory minimum victim surcharge was
    appropriate in the circumstances of this case. Nor was any meaningful inquiry
    conducted about the ability of the appellant to pay the amount of victim
    surcharge that was imposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we grant leave to appeal sentence and allow the appeal from
    sentence to the extent of reducing the victim surcharge from $4,000 to $100 in
    accordance with the provisions of s. 737(2)(b)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</p>
