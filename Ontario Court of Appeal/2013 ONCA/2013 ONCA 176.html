    with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Laskin
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant, M.H., alleged that the appellant, S.L., took her out in
    his car and had sex with her.  She was 15 and he was 33.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with sexual interference, invitation to sexual
    touching, and sexual assault.  He did not testify or call a defence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After an eight-day jury trial, the appellant was convicted of sexual
    interference but acquitted of invitation to sexual touching and sexual
    assault.  After credit of ten months for pre-sentence custody, he was sentenced
    to three years in jail.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual interference and asks
    for an acquittal.  He contends that the conviction was unreasonable on the
    basis that it is inconsistent with the two acquittals.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a jury trial on a multi-count indictment against a single accused, a
    claim of inconsistent verdicts turns on the question whether the verdicts are
    supportable on any theory of the evidence consistent with the trial judges
    proper legal instructions:  see <em>R. v. J.F.</em>, 2008 SCC 60, [2008] 3
    S.C.R. 215, at para. 23; <em>R. v. Pittiman</em>, 2006 SCC 9, [2006] 1 S.C.R.
    381, at para. 7. Here, the verdicts will be supportable if the trial judges
    instructions were proper legal instructions that could have led the jury to
    accept a theory of the evidence producing these verdicts.<span
style='background:yellow'> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the verdicts are not supportable.  He argues
    that because of the complainants age, there was no meaningful difference
    between the elements of the three offences.  Thus, the jury should have either
    convicted or acquitted the appellant of all three charges.  The split verdict
    was not one a properly instructed trier of fact could reasonably have
    rendered.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the verdicts are supportable because the jury was
    told to consider each count separately; and because it was told that sexual
    assault required an application of force, but that sexual interference required
    no use of force, only intentional touching.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To put these submissions in context, I will briefly review the facts
    giving rise to the charges against the appellant.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>backgrouNd facts</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant M.H.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.H. was 15 years old in July 2010, when the offences were alleged to
    have occurred.  Her mother and the appellant were close friends.  The appellant
    had known her since she was in grade six.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.H.
    had a difficult upbringing because of her mothers substance abuse.  She was
    made a ward of the Childrens Aid Society and placed with her aunt and uncle. 
    She fought with them frequently and either ran away or was asked to leave their
    home several times.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The incident</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early July, M.H. had a fight with her aunt and uncle and left their house to
    stay with friends.  On July 9 at about 10:00 p.m., she went to her
    grandmothers home.  Her grandmother called M.H.s mother, who picked M.H. up
    in a taxi and took her to the appellants apartment.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    few hours later, M.H. went to sleep in the appellants bedroom.  She awoke between
    3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.  Her mother was in the bed beside her talking to the
    appellant.  M.H. said that she was thirsty.  Her mother told her that the
    appellant would get her a drink.  M.H. went to the kitchen with the appellant
    to get a glass of water.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to M.H., the appellant then suggested that the two of them go somewhere.  He
    told M.H.s mother that they were going to do a run, which M.H. understood as
    a trip to buy drugs.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.H.
    testified that they got into the appellants car and started driving around.  The
    appellant took M.H. to an empty parking lot behind a building near his
    apartment.  He parked the car and told M.H. to get in the backseat, which she
    did.  He got in the backseat too.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then pulled down his pants and told M.H. to take off her pants.  She
    did so.  She removed her jogging pants and the bathing suit bottoms she was
    wearing.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.H.
    testified that the appellant asked her to give him a blow job.  She complied. 
    After the oral sex, the appellant told her to get on top of him.  She did. They
    began to have vaginal intercourse. After some time, the appellant told M.H. to
    lay down on the seat so he could continue to have vaginal intercourse with
    her.  Again, she complied.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    had vaginal intercourse with her for not that long.  M.H. thought that he
    ejaculated.  He did not use a condom.  She never said no or stop.  She
    agreed that the appellant did not threaten her with violence or use any kind of
    physical coercion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the intercourse, the appellant gave M.H. a wet wipe.  She cleaned off her
    vaginal area and threw the tissue out of the car.  The appellant told her not
    to tell her mother what they had done.  He gave M.H. some weed so it would
    appear that they went on a drug run.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    drove back to the appellants apartment, and M.H. went back to bed.  The next
    morning the appellant sat beside M.H. on the couch, touched her leg, and told
    her its our secret.  M.H. testified that the appellant threatened he would
    cut her up if she told anyone.  She said she would not tell.  He gave her some
    money and jewellery and drove her and her mother to a bus stop.  </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The forensic evidence</h2>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Examination of the complainant</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    day after the incident M.H. confided in a friend.  The friend told her mother,
    and her mother told M.H.s aunt and uncle.  M.H.s aunt then contacted the
    police.  M.H. gave a statement and was taken for an examination.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    examination showed no injuries, and vaginal swabs did not detect any
    spermatozoa.  The expert forensic analyst testified that it was less likely
    sperm would be detectable on an internal swab taken two days after sexual
    activity.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discarded tissue</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police took M.H. to locate the scene of the incident.  She was able to identify
    the parking lot where the appellant had taken her.  At the parking lot, she
    spotted what she believed to be the tissue she had discarded after the
    incident.  The tissue was analysed, and no semen was detected on it.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DNA evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    days after the incident, the police seized the jogging pants M.H. had worn that
    night.  They were tested for sperm.  The initial screening tests were positive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    sample areas  the front-centre-right of the crotch panel and the back-right of
    the crotch panel  were submitted for further testing.  On a second screening,
    these two samples also tested positive.  Although no spermatozoa could be seen
    under a microscope, the analyst testified that in her opinion the fluid on the
    pants was most likely semen.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant matched the major DNA profile found in both the front and back panel
    of the inside crotch of the complainants jogging pants.  The probability that
    a random person had contributed the DNA that matched the appellant was 1 in 7.4
    billion (back panel) and 1 in 21 trillion (front panel).  </p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence challenged the credibility and reliability of M.H.s evidence, and
    argued that the forensic evidence did not support the charges.  </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants simple, yet powerful proposition is that he was both convicted and
    acquitted by the same jury for a single act committed against the same
    person.  His proposition seemingly has merit:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The three offences refer to a single instance of sexual activity

    minutes;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The allegations against the appellant depended on the credibility
    of a single witness: the complainant; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence led by the Crown on the three counts was identical.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the elements of the three offences were virtually identical.  The trial judges
    instructions on what the jury had to find to convict on each offence may be
    summarized as follows.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sexual interference (s. 151 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>):</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That M.H. was under 16;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          That the appellant touched M.H.; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>          That the touching was for a sexual
    purpose.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Invitation to sexual touching (s. 152 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>):</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That M.H. was under 16;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That the appellant invited M.H. to touch his body; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That the touching the appellant invited was for a sexual
    purpose.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sexual assault (s. 271 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>):</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That the appellant intentionally applied forced to M.H.; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That the application of force, even an intentional touching,
    occurred in circumstances of a sexual nature.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.H.s
    age was admitted; the appellant did not claim that he was reasonably mistaken
    about her age; and as M.H. was under 16, she could not in law consent to the
    sexual activity.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the appellant contends that he should either have been convicted or acquitted
    of all three offences  convicted if the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the incident M.H. recounted took place and acquitted if the jury had
    a reasonable doubt about whether the incident took place.  The verdicts the
    jury did render, the appellant says, cannot be reconciled.  The conviction for
    sexual interference is inconsistent and therefore unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    attractive as the appellants contention appears to be, I cannot accept it.  As
    I said in the overview, the test from <em>J.F.</em> and <em>Pittiman</em> is
    whether the three verdicts are supportable on any theory of the evidence
    consistent with proper instructions of the trial judge.  In my opinion, the
    verdicts are supportable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    starting point is the trial judges instructions on how the jury was to
    approach its task.  She did not tell the jury to take an all-or-nothing
    approach.  Instead, with the approval of both counsel, she instructed the jury
    to consider each charge separately.  She said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Your verdicts on each charge may, but do not have to be the
    same.  They may be the same, but they do not have to be the same, or they may
    be different.  In each case, the verdict will depend on your assessment of the
    evidence and application of the legal principles that relate to that charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>She then went on to outline the legal components of
    each charge separately and independently. </p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of these instructions, the conviction on the charge of sexual
    interference and the acquittal on the charge of invitation to sexual touching
    are reconcilable.  The sexual interference charge against the appellant was
    particularized as touching M.H. with his penis.  The invitation to sexual
    touching charge was particularized as inviting her to touch his penis  in
    other words, inviting her to perform fellatio.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    convicting the appellant of sexual interference the jury accepted that sexual
    activity had occurred.  By acquitting the appellant of invitation to sexual
    touching the jury showed that it did not unreservedly accept all of M.H.s
    testimony.  Although it accepted that the sexual encounter took place, it
    rejected or at least had a reasonable doubt that the appellant directed M.H. to
    perform oral sex on him.  Of course, as the trial judge instructed the jury, it
    was entitled to believe some, none, or all of M.H.s evidence.  Thus, the
    conviction for sexual interference and the acquittal for invitation to sexual
    touching are supportable.  That leaves the conviction for sexual interference
    and the acquittal for sexual assault to be considered.  </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sexual interference and sexual assault</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    principle, the offence of sexual interference requires an intentional touching
    while the offence of sexual assault requires the intentional application of
    force: see s. 151 and s. 271 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, respectively. 
    However, force includes any touching, no matter the degree of strength or
    power applied: <em>R. v. Cuerrier</em>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, at para. 10. See
    also <em>R. v. Ewanchuk</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at paras. 23-25.  Thus, if
    the appellant intentionally touched M.H. in circumstances of a sexual nature,
    the intentional application of force would be implied.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is not, however, how the trial judge instructed the jury.  Instead, as I will
    elaborate on, the jury was told that sexual interference required an
    intentional touching but no use of force.  In contrast, the jury was told
    numerous times that sexual assault required an application of force.  The
    different instructions on whether touching or the application of force was
    required reconciles the different verdicts and shows that they are
    supportable.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    M.H.s age was admitted, on the charge of sexual interference the jury was
    instructed to consider whether the appellant touched M.H. and if so, whether he
    touched her for a sexual purpose.  On the element of touching, the trial judge
    told the jury: Force is not required but an accidental touching is not enough. 
    The full passage where this instruction was given is as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Touching involves intentional physical contact with any part of
    [M.H.]s body.  The contact may be direct, for example, with a hand or other
    part of the body such as a penis.  Force is not required but an accidental
    touching is not enough.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the charge of sexual assault, the trial judge discussed the element of force,
    which she had discounted in her instructions on the sexual interference
    charge.  She told the jury to consider two questions. First, did the appellant
    intentionally apply force to M.H.? Second, was the force applied in
    circumstances of a sexual nature?  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first question, the trial judge elaborated on the nature of the force
    required:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The force applied may be violent, or even gentle.  To be an
    assault, however, [S.L.] must apply the force intentionally.  An accidental
    touching is not an intentional application of force.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The trial judge told the jury that in assessing
    whether force was applied intentionally it should consider actions or words,
    including any threats accompanying the application of force.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the second question on the charge of sexual assault  whether force was applied
    in circumstances of a sexual nature  the trial judge told the jury that the
    application of force included intentional touching.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges instructions on the charges of sexual interference and sexual
    assault  indeed on all three charges  were proper; they were legally correct.
     For each charge she set out the components of the offence, generally following
    the relevant sections of Justice Watts <em>Ontario Specimen Jury Instructions
    (Criminal)</em> (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2005).  Further, both trial counsel
    had an opportunity to review a draft of the jury charge and discuss any concerns
    with the trial judge.  Neither counsel took issue with the relevant aspects of the
    trial judges final instructions.  Moreover, even in this court, the appellant
    did not argue that the trial judges instructions were incorrect in law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    three things about the instructions on sexual interference and sexual assault help
    explain the different verdicts.  First, as I said earlier, the trial judge instructed
    the jury to consider each charge separately.  They were to apply their minds to
    whether guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt on each of the offences
    independently.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    though proper, the instructions were not as complete as they could have been. 
    The jury was given correct instructions on sexual interference juxtaposed with
    correct instructions on sexual assault.  Placing the components of these two
    offences side by side created a contrast between the formers touch
    requirement and the latters force requirement.  More complete instructions
    could have explained the relationship between touch and force  that force
    includes any touching: see <em>Cuerrier</em>.  But the trial judge did not
    clearly tell the jury that the force component of sexual assault was satisfied
    if the appellant intentionally touched the complainant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    on her instructions on sexual assault the trial judge told the jury it could
    consider threats accompanying the application of force.  In contrast, she did
    not tell the jury to consider alleged threats on the other counts, and M.H. had
    agreed that the appellant did not threaten her during the sexual incident.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasonable inference from these instructions is that the jury thought the
    application of force was required to convict on sexual assault but not required
    on sexual interference.  The reasonableness of this inference finds support in
    counsels submissions during the sentencing proceedings.  The Crown observed
    that the jury must have found the appellant did not use force in the sexual
    touching.  Defence counsel agreed.  He said: I agree with my friend when she
    says that obviously the issue of force was rejected.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore conclude that the different verdicts are supportable on the
    instructions of the trial judge and that those instructions, though not as
    complete as they might have been, were legally correct.  Accordingly, the
    appellant has failed to show inconsistency.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction for sexual interference was reasonable</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I agree with the Crown that the conviction for sexual interference is a fair
    result, not an inexplicable one.  M.H.s evidence and the appellants DNA found
    in the inside crotch of her pants reasonably support the verdict.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>conclusion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    verdicts are not inconsistent.  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
