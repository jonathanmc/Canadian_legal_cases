  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on August 22, 2011
    by Justice Alan D. Cooper of the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Heading><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>By the
    Court:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his convictions for a series of sexual
    offences allegedly committed against two nieces, L.J. and L.H., and a
    great-niece, K.J. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alleged offences involving L.J. spanned a time-frame from 1987 to
    1992. The incidents involving L.H. allegedly occurred in 1998 and 2005, and the
    incidents involving K.J. allegedly occurred sometime between 2004 and 2007. All
    of the allegations were reported in 2009.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The convictions were entered following a trial before a judge sitting
    alone. At trial, defence counsel challenged the credibility and reliability of
    the complainants allegations based on: i) the complainants delay in reporting
    their allegations; ii) developments in the complainants allegations between
    the time they were first reported and trial; and iii) alleged vagaries,
    inconsistencies and improbabilities in the complainants evidence. In addition,
    the defence called three witnesses, all family members, who testified about
    their observations of the appellants interactions with the complainants and about
    their own interactions with the appellant. The appellant did not testify.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this court, the appellant alleges numerous errors in the
    trial judges assessment of the complainants evidence and also challenges the
    adequacy of the reasons for judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appeal turns primarily on the emphasized portion of the
    following extract from the trial judges reasons. This extract appears at the outset
    of the trial judges analysis of the charges involving the complainant, L.J.,
    which were the first set of charges he analyzed:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The defence called [J.G.] as a witness, and it was her opinion
    that the complaints by [L.J.] and [L.H.] stemmed from their desire to seek
    attention. Implicit in this evidence is that the allegations are untrue.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This court had the opportunity to see first hand these two
    witnesses as they testified. Both had great difficulty recounting their
    complaints, especially [L.H.], who at times seemed to be emotionally paralyzed
    by the ordeal.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>All three complainants had to testify about a family member, <em>which
    in my view makes their allegations more credible than a complaint against a
    non-family member</em>. Sexual allegations in a family context are explosive
    and threaten to destroy the entire fabric of the relationship. Such complaints
    often divide families, and that is what happened in this case. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the impugned passage reflects an improper
    approach to the assessment of the complainants credibility, as it relies on
    the complainants relationship to the appellant as a general factor supporting
    their credibility. The Crown responds that the impugned passage must be read in
    context. According to the Crown, when that is done, the passage reflects
    nothing more than an experienced trial judge commenting on the lack of motive
    to fabricate, rather than a statement of a general principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although we agree that the passage must be read in context, we are
    unable to accept the Crowns submission. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We begin by noting that it was unnecessary for the trial judge to
    formulate a response to J.G.s evidence, because J.G.s bare opinion about
    whether any of the complainants had a motive to lie was inadmissible and
    therefore irrelevant to the issues before the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly however, on its face, the impugned passage expresses
    the view that, because of the difficulties in family relationships that sexual
    allegations often create, allegations of sexual misconduct made against a
    family member are inherently more credible than allegations of sexual
    misconduct made against a non-family member. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    such, the passage establishes a starting point  or analytical framework  for
    assessing the credibility of the complainants allegations premised on the
    notion that, because of the family context in which the allegations were made,
    they were <em>more credible</em> than similar allegations made against a
    non-family member would be. Such an approach is clearly improper and, standing
    alone, requires that we set aside the convictions and order a new trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, we acknowledge that it would have been open to the
    trial judge to consider whether the family relationship and family dynamics particular
    to this case made it difficult for any of the complainants to testify and to
    take that into account in assessing a particular complainants credibility.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    that is not what the trial judge said. Instead, after referring to the fact
    that all three complainants had to testify against a family member, he stated
    that allegations of sexual misconduct made in that context are <em>more</em> credible than allegations of sexual misconduct made against a non-family
    member. A conviction premised on this analytical framework simply cannot be
    allowed to stand. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of our reasons, we said this appeal turns primarily on the impugned
    passage. We wish to observe as well that, although the Crowns case at trial
    stood largely unchallenged by defence evidence, there were nonetheless problems
    with the complainants evidence mandating a careful examination of each
    complainants reliability and credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, although L.H. maintained that, on one occasion, the appellant had
    touched her leg with his penis from behind her as she climbed some stairs, she
    acknowledged she did not see his penis and was unable to explain why she
    believed that it was the appellants penis that had touched her. In closing
    submissions, the trial Crown effectively acknowledged that this evidence may not
    have been sufficiently reliable to support a conviction for sexual assault (as
    opposed to simple assault). Despite the trial Crowns submissions, the trial
    judge accepted this allegation without comment or explanation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    another example, there were developments in the allegations of all three
    complainants between their statements to the police and their trial evidence 
    all three complainants remembered additional incidents after giving their
    statements to the police.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The trial judge referred to and accepted the evidence regarding two of these
    incidents, largely because of the particular complainants demeanour.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    a proper approach to the assessment of each complainants credibility, we agree
    that these problems with the Crowns evidence were matters uniquely for
    determination by the trial judge. We refer to these problems simply to observe
    that this is not a case in which we can overlook deficiencies in the trial
    judges reasons based on the strength of the Crowns case or based on our own
    review of the record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are set aside
    and a new trial is ordered.  </p>
