  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Bruce A. Glass of
    the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated November 5, 2010.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Epstein
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 22, 2002, Debra Goodwin gave birth to twins. The first,
    Jessica, was delivered vaginally without complications. The second, Adam, was
    delivered by Caesarean section (“C-section”). Unfortunately, Adam was injured
    prior to birth and, shortly after he was born, was diagnosed with spastic
    quadriplegia. Mr. and Ms. Goodwin, on their own behalf and on behalf of their
    three children, brought a negligence action against the health professionals
    involved in Adam’s delivery and against the hospital where Adam was born.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants in that action were: </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Samuel Olupona, the physician in charge of the twins’ delivery; </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nurse Sulabha Burhanpurkar, the nurse primarily responsible for Ms.
    Goodwin’s care until 7:00 p.m., which was a little more than an hour before the
    first baby was born; </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nurse Bernice Thibedeau, the nurse who replaced Nurse
    Burhanpurkar, and the nurse primarily responsible for  Ms. Goodwin’s care
    between 7:00 p.m. and immediately prior to the twins’ births; and </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the Orillia Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few days into the trial, the plaintiffs settled with Dr. Olupona. The
    trial therefore proceeded as a cross-claim by Dr. Olupona against the hospital
    and the two nurses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a 32-day jury trial, followed by 8 days of deliberations, the jury
    returned a verdict finding Nurse Burhanpurkar 75 per cent liable and the
    hospital 25 per cent liable for Adam’s injuries. The jury found no negligence
    on the part of Dr. Olupona or Nurse Thibedeau and the claims against them were
    therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Nurse Burhanpurkar and the
    hospital </span>appeal.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first main ground of appeal is that the jury returned an
    unreasonable verdict. While, in different respects, both appellants challenge the
    findings of negligence, the real focus is causation. The appellants submit<span
style='line-height:200%'> that </span>the jury’s verdicts were unreasonable as
    there was insufficient evidence to establish that any established negligence on
    their part caused Adam’s injuries.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a second main ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the charge
    to the jury contained reversible errors.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. In my view,
    there was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s conclusions that both Nurse
    Burhanpurkar and the hospital failed to meet the requisite standard of care, and
    that their negligence caused Adam’s injuries. The verdict in these respects cannot
    be said to be unreasonable. Further, I find no error in the charge to the jury.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 2:00 p.m. on August 22, 2002, Ms. Goodwin checked into the hospital
    for an elective induction to give birth to twins. There was no indication at
    that point that the babies were other than healthy. At approximately 4:30 p.m.,
    Dr. Olupona performed an ultrasound. The first twin, Jessica, was in the proper
    vertex (head-down) position. However, the second twin, Adam, was in a footling breech
    position, meaning that with a vaginal delivery one or both feet would come out
    first. The doctor did not notify anyone about the twins’ presentation or his
    birth plan. Nurse Burhanpurkar, the nurse primarily in charge of Ms. Goodwin’s
    care at that time, was present during the ultrasound and had access to Dr. Olupona’s
    recorded findings in the chart. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    about 4:45 p.m., Dr. Olupona examined Ms. Goodwin and found her to be four
    centimetres dilated. He broke her water to induce labour, a process known as
    Artificial Rupture of the Membrane (“ARM”). Shortly after administering the
    ARM, Dr. Olupona notified the anaesthetist and the paediatrician of the
    impending delivery, and ordered blood work. He made a further order, noted on Ms.
    Goodwin’s chart, for an “Epidural PRN”. This order directs the nurses to provide
    an epidural if needed or if requested by the patient. The administration of an
    epidural is a two-step process. First, the nurse establishes a mainline intravenous
    with saline solution. Second, an anaesthetist inserts a tube into the patient’s
    lower back through which the pain-relieving substances are delivered. After
    writing his orders, Dr. Olupona returned to his office, a three-minute walk
    from the hospital. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Goodwin began to have contractions at about 5:00 p.m. These contractions,
    together with the extent of her dilation, meant that sometime after that point,
    and by 6:00 p.m. at the latest, Ms. Goodwin was in active labour.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. and </span>Ms. Goodwin<span
style='line-height:200%'>’s uncontradicted evidence is that </span>she asked an
    unidentified nurse for an epidural at 6:00 p.m., and once again between 6:30
    p.m. and 6:45 p.m<span style='line-height:200%'>. </span>She was not given one.<span
style='line-height:200%'> Nurse Burhanpurkar </span>testified that she was not
    aware of the requests or that Ms. Goodwin was even in labour<span
style='line-height:200%'>.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While Nurse Burhanpurkar was responsible for Ms. Goodwin’s care,
    the twins’ heart rates were not monitored continuously <span style='line-height:
200%'>using an electronic foetal heart rate monitor.</span> Rather, they were
    checked only twice – at 4:45 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. using a portable doctone, a
    device that measures the heart rate at a point in time. The results of the FHR <span
style='line-height:200%'>are an indication of the health of the foetus.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>At 7:00 p.m. Nurse Thibedeau took over from Nurse
    Burhanpurkar and assumed care of </span>Ms. Goodwin.  Nurse Thibedeau was incorrectly
    advised that both twins were in the vertex (head first) position. She moved Ms.
    Goodwin into the labour and delivery area. N<span style='line-height:200%'>o
    one there was aware </span>that the second twin was in<span style='line-height:
200%'> footling breech position. Nurse Thibedeau checked the FHRs with a
    doctone sometime between 7:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. The rates were within the
    acceptable range.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Nurse Thibedeau inserted </span>an
    intravenous line in preparation for an epidural. Dr. Rosati, the <span
style='line-height:200%'>anaesthetist on call,</span> had been advised of the
    need to provide Ms. Goodwin with an epidural. However, he<span
style='line-height:200%'> was busy in </span>the <span style='line-height:200%'>O.R.</span> with another patient and indicated he could not attend to Ms. Goodwin’s needs
    until the completion of the surgery in which he was involved.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Orest Sochaniwskyj, who was filling in for Ms. Goodwin’s regular family doctor,
    contacted the hospital shortly before 7:30 p.m. to inquire after Ms. Goodwin. Nurse
    Linda Veitch advised him that Ms. Goodwin had requested an epidural. Dr.
    Sochaniwskyj told the nurse to immediately contact Dr. Olupona. He then left
    for the hospital. Nurse Thibedeau commenced electronic FHR monitoring at 7:56
    p.m., and normal heart rates were registered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Dr. Sochaniwskyj arrived at the hospital, Ms. Goodwin had been transferred from
    the labour and delivery room to case room two, and delivery was imminent. Dr. Olupona,
    who was not contacted until 8:00 p.m., arrived at the hospital at 8:11 p.m.,
    just in time to supervise Dr. Sochaniwskyj’s vaginal delivery of Jessica at
    8:24 p.m. An epidural had not been administered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the Jessica’s delivery, Ms. Goodwin advised Dr. Olupona that she had been
    asking for an epidural since 6:00 p.m. Nurse Thibedeau testified that Dr. Olupona
    was shocked and angry that his order for an epidural had not been followed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Olupona examined Ms. Goodwin and conducted an ultrasound. The second twin
    remained in breech position. Dr. Olupona had no choice but to deliver the
    second baby by C-section in the O.R.; he could not deliver a breech baby
    vaginally unless the mother had an epidural. He also could not perform a
    C-section in case room two as it was poorly lit and the anaesthesia machine was
    not functioning well. Dr. Olupona ordered the O.R. to be made ready “quickly”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nurse
    Thibedeau monitored the FHR of the second baby at 8:35 p.m. and observed a
    deceleration from the normal range. She turned Ms. Goodwin on her side, the
    standard practice under such circumstances, and the heart rate returned to
    normal. The heart rate was monitored once again at 8:45 p.m., and the results
    were normal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    8:57 p.m., Ms. Goodwin was moved into the O.R., and Adam was delivered at 9:24
    p.m. by C-section. He was “flat,” and required resuscitation. He was
    subsequently diagnosed with spastic quadriplegia.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well-established that a jury verdict will be set aside only if it is “so
    plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury reviewing
    the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it”:<i> <em>McCannell
    v. McLean</em></i>, [1937] S.C.R. 341, at p. 343. Further, “[w]here there is
    some evidence to support the verdict, a jury will be accorded a high degree of
    deference”: <em>Gutbir (Litigation guardian of) v. University Health Network</em>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the beginning of oral argument, the appellants conceded that there was sufficient
    evidence upon which the jury could find that Dr. Olupona met the standard of
    care. Nevertheless, in order to provide context for the causation analysis
    central to this appeal, I will here set out some of the evidence that supported
    this verdict.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Andrew Browning, qualified as an expert in obstetrics, gave evidence on behalf
    of Dr. Olupona. Dr. Browning testified that an elective primary C-section was
    much less common in 2002 when Adam was born. In his opinion Dr. Olupona’s plan
    to deliver the twins vaginally and only resort to a C-section if necessary was therefore
    reasonable. The fact that the second twin was in breech position did not, in
    Dr. Browning’s view, change the appropriateness of Dr. Olupona’s birth plan, since
    he had experience in, and felt comfortable with, performing vaginal breech
    extractions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Browning further opined that Dr. Olupona’s order of an epidural PRN was also
    standard protocol. In fact, he said that an order that one be placed immediately
    or at a specified time would not have been reasonable, as the timing of giving
    the mother an epidural depended on the onset of labour. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Browning also supported Dr. Olupona’s actions after being summoned to the
    hospital. He agreed that when Dr. Olupona became aware that his order for an
    epidural had not been complied with, the only reasonable option for Adam’s
    delivery was to perform a C-section in the O.R.  Dr. Olupona did what he could
    to hasten the delivery of the second twin. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appropriateness of Dr. Olupona’s response to the urgency of the situation was
    also supported by Nurse Thibedeau, who testified that Dr. Olupona not only ordered
    the O.R. to be prepared “quickly” but also actually assisted the nurses in preparing
    the O.R.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, the evidence indicated that Dr. Olupona decided upon a reasonable birth
    plan, gave reasonable directions to the nursing staff, and reasonably expected
    the nurses to follow his orders and otherwise carry out their nursing duties in
    accordance with the standard of care expected of them. </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:115%'>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the
    jury err in finding negligence on the part of the hospital given the lack of
    evidence as to the hospital’s standard of care? </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    hospital submits that since Dr. Olupona called no expert evidence on the
    hospital’s standard of care, the jury had no basis to conclude that the
    hospital was negligent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>ter Neuzen v. Korn</em>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 674, the Supreme Court opened the
    door for a jury to decide upon a standard of care without the assistance of
    expert evidence. The court held that a jury was free to find that standard
    practice in the medical industry violated the standard of care, and
    consequently, the jury could decide for itself what constitutes the standard of
    care even where expert evidence says otherwise.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    expert evidence is required turns on “whether the nature of the issue can be
    decided on the basis of the ordinary knowledge possessed by the jury or, on the
    contrary, the matter requires expert evidence because it is beyond the ken of
    the average juror”: <i>ter Neuzen</i>, at para. 55. See also Ellen I. Picard
    and Gerald B. Robertson, <em>Legal Liability of Doctors and Hospitals in Canada</em>,
    4th ed. (Toronto, Ont.: Thomson Carswell, 2007), at p. 460.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    the jury identified the hospital’s breach of the standard of care as being its
    failure to provide appropriately trained nursing staff and ensure that they
    were sufficiently supervised, and its failure to provide adequate equipment and
    resources in its labour and delivery facility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Identifying
    these fundamental obligations – that a hospital must provide staff and
    facilities capable of meeting the basic needs of patients – is well within the
    “ken of the average juror”. These responsibilities form the very foundation of
    a hospital’s duties to its patients.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that while not dispositive, during pre-charge discussions, appellants’
    trial counsel made no objection to the charge on the hospital’s standard of
    care and in fact resisted efforts to make changes. Nevertheless, I see no error
    as, in my view, the evidence of the two doctors, combined with the conventional
    knowledge of the jurors, was sufficient to equip the jury with the information
    necessary to determine the hospital’s standard of care in these areas.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury’s findings that the hospital did not meet its standard of care were also borne
    out by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    terms of the hospital’s obligation to ensure proper training and supervision of
    its nurses, the jury had to look no further than Nurse Burhanpurkar herself who
    admitted that she had limited experience caring for a woman pregnant with
    twins. It was open for the jury to find that Nurse Burhanpurkar was not
    sufficiently competent to care for Ms. Goodwin, and attribute part of this lack
    of competence to the hospital’s failure to train and supervise its nurses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    terms of the hospital’s obligation to maintain and equip its facilities to the
    point that they were functional and safe, as I mentioned above, the jury heard
    from Dr. Robinson and Dr. Olupona to the effect that they would not operate in
    case room two as the lighting was bad and the anaesthetic equipment was
    unreliable. Again, maintaining the physical plant and equipment at a level
    capable of meeting the patients’ needs is the hospital’s responsibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the jury’s verdict concerning the hospital’s negligence was supported
    by the evidence and is reasonable.  </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:115%'><em><span

    Burhanpurkar concedes that she fell below the standard of care in failing to continuously

    of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada indicate that with the
    commencement of labour the FHR should be continuously monitored. Additional evidence
    concerning this obligation was provided by Nurse Kathryn Doren, who gave expert
    testimony that as soon as regular contractions began, a nurse in Nurse
    Burhanpurkar’s circumstances should have commenced continuous FHR monitoring to
    ascertain a baseline heart rate.<span style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>

    Court reaffirmed the primacy of the “but for” test in causation, and in
    particular its application in a robust, common-sense fashion. The court made it
    clear, at paras. 9 and 38, that in concluding that causation has been
    established, the trier of fact may rely on inferences that are reasonably
    available on the evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The “but for” causation test must be applied in a robust common
    sense fashion. <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>There
    is no need for scientific evidence of the precise contribution the defendant’s
    negligence made to the injury</span></span>. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In many cases of causal uncertainty, it is conceivable that
    with better scientific evidence, causation could be clarified. Scientific
    uncertainty was referred to in <em>Resurfice</em><em><span style='font-style:

    in the course of explaining the difficulties that have arisen in the cases.
    However, this should not be read as ousting the “but for” test for causation in
    negligence actions. <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>The
    law of negligence has never required scientific proof of causation; to repeat

  <p class=CQuote>The robust and pragmatic approach takes into account the nature
    of the factual issues underlying the causation question and the kind of
    evidence that the parties are reasonably capable of producing on those issues.
    The approach acknowledges that the causation inquiry is essentially a practical
    one based on the entirety of the evidence and made with a view to determining
    whether the plaintiff has established causation on the balance of probabilities
    and not to a scientific certainty.</p>

    Burhanpurkar was aware of her responsibilities of a high risk pregnancy, but

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury found that Nurse Burhanpurkar’s negligence caused Adam’s injuries as
    follows:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>By not monitoring Debra Goodwin, time of labour was unknown and
    the patient was not transferred from the triage area to the labour and delivery
    unit. Had this transfer been conducted, the labour and delivery nurses would
    have had time to prepare[,] including starting an IV and arranging for an
    epidural. In being transferred to the labour and delivery unit the patient
    would have received one on one monitoring + care, and Dr. Olupona would have
    been notified in regards to patient[’]s progressive condition.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>By not monitoring Debra Goodwin + babies[,] any signs of
    distress were not recorded or acted upon[,] which could have accumulated and
    most likely contributed to Adam Goodwin’s brain injury. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Debra Goodwin’s request[s] for an epidural were not acted upon
    nor did Nurse Burhanpurkar determine that the patient receive an epidural,
    therefore the patient did not receive an epidural in a timely fashion[,] which
    directly contributed to the events that happened after, which most likely [led]
    to Adam Goodwin’s brain injury. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nurse Burhanpurkar did not have a proper plan of action that
    addressed Debra Goodwin and babies needs + well-being and relied upon the
    patient to notify her of any changes in her condition. This resulted in the
    next shift that began at 7:00 p.m. not having a progressive report of the
    patient[’]s condition[,] which contributed to the actions that were undertaken
    later which[,] most likely have led to Adam Goodwin’s brain injury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the hospital, the jury concluded: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>We believe that had [accountable supervision of nursing staff]
    been in place[,] the monitoring of Debra Goodwin and babies[,] which involved a
    high risk pregnancy in a level 2 hospital would have indicated any distress

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Michael Marrin, a neonatologist qualified to provide expert opinion evidence with
    respect to the nature and timing of the injury to Adam, testified on behalf of
    the appellants. Dr. Marrin’s view was that Adam’s neurological problem was, on
    balance, due to a sudden hypoxic ischemic injury (insufficient oxygen to the
    tissues of the body) that occurred less than 30 minutes, and more likely less
    than 20 minutes, before birth. On his theory, FHR monitoring would not have
    revealed any abnormalities, and could not have prevented the injury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    James Low, an expert in foetal monitoring and asphyxia, was qualified as an
    expert in obstetrics and gynaecology on the cause and timing of brain injuries
    suffered by Adam. He gave evidence on behalf of Dr. Olupona.  Dr. Low’s opinion
    was that it was more likely that Adam had sustained intermittent <em>foetal hypoxia
    – periodic episodes in which Adam’s tissues were deprived of</em> oxygen. Over
    time, these short recurrent episodes of foetal asphyxia had a cumulative effect
    that sensitized or weakened the foetus to the point where the brain was damaged.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    can be seen, the primary divide between the two respected experts was over the
    timing of the event that may have caused Adam’s injury. I use the word “may” as
    neither doctor could say with certainty the circumstances that led to Adam’s
    injury. Both experts offered well-thought out and well-researched opinions, but,
    by their own admission, the persuasiveness of their opinions was necessarily
    diminished by the evidentiary uncertainty that is inescapable when dealing with
    injuries in utero.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Low candidly acknowledged the challenges presented by the immutable scientific
    reality that in these circumstances, clinical evidence needed to establish
    causation with any degree of scientific certainty is simply not available in
    the vast majority of cases. He went out of his way to qualify his evidence
    using phrases such as “we are just speculating” and “we can’t say for sure”. These
    qualifications notwithstanding, Dr. Low did provide the jury, as best he could,
    with a causative route to Adam’s injury and with clinical evidence to support
    that route. I refer to evidence of intrauterine growth retardation and of the
    post-delivery discovery of elevated nucleated red blood cells. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Dr. Low cautioned the jury about his views, the jury was entitled to accept
    them, and evidently did so.  . The jury found that Adam’s injury occurred
    between 8 a.m. and birth and not necessarily only in the last twenty or thirty
    minutes. This conclusion is inconsistent with Dr. Marrin’s theory.  As well,
    the jury’s causation answers set out above demonstrate that the time period
    upon which it focussed in finding causation was when Ms. Goodwin was in labour.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the vexing question of causation did not find a definitive answer in the expert
    evidence, the jury accepted the opinion of a decidedly qualified expert who was
    careful not to overstate the certainty with which he held his views and who was
    able to point to supporting clinical evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    subscribing to Dr. Low’s view, the jury accepted, on balance, that Adam’s brain
    injury resulted from the combined effect of intrauterine growth retardation,
    intermittent hypoxia episodes during labour, and then possible asphyxia within
    the last 20 minutes before birth. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellants submit that even on Dr. Low’s theory of causation, the evidence
    does not support the conclusion that Adam would not have been injured but for
    the negligence of Nurse Burhanpurkar and, through her, the hospital.   </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    now to turn to the analysis of this issue.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Dr. Low, the episodes of hypoxia, upon which his opinion of what caused
    Adam’s injury is based, manifest themselves in sudden, brief decelerations of
    the FHR. An episode of hypoxia can be detected by monitoring the FHR. The
    longer Adam is in the womb without proper FHR monitoring, the greater the risk
    that episodes of hypoxia go undetected. The greater the number of undetected
    episodes of hypoxia Adam experienced, the greater the danger of asphyxia
    leading to brain injury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    evidence supports the finding that had Nurse Burhanpurkar monitored the FHRs as
    she was required to do, and had she detected periodic decelerations of Adam’s
    heart rate, Dr. Olupona would have been alerted and he would have delivered
    Adam immediately. The evidence is clear that Adam could have been delivered
    hours earlier than he was. Earlier delivery could have resulted in Adam being
    born before his injury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, the appellants relied on the lack of evidence that any hypoxic
    episodes actually took place while Ms. Goodwin was in Nurse Burhanpurkar’s care
    to support their argument that since causation could not be established the jury’s
    verdict was unreasonable. Specifically, if no hypoxic episodes took place
    between 5:00 p.m. when Ms. Goodwin went into labour, triggering the requirement
    to monitor the FHR on a continuous basis, and 7:00 p.m. when Nurse Burhanpurkar
    went off duty, then her negligence in failing to monitor the FHRs could have no
    impact on the injury caused in accordance with Dr. Low’s theory. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded by this argument. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    direct evidence of causation is not necessary. This court’s recent decision in <em>Gutbir</em> was a case, where, as in this case, a baby was born with a permanent brain
    injury. The jury in that case found the cause of the injury to be prolonged
    partial hypoxic insult – a continuous deprivation of oxygen prior to birth. As
    in this case, the nurse in <em>Gutbir</em> breached her duty of care by failing
    to monitor the FHR. The jury found, on a balance of probabilities, that heart
    rate abnormalities that should have been detected were not.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    upholding the jury’s verdict, this court held, at para. 43:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While there was no direct evidence of causation, there is
    evidence from which the jury could properly infer a causal connection. Dr.
    Carson testified that, if [electronic foetal monitoring] had been used or [manual
    intermittent auscultation] had been done properly, the distress of the foetus
    would have been detected, detection would have prompted intervention, and
    intervention would likely have been beneficial in this case. The jury's answer
    tracks Dr. Carson's evidence which indicates that they accepted it. The
    evidence of Dr. Hill, a paediatric neurologist, was that it takes one or two
    hours of hypoxic ischemic insult before injury results. The extent of the
    injury increases as time goes on. The evidence of Dr. Carson and Dr. Hill
    establishes that, had the standard of care with respect to foetal monitoring
    not been breached, the distress of the foetus would have been detected and,
    once detected, there was sufficient time to deliver Zmora before injury to her
    brain resulted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge that the medical opinions expressed in <em>Gutbir</em> were
    stronger and more certain than the opinion Dr. Low offered in this case. Further,
    the jury in <em>Gutbir</em><i> </i>expressly acknowledged which theory of
    causation it accepted. However, as set out above, Dr. Low’s opinion, one that
    the jury was entitled to accept and that it did accept, provided an evidentiary
    basis for the jury’s finding:  because Nurse Burhanpurkar did not monitor the
    FHR, “any signs of distress were not recorded or acted upon which could have
    accumulated and most likely contributed to Adam Goodwin’s brain injury”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court did in <em>Gutbir</em>, I would reject the appellants’ submission
    that in order for causation to be established, evidence was required as to the
    exact timing of Adam’s irregular foetal heart beat. Here, upon accepting Dr.
    Low’s theory of causation and his evidence that concentrated the timing of the
    hypoxic episodes to when Ms. Goodwin was in labour, the jury could reasonably
    infer that during the first half of Ms. Goodwin’s labour: from 5:00 p.m. to
    7:00 p.m., when Nurse Burhanpurkar was in charge of her care, Adam experienced an
    episode or several episodes of foetal hypoxia.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    takes me back to the words of the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Clements</em> that causation evidence should be approached in a robust and pragmatic fashion,
    having regard to the nature of the factual issues underlying causation and the
    kind of evidence the parties are able to adduce. A review of the evidence of
    both Dr. Marrin and Dr. Low makes it clear that the factual issues underlying
    causation in this case are particularly complex. In addition, Dr. Olupona was
    not able to adduce the clinical evidence that may have provided direct evidence
    of causation.  This is because due to Nurse Burhanpurkar’s own negligence, the
    FHRs, reliable information about Adam’s welfare while Ms. Goodwin was in labour,
    was not available. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    the appellants’ argument would effectively immunize nurses in similar
    circumstances from liability, despite an acknowledged departure from the
    standard of care: c.f. <em>Edige</em><i>r</i>, at para. 44. This would mean
    that where intermittent foetal hypoxia is the theory of causation, the nurse’s
    own negligence in failing to monitor the foetal heart rate would render it
    virtually impossible for the nurse to be held liable.<span style='font-size:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nurse
    Burhanpurkar and the hospital should not be allowed to hide behind a lack of
    evidence brought about by their own negligence, in the face of expert evidence
    supporting Dr. Olupona’s position.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there was evidence capable of supporting the jury’s findings of negligence
    and causation - that on a balance of probabilities but for Nurse Burhanpurkar’s
    failure to properly monitor the FHRs, for which both the nurse and the hospital
    bear a degree of responsibility, it was likely that Adam’s injury could have
    been avoided. </p>
  <h3>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were the jury’s other findings unreasonable?</h3>

style='line-height:200%'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The evidence was replete with areas
    where it could be said that Nurse Burhanpurkar breached the standard of care of
    a nurse in her situation.  Generally, Nurse Burhanpurkar displayed a persistent
    lack of attention to Ms. Goodwin and lack of response to the progress of her
    labour. She </span>failed to administer an epidural in accordance with Dr.
    Olupona’s order. She failed to prepare a plan of care and maintain proper
    records. <span style='line-height:200%'>She did not move </span>Ms. Goodwin<span
style='line-height:200%'> from the triage area (holding and assessment) to the
    labour and delivery birthing room, as she should have done so that Ms. Goodwin
    would have received the attention she needed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    given my conclusion on the issue of FHR monitoring and causation, it is
    unnecessary to decide whether Nurse Burhanpurkar’s other breaches of the
    standard of care were also capable of grounding the causation analysis.</p>

    court reviewing a trial judge’s charge will not hold the instructions to a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge failed to explain to the jury the “but
    for” test and therefore failed to properly set out the law regarding causation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proper test for causation, set out in <em>Clements</em>, at para. 8, is the
    “but for” test: “The plaintiff must show on a balance of probabilities that
    ‘but for’ the defendant’s negligent act, the injury would not have occurred.”  It
    is clear that the trial judge was well aware of the test and properly
    instructed the jury on it. In his charge the trial judge explicitly set out and
    repeatedly reminded the jury of the “but for” test. For example, the trial
    judge stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The law requires that if the physician did not perform medical
    services within the standard of care for an obstetrician, it must be proven on
    a balance of probabilities that the injuries to Adam Goodwin would not have
    occurred <em>but for</em> the action or lack of actions by Doctor Olupona… [Emphasis
    added.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    type of wording was used every time the trial judge instructed the jury with
    respect to its consideration of whether a causal connection had been made out in
    relation to each defendant. This wording was also incorporated into the
    questions the jury was required to answer. Furthermore, when giving his
    instruction on the principle of proximate cause, the trial judge clearly used
    language tantamount to ‘but for’: “[t]he proximate cause of an injury is that
    cause which produces the injury, <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span

    have already dealt with an aspect of this argument in addressing the hospital’s
    argument that no evidence was adduced on a hospital’s standard of care. To
    repeat, the jury was entitled to determine the hospital’s standard of care in
    the absence of expert evidence. I would add the following to respond to this
    ground of appeal.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    further difficulty I have with the appellants’ submission is that it is
    contrary to the position their trial counsel took in pre-charge discussions.
    Dr. Olupona’s trial counsel expressed concern about focusing on the issue of
    Dr. Olupona’s standard of care, as opposed to that of the nurses or the
    hospital. The appellants’ trial counsel disagreed, stating:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Your Honour, there are as it relates to the nurses at Orillia
    Soldiers’ Memorial … there are probably four to five paragraphs in your standard
    of care section that talks about that. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>And first of all your general – the first general paragraph
    about standard of care generally and how it applies to physicians, you then
    confirm that the general principles are also with respect to the nurses. But I
    have counted … four specific paragraphs on either the nurses and/or Orillia
    Soldiers’ Memorial … But I don’t have the same view my friend has in that
    regard. And I don’t know what she is suggesting is missing with respect to it. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I think it’s clear when you read that that the jury will have
    to consider the standard of care of not only each of the physicians[,] each of
    the nurses, and the Orillia Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital not only in its
    capacity as being vicariously liable but also in its capacity as providing
    training and/or resources. So I’m not sure what is missing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is trite law that “in a civil jury trial, the failure to object will be given
    considerable weight”: <em>Brisco Estate v. Canadian Premier Life Insurance Co.</em>,
    2012 ONCA 854, 113 O.R. (3d) 161), at para. 70. The appellants’ trial counsel
    not only failed to object to the charge on this basis, but also actively opposed
    the inclusion of more detail about the standard of care applicable to the
    nurses and the hospital – perhaps in an attempt to encourage the jury to
    concentrate more on Dr. Olupona than on the appellants. In my view, the
    appellants should not be entitled to resile from that position now. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any case, I am not persuaded that the charge was deficient in terms of
    providing the jury with assistance concerning the standard of care expected of
    the appellants. I refer to the following passage in the charge:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nurses and a hospital also have duties towards patients to
    exercise the degree of care in all they do for a patient which could be
    reasonably expect[ed] of a normal prudent nurse with the same professional
    qualifications and training as Nurse Burhanpurkar and Nurse Thibedeau. The
    Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital is a Level II hospital, and it has a duty to
    its patients to provide the degree of care for a patient that could be
    reasonably expected of a Level II hospital when a woman attends for the
    delivery of twin babies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    after detailing the standard of care for a physician, the trial judge indicated
    that “the same concept of duty of care and meeting the standard of care applies
    for [the nurses and the hospital] in their positions as registered nurses and a
    Level II hospital.” It would have been unnecessary to repeat the exact same
    instruction twice, substituting the nurses’ and hospital’s names for that of
    the physician. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    can reasonably assume that the jury understood the trial judge’s instructions.
    The jury, one that clearly took its job seriously, did not ask for any
    additional assistance on any of these issues.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
