    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the judgment of a judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice sitting without a jury that convicted the appellant of sexual offences
    relating to three young girls: his daughter V.B., and her friends J.L. and M.J.
    In relation to each complainant, the appellant was convicted of sexual assault,
    invitation to touch for a sexual purpose, and sexual touching. The girls were
    between the ages of six and eight at the time of the offences. The appellants
    daughter would stay with him on weekends at his apartment, and her friends, who
    lived in the same building, would visit her in the appellants apartment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The allegations came to light when a third friend, C.V., spoke to an
    older sister who contacted the police. The appellant faced the same charges in
    connection with C.V. However, C.V. did not testify at trial and the charges
    relating to her were dismissed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police obtained electronically-recorded statements from J.L. and M.J.
    The girls alleged that the appellant had made them touch his penis while they
    were in his apartment visiting V.B. The police then entered the appellants
    apartment to urgently search for V.B. During the search, they discovered the
    images that gave rise to the child pornography charges. The images included
    pictures of V.B. naked. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was also charged and convicted of two counts of possession
    of child pornography and two counts of making child pornography. No submissions
    were advanced by duty counsel or by the appellant on these convictions. I would
    dismiss his appeal from them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>V.B. initially gave a video statement on May 5, 2002 in which she denied
    any wrongdoing by her father. V.B. then had a number of counselling sessions
    with a social worker, J.M. After these counselling sessions, V.B. made a second
    video statement, on December 20, 2002. In the second statement V.B. made
    similar allegations to those of the other girls, i.e. that the appellant had
    her touch his penis. In her second statement, V.B. also said that the appellant
    had touched her vagina and that she had seen the appellant touching M.J. and C.V.
    as well. V.B., J.L. and M.J. testified at trial adopting their previously
    electronically-recorded statements under s. 715.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified. He flatly denied the allegations and claimed
    the girls must have colluded and fabricated the evidence because he would
    discipline them when they played at his apartment. The defence also argued that
    V.B. had been inappropriately influenced by the social worker. The appellant denied
    knowledge of the pornographic images and testified that others, who were
    allowed to use his computer, were responsible for the child pornography found
    on it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellants testimony finding him to be a
    complete liar who was without conscience and a completely unreliable
    witness. The trial judge admitted the evidence relating to each of the girls
    as similar fact evidence on the charges relating to the others. He found there
    was no evidence that V.B.s testimony had been tainted by the social worker and
    accepted her evidence at trial. He convicted the appellant of the charges in
    relation to each of V.B., M.J. and J.L. As mentioned, he dismissed the charges
    in relation to C.V.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After rendering judgment, the trial judge retired. A different judge
    sentenced the appellant, finding him to be a dangerous offender.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The positions of the parties</h1>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Appellants
    Position</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants overarching ground of appeal is that the reasons of the
    trial judge are inadequate. The appellants argument focuses on three areas. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant submits that the testimony of the three girls was confused,
    confusing and contradictory and that the trial judge failed to explain how he
    resolved the differences in their testimony.  He says that the trial judges
    reasons do nothing more than simply state his conclusions and that his vague
    and general summary of the evidence is inaccurate and shows that he
    misapprehended the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant mounted a particular attack on the trial judges finding that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Subject to what follows [the girls] evidence in common
    asserted that on many occasions, in the case of [V.B.], several cases in the
    case of [M.J.], and in a few cases in the case of [J.L.]<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    they had been inveigled to touch [the appellants] penis and he in turn had
    been allowed to touch their private parts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the evidence of the three girls contained little in
    common. He further argues that this general summary of the evidence is
    inaccurate. The extent of the inaccuracy, he submits, demonstrates the trial
    judge misapprehended the evidence. For example, he argues that M.J. testified
    she touched the appellant only once, not on several occasions, and that the
    appellant did not touch M.J. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the following passages show how the trial judge does
    nothing more than state and restate his conclusions:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am led to conclude that [the appellant] did, in fact, take
    advantage of the young girls, [V.B.], [J.L.] and [M.J.] on a number of
    occasions within the times specified in the charges. <em>There is no
    explanation for their testimony other than the facts which can account for it.</em> I am not swayed by the assertion that the girls testified out of spite, or
    colluded to falsely accuse [the appellant].</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This is simply not supported by the evidence. <em>The fact that
    the girls evidence does not dovetail at all times gives the lie to such a
    suggestion</em>. The taped interviews convinced me that none of them had the
    guile or experience to ever conceive of such a scheme. I consider their
    evidence to be both credible, reliable and necessary in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The evidence of very young witnesses is almost always difficult
    to follow in a direct way. I appreciate that there was upwards of a year to a
    year and a half between the last of these assaults and the police interviews.
    Treatment such as that which these girls have received from a person who owed
    them a duty of trust is not easily forgotten nor was it here. <em>I find the
    girls to be credible witnesses. The truth shone through their testimony. They
    exhibited pluck and intelligence and did their best in the circumstances. Their
    evidence is entirely worthy of belief.</em> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second area the appellant attacks is how the trial judge dealt with V.B.s
    evidence. He submits that the trial judge paid no heed to the substantial
    evidence that the testimony of V.B. was influenced by her interaction with the
    social worker. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant points out that the social worker was present with the police during
    the second interview, read what was written in the activity book and had V.B.
    adopt what had been read. The social worker had written the contents of the
    activity book and the passages that were read out to and adopted by V.B. The
    appellant submits these passages contained words she did not understand such as
    uncomfortable and abuse. He submits the trial judge failed to grapple with
    any of these issues and failed to consider whether they should cause him
    concern about the reliability of the second statement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the appellant says, the trial judge simply stated that V.B.s statement
    supporting her father did not reflect on her credibility in any way and her
    second statement incriminating him was compelling and consistent with the
    events having occurred. These comments, the appellant says, are simply
    conclusions without any explanation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third area the appellant attacks is the trial judges failure to carry out a
    proper analysis of the probative value of the similar fact evidence given the
    many inconsistencies between the evidence of the three complainants. The trial
    judge failed to explain why, in admitting the similar fact evidence, he found

  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Crown Position</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown concedes the trial judges reasons do not contain a detailed analysis of
    the evidence. The Crown submits, however, that despite their deficiencies, the
    reasons, when read as a whole in the context of the evidence and the arguments
    at trial, leave the appellant with no doubt as to why he was convicted. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>General Principles </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    errors alleged by the appellant must be assessed in light of the established
    law on sufficiency of reasons and the deference accorded to the trial judges credibility
    assessments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasons
    are reviewed for their functionality, not their eloquence. As stated in <em>R.
    v. Sheppard</em>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 25-26, <span
class=verdana>an</span> appeal will only be allowed where the reasons are so
    deficient as to foreclose meaningful appellate review. <span class=verdana>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    reasons for judgment cannot be assessed standing alone: reasons for judgment
    must be examined in the context of the entire proceeding, especially the nature
    of the evidence heard and the arguments advanced: <em>R. v. J.J.R.D.</em> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252, at para. 32 (Ont. C.A.). See also <em>R. v. R.E.M.</em>,
    2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    the reasons relate to the assessment of credibility, the sufficiency of reasons
    must be assessed in light of the deference accorded to trial judges
    credibility findings: see <em>R. v. Dinardo</em>, 2008 SCC 24, [2008] 1 S.C.R.,
    at para. 26.  An appeal court must defer to the trial judge on findings of
    credibility, absent palpable and overriding error: see <em>H.L. v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, 2005 SCC 25, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 53. Thus,
    [r]arely will the deficiencies in the trial judges credibility analysis, as
    expressed in the reasons for judgment, merit intervention on appeal: <em>Dinardo,</em> at para. 26.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge has the significant advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence of
    witnesses: see <em>R. v. W.(R.)</em>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 131. This
    deference acknowledges the difficulties both in assessing credibility and
    articulating the reasons a person is believable.  As the court said in <em>R.
    v. Gagnon</em>, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Assessing credibility is not a science. It is very difficult
    for a trial judge to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of
    impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and
    attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is only where the reviewing court has considered all of the evidence before the
    trier of fact, and determined that the credibility determination cannot be
    reasonably supported by that evidence, that the court can overturn it: see <em>R.
    v. Gagnon</em>, at para. 10.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Evidence at Trial</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case the trial record is especially important in considering the sufficiency
    of the trial judges reasons. It is of course impractical to set out all the
    evidence in the record. This was a credibility case in which the trial judge
    totally and emphatically rejected the appellants testimony, and accepted the
    testimony of the complainants. Knowledge of the testimony of the appellant and three
    young girls testimony is vital to understanding the trial judges comments about
    that testimony. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have reviewed the transcripts of the testimony and viewed the video recordings
    of the girls interviews. There is much the transcripts fail to capture:
    demeanour, nods, facial expressions, silent pauses before responses, and people
    speaking at the same time. I find it necessary to set out extensive passages
    from the transcripts to explain my analysis of the issues. </p>

    that?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Answer: I washed my hands.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Question: Did you touch it what he wanted you to touch? Sorry
    yes, no? Yeh I need you to speak up because remember the microphone needs to

    yes or no? [Emphasis added.]</p>

    Im  I know Im gonna ask you a question. I know its probably gonna be hard
    for you but if you can remember help me  uh well see. When he wanted you to
    touch him, what exactly did he want you to do?</p>

    officer allowed the social worker to do the initial questioning. V.B. was
    reluctant to talk. The transcript shows that V.B.s response when the social
    worker asked can you tell me what you told me about um when you went to visit

    what is this book? The social worker explained that the book was an activity
    book in which the social worker would write down what activities they did,
    what V.B. liked and didnt like. The book also contained a history page in

    what my dad said. My daddy made me uncomfortable when he touched me at the
    private, when he touched me under my clothes. Every time I went to visit my dad
    he made me uncomfortable. We got treats for touching my dad at the private,
    sometimes on top of his clothes, sometimes under his clothes. We got five
    treats for doing what my dad told us to do. My friends were in the same room.

    agreed with this passage. The police officer then took over the interview, asking
    questions without any reference to the book. The social workers questioning of
    V.B., including the preliminary questions, covers 8 pages of transcript. The
    police officers questioning continues on for 13 pages.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Question: [V.B.], how did you feel after you played these games
    with your dad?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Answer: Um, not so good.</p>

  <p class=CQuote>Answer: Umm, every time.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 19, 2004, V.B. testified at trial. Before the recorded statement was
    played, the Crown attorney questioned her at length. The Crown attorney first asked
    her about computer and board games she played with her dad and then asked:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Question: Okay. And any other type of games? Ah did you always
    like the games that you played with your dad? </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Answer: Ah not all.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Question: Okay, which one did you not like?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Answer: There were some games that he played that made me feel
    uncomfortable.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Question: Okay. Can you tell me what made you feel
    uncomfortable?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Answer: No.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Question: Okay. Why is that?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Answer: Because um because the games um they didnt really
    have any names.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Question: Okay. Can you tell me what ah  how would you play

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    this testimony, the trial judge ruled V.B.s second statement was admissible
    under s. 715.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and gave reasons that I will refer
    to later. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the trial judge ruled the second statement admissible, V.B.s examination-in-chief
    continued. V.B. continued to avoid answering questions about exactly what the
    games with her father involved. She continued to say the games made her
    uncomfortable, that she and her friends did the things that her dad told them
    to, and that he told them to do things that I didnt like, but she would not
    say what the games were. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown attorney then asked her to write down on a piece of paper what happened
    that made you feel uncomfortable? After V.B. had written something, the Crown
    attorney coaxed her to put down her head and read what she had written. She
    read he told me to touch him in his private part and my friends too. After
    this she became more forthcoming. She went on to say that sometimes her dad was
    wearing clothes and sometimes he wasnt, that this would happen sometimes in
    the bedroom and sometimes in the living room, that she saw what her friends had
    to do. She identified her friends as M.J., C.V. and sometimes J.L. She
    confirmed that she knew what a boys private part was, what the name for it
    was, and where it was located. On a diagram she placed an X that correctly
    identified the anatomical location of a boys penis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cross-examination of V.B. focused on the preparation of the activity book. V.B.
    verified that it was all written by the social worker and that when she said
    something the social worker would write it down right away. V.B. said she learned
    the words uncomfortable, <span lang=EN-US>abuse and private part </span>from
    the social worker. At trial she spelled abuse correctly but could not say
    what it meant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>V.B.
    also agreed that she had had a few opportunities to look at her second video statement,
    that she understood the questions that were asked, and that the police officer
    and the social worker had asked her questions before the recorder was turned
    on. She explained what a secret was and confirmed that she told the social
    worker my dad told me to keep this secret and not tell anybody about it.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of the appellant</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    examination-in-chief, the appellant admitted he knew the girls, and they would
    sometimes come over to the apartment to play with V.B., but he denied ever
    touching any of the girls inappropriately. He described an incident at his
    daughters birthday party where a dispute arose over a Barbie doll that led him
    to discipline the girls. He said he sometimes had problems with the girls
    misbehaving when they visited, and if they did, he would kick them out. The
    defence pointed to his disciplining the girls as motivation for the girls to fabricate
    the allegations. The appellant also testified that the birthday party was the
    one and only time all four girls were ever together at his apartment.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant denied any knowledge of the thousands of pieces of pornography that
    were on his computer. He testified that his brother-in-law and a young man he
    called Mark Evins, along with 10 other young men, had access to his computer
    and were responsible for the pornographic images. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claimed he had an alibi for April 30, 2002, when the computer had
    been used to access child pornography. The appellant testified he had travelled
    by train to visit his mother on April 30, 2002. After police investigation of
    the appellants alibi claim, the Crown led evidence of a Via Rail employee that
    the appellant had travelled on May 1, not April 30, 2002.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, the appellant became angry and combative with the Crown attorney.
    He agreed with the Crown attorney that all four of the girls had been at his
    apartment together on occasions other than the birthday party, but said this
    was only before his wife left, not after. He denied that V.B. came to visit him
    prior to her birthday party, or that the girls visited his apartment prior to
    the birthday party. He said that after the birthday party in 2001, one or two
    of the girls might come over at a time to play with V.B., but never J.L. He
    denied that any of the girls ever slept over. He also disputed the suggestion
    that he was always the only adult when they came over, suggesting that his
    brother-in-law was often there and that a number of other men would be in and
    out to use his computer for a fee. He denied ever inviting the girls to sit on
    his lap and touch his penis, or touching them inappropriately.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Trial Judges
    Reasons in Context</h3>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasons regarding the appellants testimony</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    objection is or could be taken to the sufficiency of the trial judges reasons
    for rejecting the appellants testimony. The trial judge provided a detailed
    explanation for finding him to be a complete liar.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the Crown had established the falsity of the
    appellants alibi beyond a reasonable doubt and this seriously impacted his credibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quite
    apart from the failed claim of alibi, the trial judge noted that none of the
    people who the appellant claimed had been in his apartment and used his
    computer were called to testify. There was no evidence that was even slightly
    convincing that the brother-in-law continued to live at theapartment. The
    trial judge found that there was no evidence that a man named Mark Evins used
    the computer. In fact, Mark Evins was a pseudonym that the appellant used in
    his computer chats with children, the trial judge concluded. The basis of that
    conclusion, the trial judge explained, was a handwritten note that was
    particularly striking. The trial judge stated that Mark Evins and the 10
    other young men the appellant claimed had used his computer were part of a
    systemic plan by [the appellant] to disguise his unlawful activities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was evidence that objectively linked [the appellant] to the computer. There
    were pictures personal to him and his family. Photographs of the appellants
    daughter on his computer showed her, at about age 6, in various suggestive
    poses, naked or partially clothed. The trial judge found this objective
    evidence undermined the appellants denial of the sexual offenses involving his
    daughter and emphasized that these photographs confirmed his prurient interest
    in his own daughter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was also a picture of the appellants son wearing clothing, which allowed his
    genitals to be exposed. The trial judge did not attempt to interpret this
    picture and used it only to conclude it linked the appellant to the other
    pictures on the computer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explained that another reason for disbelieving the appellant was
    his demeanour while testifying. The trial judge described how the appellant
    became progressively more evasive and argumentative during cross-examination.
    He became increasingly irritated, agitated and aggressive and more desperate
    and more creativeHis efforts to extricate himself were obvious and not worthy
    of belief. At one point the appellant had accused the Crown attorney of lying. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the trial judge stated he did not believe the appellants evidence as
    it applied to any issue of substance in this case. The trial judges careful
    and detailed reasons more than adequately serve the purpose of informing the
    appellant why his testimony denying any inappropriate behaviour with the young
    girls was not believed and did not give rise to a reasonable doubt as to his
    guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    rejected the appellants evidence, the trial judge instructed himself on the
    principles of <em>R v. W.(D.),</em> [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, and stated that he
    must then consider the case against him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges reasons as a whole must be considered with this context in mind.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Reasons
    for credibility findings and summary of the evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues the trial judges summary of the girls evidence in common
    reflects a misapprehension of the evidence in that it fails to take into
    account the differences in the girls testimony. He does not, however, take
    issue with the trial judges similar fact ruling. Rather, he submits that the
    trial judges misapprehension of the evidence impacted his analysis of the
    probative value of the similar fact evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument is without merit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts
    have long recognized the increased difficulty in assessing the credibility of
    children as compared to adults. As the Supreme Court of Canada explained in <em>R.
    v. B.(G.)</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at p. 54, although a childs testimony must
    not be subject to a lower standard of proof than an adults: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A] flaw, such as a contradiction, in a childs testimony
    should not be given the same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an
    adultWhile children may not be able to recount precise details and communicate
    the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they
    have misconceived what happened to them and who did it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Every
    person testifying in court is a unique individual and her credibility and
    evidence must be assessed with regard to criteria appropriate to her mental
    development, understanding, and ability to communicate: see <em>R. v. W.(R.),</em> at p. 134.  When evidence is given pertaining to events that occurred in
    childhood, the presence of inconsistencies, particularly as to peripheral
    matters such as time and location, should be considered in the context of the
    age of the witness at the time of the events to which she is testifying: <em>R.
    v. W.(R.), </em>at p. 134.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge recognized these principles.  He said, </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The evidence of very young witnesses is almost always difficult
    to follow in a direct way.  I appreciate that there was upwards of a year to a
    year and a half between the last assaults and the police interviews [and
    later] I consider the <em>essence</em> of the childrens testimony to have been
    consistent and the acts described by them were very similar, if not identical.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    transcript excerpts make apparent that the similarities in the girls evidence
    were obvious and many, and for the most part directly corroborative of each
    other in that the girls each witnessed the appellants behaviour with the
    others.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    excerpts show how hesitant and ill at ease the girls were during the
    interviews. The interviewers, while taking care to avoid leading, often posed a
    second or even third question while the child remained silent. This must be
    kept in mind in understanding the childrens eventual responses. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that the girls tended to talk about general patterns of behaviour
    and the interviewers faced considerable challenges in encouraging them to
    describe specific events. Much of what the appellant sees as inconsistency may
    be traced to a failure to discern when the girls are talking generally and when
    they are describing specific events on particular occasions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    apt example is the appellants submission that the trial judges finding that M.J.
    had been inveigled to touch the appellants penis on several occasions
    reflects a misapprehension of the evidence. The appellant submits that M.J.
    testified she touched the appellants penis only once. It is true she provided
    a detailed description of only one particular occasion where she touched the
    appellant. She told of an occasion when the appellant wanted her to rub his
    penis, she did so, and afterwards washed her hands with soap. Her testimony
    however refers to other incidents when she did so and she speaks about the
    touching happening regularly. Her evidence amply supports the trial judges
    inference that this occurred on other occasions. Moreover, direct testimony of
    both V.B. and J.L. corroborated M.J.s general testimony. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is correct about the detail that M.J. did not testify that the
    appellant touched her private parts. However, direct testimony from the other
    girls supported this finding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any case, the appellants touching of the girls private parts was not an
    essential element of the offences for which he was convicted.  The Crowns
    position was that all three charges were made out not by the fact that he had
    touched their private parts with his hands, but that he had touched their hands
    with his private parts. The Crown attorney made this clear during the course of
    the trial on two occasions in responding to the trial judges direct questions
    about the factual basis for the various counts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is key is that each of the girls provided clear, specific and corroborated testimony
    that the appellant made the girls touch his penis. This was all the Crown had
    to prove to secure convictions on the charges.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, I am not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence
    about the appellant touching M.J.s private parts. In his similar fact ruling,
    he did not include the appellants touching of the girls private parts in his
    list of the similar facts they alleged.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges reasons show he was alive to the differences in the girls evidence.
    Immediately before the passage the appellant most criticizes, the trial judge remarked
    that their evidence did not always fit with one another and that they were less
    than firm about many details in cross-examination. He highlighted many of the
    differences. V.B. said she was sometimes clothed and sometimes naked when these
    events occurred, while [J.L.] and M.J. said they were always clothed. The
    appellant sometimes wore pants and sometimes was exposed when these incidents
    occurred. The trial judge observed that the girls evidence does not dovetail
    at all times.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looking
    at the trial judges reasons as a whole, it is clear that he kept in mind the Supreme
    Courts guidance in <em>R. v. B.(G.) </em>and <em>R. v. W.(R.)</em> that
    contradictions in a childs testimony relating to peripheral details do not
    necessarily undermine their credibility as they might for an adult. It is
    necessary to take into account the witness mental development, understanding,
    and ability to communicate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellant seeks to make entirely too much of the trial judges use
    of the phrase their evidence in common. The girls testimony taken together
    supports the trial judges general conclusion that the <em>essence</em> of the
    childrens testimony was consistent and the acts described by them were very
    similar, if not identical. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in any material
    respect. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasons for concluding V.B.s evidence was not tainted by the social
    worker</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants main submission is that the trial judge did not explain why he
    accepted V.B.s evidence in the face of considerable evidence that clearly
    established the potential that V.B.s evidence was tainted by the social worker.
    He points to the evidence that:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The social worker had met regularly with V.B. over a period of
    months and discussed with her what had taken place with her father.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Everything written in the activity book about what V.B. said was
    written by the social worker, not by V.B.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The social worker attended the second police interview and did
    most of the initial questioning of V.B.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The social worker read portions of the activity book to V.B.
    before the interview began.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When V.B. was not forthcoming at the beginning of the second
    interview, the social worker read from the activity book.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the following passage from the activity book suggests
    the social worker did not record what V.B. said accurately. He contends that a
    child of V.B.s age would be unfamiliar with the words sexual abuse and
    uncomfortable as used in this passage from the activity book: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>We got treats for doing the sexual abuse. We would listen to
    what my dad said. My daddy made me uncomfortable when he touched me at the
    private, when he touched me under my clothes. Every time I went to visit my dad
    he made me uncomfortable. We got treats for touching my dad at the private,
    sometimes on top of his clothes, sometimes under his clothes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that there was considerable evidence of the potential that
    V.B.s testimony could have been tainted by the social worker. He submits the
    trial judge did not deal with this evidence and, in effect, ignored the question
    of the social workers influence on V.B. He submits that the trial judge simply
    said he found V.B.s second statement to be compelling and consistent with the
    events having occurred and concluded, without explanation, that there was no
    evidence of influence by the social worker or any indication of such influence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that V.B.s statement being consistent with the events having
    occurred is not a reason for believing it. This reasoning, he says, shows the
    trial judge must have misapprehended the evidence in order to conclude there
    was no evidence of influence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellants submission that where there is clear and
    considerable evidence of the potential that a witness may have been tainted such
    as exists in this case, the trial judge must explain why he or she accepts the
    testimony of the witness. That said, in this case the trial judge provided
    several sound reasons why he accepted the evidence of V.B in the face of this
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges reasons for accepting V.B.s testimony are brief, and to properly
    understand them it is necessary to consider them in the context of the whole of
    his reasons and what transpired at trial. As the court said in <em>R. v. Gagnon,</em> at para. 19: appellate review does not call for a word-by-word analysis;
    rather, it calls for an examination to determine whether the reasons, taken as
    a whole, reflect reversible error. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge delivered detailed reasons in his ruling on the Crowns s. 715.1
    application to admit V.B.s statement. Those reasons must be considered
    together with his reasons for judgment. In those reasons, the trial judge commented
    that after V.B. had disclosed nothing during her first interview on May 5, 2002,
    the [Childrens Aid Society] had referred V.B. to a social worker who saw her
    frequently over the intervening months. He noted that [t]he worker utilized a
    book in which she recorded the details of V.B.s life and circumstances. He
    recounted that it was the social worker who contacted [the police] and
    arrangements were made for V.B. to be brought to the station for another video
    interview and that [t]he results this time was much more helpful to the Crown
    in that V.B. remembered and discussed several instances of sexual abuse
    involving herself alone or with her friends in various combinations with her
    father being the assailant. The trial judge noted that V.B. testified that
    she remembered the occasion and that she answered the questions truthfully and
    adopted the videotape interview.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge set out the defence arguments that the videotape statement should
    not be admitted. The defence argued that the second statement had not been made
    within a reasonable time, that the first interview had negated the second, and
    that the second was probably highly influenced by the social worker. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    regard to the reasonable time argument, the trial judge noted that considering
    that the alleged perpetrator was her father and that she apparently had been
    told to tell no one, it was hardly surprising a child of such tender years
    would not have come forward earlier. Responding to the defences second
    argument, he added that her inability to cooperate at the first interview
    indicates that she was not emotionally able to deal with these difficult issues
    when first confronted by them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    regard to the defences third argument, the trial judge noted that [t]he authorities
    discussed the intervention of third parties and their effect on the veracity of
    such statements. This is a question of weight and not admissibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    ruled that the second statement would be admitted and that the influence of the
    intervening social worker was a question of weight not admissibility. He also
    ruled that the first videotape was relevant to the question of the weight to
    be given to the second videotape and admitted it into evidence as well to be
    used as considered appropriate by defense counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    V.B.s testimony the trial judge expressed some concern that V.B. could have
    been influenced by the number of interviews with the social worker. He
    commented to counsel that the social worker had not been called as a witness.
    Crown counsel reminded him that there is no requirement on the Crown to call
    each and every witness that might be called in a case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his final reasons, the trial judge offered several succinct reasons for
    accepting the testimony of V.B. despite the evidence indicating the potential
    she had been influenced by the social worker. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge explained that V.B.s testimony [was] corroborated by the
    testimony of the other children. In fact, V.B. had described the same actions and
    context as had M.J. and J.L.  the appellant would have the girls rub his penis
    with their hands, most often while he was seated before the computer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    weighing the similar fact evidence of M.J. and J.L. in assessing V.B.s
    testimony, the trial judge noted there was no evidence that V.B. had access to
    the recorded interviews of the other children or was told what they had to say,
    or that the children colluded in any way. Clearly he was concerned that the
    social worker might have been a conduit between the other girls and V.B. But as
    he observed, neither side had called the social worker. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In point of fact
    there was no evidence at trial that the social worker had counselled the other
    children or even met them. There was no evidence from the social worker about
    her interaction with V.B. The only evidence in the record was what V.B. had
    said in the video statement and at trial: that what the social worker had read
    from the activity book was what she had told the social worker. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me
    that the trial judges statement that there was no evidence of influence by
    the social worker was justified. There was considerable evidence of the
    potential for influence, but no direct evidence that V.B. had actually been influenced.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial
    judge found there was objective confirmation of the appellants interest in his
    daughter. He referred to the photographs of V.B. on the appellants computer taken
    when she was six showing her in various suggestive poses naked or partially
    clothed. He said these confirmed his prurient interest in his own daughter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial
    judge accepted V.B.s testimony at trial as reinforced by the photographs and
    corroborated by the other girls. He said he found her testimony at trial to be
    truthful and reliable. His remark that a reason for believing what she said in
    her second statement was that it was compelling and consistent with the events
    having occurred simply means the statement was consistent with testimony he
    otherwise accepted, that the events occurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the
    trial judge explained that V.B.s first interview provided no reason to detract
    from her credibility in any way. He said There are many reasons why a child of
    tender years might choose to support a parent regardless of circumstances. He
    saw no need to speculate about why V.B. did not implicate her father in the
    first interview. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When his brief
    reasons are considered in the proper context, the trial judge provided an
    adequate explanation of why he accepted V.B.s testimony in the second
    statement despite the evidence about the social workers involvement. The only
    evidence at trial was that the social worker had accurately recorded what V.B.
    had told her. V.B.s statement was consistent with her testimony at trial,
    which he believed. It was supported by the direct testimony of the other girls,
    the similar fact evidence, and the photographs of V.B. in the nude. There was
    no need to explain what motivated her first statement.<span
class=MsoCommentReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span></span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasons for accepting the girls evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    also submitted that the trial judge provided no real reasoning for rejecting
    the defences contention that the girls had colluded. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the record
    at trial is considered, however, it is immediately apparent that there was no
    evidence whatsoever that the girls colluded. M.J. had moved away and J.L.
    testified she no longer played with V.B. The trial judge did say that the
    assertion that the girls testified out of spite, or colluded to falsely accuse
    [the appellant] was simply not supported by the evidence. In his ruling on
    the Crowns similar fact application he said I find no credible evidence that
    establishes that the victims colluded in formulating their evidence, or were
    involved in a plot to falsely accuse [the appellant]. He need not have said
    anything more. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    criticizes the trial judges remark that he rejected the possibility of
    collusion, fabrication and collaboration among the complainants because:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The motives suggested for such fabrication do not ring true. Such
    an effort on their part would have required a sophistication and venality far
    beyond their years.None of them had the guile or experience to ever conceive
    of such a scheme.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    also pointed to the trial judges remarks that The truth shone through [the
    girls] testimony. They exhibited pluck and intelligence and did their best in
    the circumstances, that the girls evidence was compelling and highly
    probative, and that he was convinced of the truthfulness of [the girls]
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    criticized these remarks as devoid of legal reasoning. The criticism appears to
    have some force if the remarks are considered in isolation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When, however, the
    remarks are considered in the context of the reasons and the trial process as a
    whole, their meaning is readily apparent. The trivial disciplining of the girls
    by the appellant did not provide a credible motive for fabricating false
    allegations. If the girls had colluded to tell a false story they would have
    simply told it. The defence theory required not only a colluded story but
    feigned reluctance to tell it and tortured discomfort in telling it. The
    concoction and carrying out of such a scheme was inconsistent with the girls
    demeanour in giving their evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing
    credibility, the trial judge was entitled to give his impression of the young
    witnesses. The trial judge found the girls demeanour to support his finding that
    they were credible witnesses. Review of the videotapes and the transcripts
    supports his observation about their demeanour. He had already concluded that
    the theory of collusion the appellant put forward at trial was simply not
    supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    trial judges conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    instructed himself on the approach to assessing credibility mandated by the
    Supreme Court in its decision <em>R. v. W.(D.).</em> He said that nothing in
    [the appellants] evidence caused me to have a reasonable doubt about his
    guilt and concluded that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt. Earlier, I reviewed the trial judges ample and detailed reasons for
    disbelieving the appellants evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    concluded by stating he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the appellant
    was guilty of the sexual offences charged. His reasons exhibit no error. His
    conclusion regarding the pornography charges is not raised in this appeal.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additional issues</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes
    that the sexual interference convictions ought to be stayed pursuant to <em>R.
    v. Kineapple</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, as they arise from the same conduct as
    the sexual assault convictions. The three sexual interference convictions in
    relation to V.B., M.J. and J.L. are stayed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only
    submission on sentence advanced on behalf of the appellant was that, if his
    appeal was successful, the finding he was a dangerous offender would have to be
    revisited. I would refuse leave to appeal sentence.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conclusion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In rejecting the
    appellants submissions about the sufficiency of the trial judges reasons I
    keep in mind what Binnie J. said at para. 26 of <em>Sheppard</em>, The
    appellate court is not given the power to intervene simply because it thinks
    the trial court did a poor job of expressing itself.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude
    that the trial judges reasons, considered as a whole in the context of the
    evidence and what transpired at trial, are adequate to justify and explain the
    result. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    knows full well why he was found guilty. The trial judge did not believe him
    but found him to be a complete liar. The trial judge believed the evidence of
    each of the girls that the appellant caused them to touch his penis. His denial
    did not give rise to a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would order
    the sexual interference convictions be stayed and dismiss the remainder of the appeal.</p>
