  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Shah v. Becamon</em>, 2009 ONCA 113, 94 O.R. (3d) 297, this court
    held that the graduated licence scheme set out in the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (“<em>HTA</em>” or the “<em>Act</em>”) applied only to the
    operation of a motor vehicle on a “highway” as defined in the <em>HTA</em>.  The
    court further held that the shopping plaza parking lot where the accident
    occurred was not a “highway” within the definition in the <em>HTA</em>.  No one
    questions the correctness of either holding.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Shah</em>, the court went on in <em>obiter dicta</em>, at para.
    23, to hold “the entire <em>HTA</em>, including the graduated licence system,
    is limited to ‘highways’.”  In this case, counsel for the Crown (the “appellant”)
    submits that this <em>obiter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> is wrong
    insofar as it limits the operation of the “entire </span></em><em>HTA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>” </span></em>to only “highways”.  Counsel contends that
    “highway” is a defined term in the <em>HTA</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'> that appears in many, but not all, provisions of the </span></em><em>HTA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>.  He submits that the definition of “highway” cannot
    be read into the sections of the </span></em><em>HTA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> that do not use the word “highway” or some other
    word that incorporates the definition of “highway”.</span></em> Specifically,
    counsel submits that the accident reporting requirement in s. 199 makes no
    reference to “highway” and applies even when the accident triggering the
    reporting requirement occurs on property that does not fall within the meaning
    of “highway”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel appointed as <em>amicus</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    however,</span></em> submits that the <em>obite</em>r in <em>Shah</em> is
    correct.  He contends that the purpose and object of the <em>HTA</em> is the
    protection of persons using public roadways and that the reach of the <em>HTA</em> has been limited to “highways” in various contexts by this court.  In support
    of his argument, counsel points to the difference between the <em>HTA</em> and
    corresponding legislation in many other provinces, which, unlike the <em>HTA</em>,
    does not restrict the meaning of the word “highway” by reference to public
    access and use.  Counsel submits that the <em>obiter</em> in <em>Shah</em> is
    consistent with the more limited definition of “highway” used in the <em>HTA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the position advanced by the appellant.  I would hold that
    the <em>obiter</em> in <em>Shah</em> limiting the operation of the “entire <em>HTA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>” to “highways” is wrong</span></em> and should not
    be followed.  Many provisions of the <em>HTA</em> are by their terms limited to
    “highways”.  Other provisions, however, are not so limited.  Nothing in the
    overall structure of the <em>HTA</em> or its purpose compels the reading of the
    word “highway” into sections in which it does not appear.  Section 199 is one such
    section.  I would hold that the reporting requirement in s. 199 generally applies
    even if the accident does not occur on a “highway” as defined in the <em>HTA</em>.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:

    his vehicle into a car parked in a supermarket parking lot.  According to the
    prosecution, even though there was substantial damage to the parked vehicle,
    the respondent drove away.  He was charged with failing to report the accident
    as required by s. 199(1) of the <em>HTA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em><a

  <p class=CQuote>Every person in charge of a motor vehicle or street car who is

    in personal injuries or in damage to property apparently exceeding an amount
    prescribed by regulation, report the accident forthwith to the nearest police
    officer and furnish him or her with the information concerning the accident as
    may be required by the officer under subsection (3).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Justice of the Peace, after noting that the accident had occurred on
    private property in a parking lot, raised the issue of the applicability of s.
    199.  He referred counsel to the then recent decision in <em>Shah</em>.  Ultimately,
    the Justice of the Peace, relying on <em>Shah</em>, dismissed the charge and
    held that s. 199 did not apply to an accident that occurred on property that
    did not fall within the definition of “highway” in the <em>HTA</em>: <em>R. v.
    Hajivasilis</em>, 2009 ONCJ 310.  He did not address the merits of the
    allegation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Mocha J., of the Ontario Court of Justice, held that the
    Justice of the Peace had correctly followed the <em>obiter dicta</em> in <em>Shah</em>: <em>R. v. Hajivasilis</em>, 2012 ONCJ 110.  She did the same and dismissed the
    appeal, observing at para. 22 that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the decision in <em>Shah</em> needs further clarification,
    it must occur at the Court of Appeal, not here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rouleau J.A. granted leave to appeal from that decision.  As the appeal
    squarely raised the correctness of the <em>obiter dicta</em> in <em>Shah</em>,

  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>the statutory interpretation problem</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>HTA</em> defines “highway” as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>“highway” includes a common and public highway, street, avenue,
    parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct or trestle, <span
class=Underline>any part of which is intended for or used by the general public
    for the passage of vehicles</span> and includes the area between the lateral
    property lines thereof[.]  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    phrase “intended for or used by the general public for the passage of vehicles”
    limits the meaning of “highway”.  If a vehicle is being driven on property to
    which the general public does not have access or if that access is for a
    limited purpose other than passage (such as parking), the property will not
    fall within the meaning of “highway”.  Most privately owned parking lots are
    not “highways” as defined in the <em>HTA</em>: see <em>R. v. Mansour</em>,
    [1979] 2 S.C.R. 916; <em>Gill v. Elwood</em>, [1970] 2 O.R. 59 (C.A.); and <em>Sked
    v. Henry</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (1991)</span></em>, 28 M.V.R.
    (2d) 234 (Ont. Gen. Div.).  It is accepted that the parking lot where the
    respondent allegedly struck the parked vehicle does not fall within the meaning
    of “highway” in the <em>HTA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    word “highway” appears repeatedly in the <em>HTA</em>, especially in offence-creating
    provisions.  For example, s. 32(9) prohibits a person from driving a motor
    vehicle “on a highway” in contravention of the terms of his or her driver’s
    licence.  That section clearly has application only when the driving occurs on
    property that falls within the meaning of “highway”.  A person driving without
    a licence on property that is not “intended for or used by the general public
    for the passage of vehicles” is not in violation of s. 32(9).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    words used in the <em>HTA</em> are defined using the word “highway”.  In doing
    so, those words arguably incorporate within their definition the limitation
    found in the definition of “highway”.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> 
    “Driver” and “roadway” are two examples.  According to s. 1(1) of the <i>HTA</i>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>“driver” means a person who drives a vehicle on a highway;</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>“roadway” means the part of the highway that is improved,
    designed or ordinarily used for vehicular traffic, but does not include the
    shoulder, and, where a highway includes two or more separate roadways, the term
    “roadway” refers to any one roadway separately and not to all of the roadways
    collectively[.]  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    for example, s. 48, which allows a police officer to “require the driver of a
    motor vehicle to stop” for a specified reason, arguably has application only on
    highways as defined in the <em>HTA</em> since, by definition, “driver” means “a
    person who drives a vehicle on a highway”.  A person driving a motor vehicle on
    a private parking lot is at least arguably not a driver for the purposes of the <em>HTA</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    199 does not use the word “highway” or any word that incorporates the word “highway”
    in its statutory definition.  The question of statutory interpretation raised on
    this appeal can be put in these terms:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'>Is s. 199 of the <em>HTA</em>, which does not use the word “highway”, subject
    to the same limitation found in the definition of “highway” such that s. 199
    applies only when the accident occurs on property “intended for or used by the general
    public for the passage of vehicles”?  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span

    proceeding with my application of the “modern principle” to s. 199, I note that

    Ct. J., after an analysis that fits easily within the “modern principle”

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin my examination of the statute with the language of s. 199(1).  For ease of
    reference, I repeat the relevant part of the section:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Every person in charge of a motor vehicle … who is directly or
    indirectly involved in an accident shall, if the accident results in personal
    injuries or in damage to property apparently exceeding an amount prescribed by
    regulation, report the accident forthwith to the nearest police officer and
    furnish him or her with the information concerning the accident as may be
    required by the officer….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    plain reading of s. 199(1) reveals no reference to the word “highway” or any
    word that incorporates the definition of “highway”.  The reporting obligation in
    s. 199(1) is placed on “every person in charge of a motor vehicle”.  If the
    legislature has defined certain terms in the definition section of legislation,
    but chooses to use other undefined terms in a particular section, the
    interpretative exercise must strive to give some meaning to the choice made by
    the legislature.  In s. 199, the legislature chose to use the phrase, “every
    person in charge of a motor vehicle”, a more expansive phrase than the word “driver”. 
    This choice suggests a reporting requirement that is not limited to persons who
    fall within the definition of the word “driver”, that is, persons who drive a
    vehicle on a “highway”.</p>

    of the responsibilities of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles set out in s. 205 are
    limited to accidents or other traffic-related concerns on “highways”.  The
    responsibilities relate to all accidents and related traffic conditions in the
    province.  The broad responsibilities of the Registrar, particularly as they
    relate to the accident reports generated by s. 199(1) and other sections of the <em>HTA,</em> are consistent with an interpretation of s. 199 that requires the
    reporting of all motor vehicle accidents that meet the criteria specified in that
    section.   </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    further broadening of the context leads next to a review of the entirety of Part
    XIV of the <em>HTA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, the part of the </span></em><em>HTA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> containing s. 199.  That Part includes various </span></em>reporting
    requirements.  A review of the four reporting requirements most closely
    connected to s. 199 reveals that two use the word “highway” while the other two
    do not.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    199.1 contains reporting requirements relating to vehicles that are irreparable
    or salvage, both defined terms under the <em>HTA</em> and its regulations:  see
    e.g., s. 199.1(4).  The reporting requirements make no reference to “highway”
    or any word incorporating the definition of “highway”.  Section 199.1 is clearly
    intended to give the Registrar notice of vehicles that have been badly damaged
    as the use of those vehicles could pose a safety risk.  That purpose is not
    served by a reading of s. 199.1 that would limit reporting requirements to
    vehicles on a “highway”.  Indeed, if the vehicle reaches the “highway”, it may
    well be too late to worry about any requirement to report the status of the
    vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    202 imposes a reporting duty on Crown Attorneys and police officers.  The
    section applies only when there is a fatal accident.  The section does not use
    the word “highway”.  A plain reading would suggest that all fatal accidents are
    subject to the requirements of s. 202. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    200, like s. 199, contains a provision requiring the reporting of accidents. 
    Section 200, however, imposes duties on the person in charge of the vehicle in
    the accident that are more onerous than the reporting requirement in s. 199.  By
    its terms, s. 200 applies only “[w]here an accident occurs on a highway”.  Section
    201, imposing another reporting requirement, is again specifically limited to the
    operating or driving of a vehicle “upon a highway”.  Sections 200 and 201
    indicate that when the legislature wanted to limit a reporting requirement to
    an accident or other event that occurred on a “highway”, it specifically wrote
    that limitation into the reporting requirement.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  My
    review of the language used in the various reporting requirements in Part XIV
    satisfies me that if the legislature determined that the particular reporting
    requirement should be triggered only by events which occurred on a “highway”,
    it expressly said so.  When it chose to impose a broader reporting requirement,
    it refrained from using the word “highway” or any other defined word, such as
    “driver”, that would restrict the reporting requirement to “highways”.  The <em>obiter</em> in <em>Shah</em> would effectively erase one of the distinctions written into
    the various reporting requirements by the legislature.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Broadening
    the context from Part XIV to the entirety of the <em>HTA</em> offers no support
    for reading “highway” into s. 199.  Numerous provisions in the <em>HTA</em>,
    like s. 199, do not use the word “highway” or any related word.  Many of those
    sections create duties that are intended to protect the public by regulating various
    activities relating to motor vehicles.  Many of those duties cannot reasonably
    be seen as contingent upon or properly limited to circumstances in which a
    motor vehicle is used on a “highway”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, there are provisions requiring the licensing, permitting or
    authorization of motor vehicle dealers (s. 59), driving instructors (s. 58), and
    persons who pick up passengers for compensation (s. 39.1).  There are also
    provisions requiring that dealers of second-hand motor vehicles keep certain
    detailed records (s. 60) and that sellers of rebuilt tires clearly identify the
    tires as rebuilt (s. 71(3)).  Moreover, there are provisions prohibiting the
    defacement or alteration of licence plates (s. 12), the submission of false or
    inaccurate documents to the Ministry (s. 9), and the possession of more than
    one owner’s permit referable to the same licence plate or vehicle (s. 7(15)).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    provisions described above, and many others in the <em>HTA</em>, regulate
    various activities associated with motor vehicles.  Even though the duties
    imposed by these provisions are not tied directly to the operation of a vehicle
    on a “highway”, the provisions clearly enhance public safety in connection with
    the use of motor vehicles whether on the highway or elsewhere.      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    the provisions of the <em>HTA</em> dealing with the “Rules of the Road” (Part

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> which are clearly most closely associated with conduct on a “highway”, are not
    all limited to highways.  For example, s. 134 authorizes a police officer, in any
    of the enumerated circumstances, to “direct traffic according to his or her
    discretion” and requires every person to obey those directions.  The section
    says nothing about limiting this authority or duty to “highways”.  Police
    officers will have occasion, in the interests of public safety, to direct and
    control traffic in a place that is not a “highway”.  It would defeat the obvious
    purpose underlying s. 134 if it were read as being limited to a “highway”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, my review of the <em>HTA</em> as a whole demonstrates that many of the
    duties created by various sections of the <em>HTA</em> that do not use the word
    “highway” cannot be limited to “highways”.  Viewed from the perspective of the <em>HTA</em> as a whole, context contraindicates reading all sections of the <em>HTA</em> as

    1.1 does not suggest that, absent an appropriate regulation, all provisions of
    the <em>HTA</em> are limited to “highways”.  The section permits the extension
    by regulation of the <em>HTA</em>, or a provision of the <em>HTA</em>, to
    places other than highways.  Thus, a section that by its terms was limited to “highways”
    could be extended to other places by regulation without the need to amend the
    provision itself.  Section 1.1 offers no support for the contention that absent
    an appropriate regulation, all provisions of the <em>HTA</em> are referable
    only to “highways”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    1.1 does, however, provide context in a somewhat different way.  The section contemplates
    the extension of the entire <em>HTA</em> or parts of it to places other than
    highways.  This broad regulation-making power is inconsistent with the <em>obiter</em> in <em>Shah</em> that would limit the HTA to “highways”.  The regulation-making
    power in s. 1.1 is, however, entirely consistent with an interpretation of the <em>HTA</em> that extends beyond highways.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude my search for context in the legislation by reference to the title of
    the legislation – the<em> Highway Traffic Act</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>.</span></em><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>  In </span></em><em>Shah</em>, at para. 35, the
    court stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Indeed, not surprisingly, the entire <em>HTA</em> applies to
    what its title foreshadows, highways.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The
    title of an enactment can assist in the interpretation of a provision within
    the enactment:  see <em>Temelini v. Ontario Provincial Police (Commissioner)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (1999)</span></em>, 44 O.R. (3d) 609 (C.A.), at pp.
    620-21.  In my view, it places far too much weight on the title of the <em>HTA</em> to suggest that a word that is given a specific definition in the text of the statute
    effectively becomes a description of the scope of the statute because that word
    is used in the title.  Had the legislature intended the word “highway” to
    define the scope of the <em>HTA</em>, I would have expected a specific
    statutory provision addressing the scope of the <em>Act</em>, and not merely a
    definition of the word “highway” applicable to the legislation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with counsel for the appellant that a comparison of the English and French
    titles of the <em>HTA</em> supports his position.  The French title of the <em>HTA</em> is “Code de la route”.  The French version defines “highway” as “voie
    publique”.  The title of the French version of the <em>HTA</em> considered along
    with the definition of “highway” in the French version suggests that the <em>Act</em> is not limited to “highways”.  The French and English versions of a statute are
    equally authoritative: <em>Legislation Act, 2006</em>, S.O. 2006, c. 21, Sch.
    F., s. 65.</p>
  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>the object of the <em>HTA</em></span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    modern approach to statutory interpretation looks to the purpose or object of
    the statute as an aid in interpreting the statute’s provisions.  This approach
    is legislatively mandated in Ontario by s. 64 of the <em>Legislation Act, 2006</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>An Act shall be interpreted as being remedial and shall be
    given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as best ensures the
    attainment of its objects.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no preamble to the <em>HTA</em> and nothing in the <em>Act</em> speaks directly
    to the objects of the <em>HTA</em>.  Nor did counsel in their comprehensive
    presentations refer to any of the usual secondary sources that might assist in pinpointing
    the objects of the <em>Act</em>.  In attempting to discern the object of the <em>HTA</em>,
    one is left with the circular proposition that the words of the <em>HTA</em> enlighten
    the reader as to the objects of the <em>HTA</em> which in turn assist the
    reader in giving meaning to the words in the <em>HTA</em>.  As Rothstein J.
    recently cautioned in <em>Canada v. Craig</em>, 2012 SCC 43, 347 D.L.R. (4th)
    385, at para. 30, interpreting words by reference to unexpressed legislative
    intention purportedly discovered through a purposive reading of those words must
    be avoided: see also <em>Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada</em>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 622,
    at para. 43.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>Bearing that caution in mind, the case law does identify in
    broad terms the object of the <em>HTA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.
    In </span></em><em>R. v. Raham</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2010
    ONCA 206, 99 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 33, the court refers to the </span></em><em>HTA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> as “public welfare legislation designed to protect
    those who use the roads of the province.”  Earlier, in </span></em><em>Hydro-Electric
    Power Commission of Ontario v. Bruell Float Service Ltd.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (1974), 3 O.R. (2d) 108, at p. 114, aff’d on other
    grounds [1976] 1 S.C.R. 9, this court said:</span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The general purpose of the </span>Highway
    Traffic Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> is the regulation of the
    use of the highways by persons on foot and in vehicles; that is not to say that
    certain provisions of the statute will not apply to the use of vehicles other
    than on a highway, but in an over-all sense the Legislature is directing itself
    to the regulation of vehicular traffic and not to commerce conducted in or by
    means of vehicles.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, regulation to protect the public using the province’s roads is not
    necessarily limited to roads that fall within the meaning of “highway” in the <em>Act</em>. 
    Public safety concerns might well demand regulation in respect of traffic in
    large private parking facilities even though those facilities are not used by
    the general public for “the passage of vehicles”.  Similarly, public safety
    concerns might well demand the regulation of private parking facilities as
    incidental to regulations maintaining the safety of the “highway” leading into
    and out of that facility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insofar
    as s. 199 is concerned, I think it can be argued that public safety is enhanced
    by a general reporting requirement with respect to accidents involving injury
    or a certain level of property damage.  Lessons learned from the reports with
    respect to those accidents may enhance the overall safety of the roads by
    identifying safety concerns that have application beyond the immediate
    circumstances of the particular accident.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    I place the language of s. 199 in the context of its related provisions, the <em>HTA</em> as a whole, and the object of the <em>HTA</em>, I see no reason to read the
    word “highway” into the <em>Act</em>.  In my view, the section makes perfect
    sense and is consistent with the object of the <em>HTA</em> if it is read as
    written.</p>
  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>other arguments</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Amicus</em> has made two additional arguments which do not fit exactly into the contextual
    analysis as I have set it out.  I will briefly address both arguments.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>First, </span></em><em>amicus</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> submits that </span></em>an interpretation that
    extends s. 199 beyond accidents on “highways” leads to absurd results.  For
    example, he suggests that the appellant’s interpretation would require persons
    who slam their hands in a car door while it is parked in their driveway to
    report that “accident” under s. 199.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The potential absurdity
    raised by </span></em><em>amicus</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> turns
    on the meaning of the word “accident” in s. 199 and not on whether the section
    applies to places other than “highways”.  Any problems relating to the
    interpretation of the word “accident” arise in respect of the various reporting
    conditions imposed in ss. 199, 200 and 201.  That interpretative problem is for
    another day.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Second, </span></em><em>amicus</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> submits that s. 199 should not be read as applying
    to private property because the reporting requirement forces persons involved
    in accidents to provide potentially incriminating information to the police.  The
    potential use of any statutorily compelled statements in subsequent proceedings
    raises issues that have a constitutional and evidentiary dimension.  Those
    issues are no doubt important but, in my view, have no connection to the interpretation
    of s. 199.  If the section raises legitimate self-incrimination concerns, those
    concerns are not properly addressed by effectively reading down the legislation.  </span></em></p>
