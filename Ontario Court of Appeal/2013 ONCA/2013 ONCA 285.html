  <p class=Judge>Gillese J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The respondents
    were charged with production of marijuana, possession of marijuana for the
    purpose of trafficking, and possession of the proceeds of crime. The charges
    arose after a search warrant was executed at 39 Patricia Avenue in Toronto.
    Police located 2881 marijuana plants, and the respondents, inside the house. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The respondents
    brought an application for an order quashing the search warrant and excluding
    the items seized by the police.  They argued that once misleading information
    was excised from the Information to Obtain (“ITO”), what remained was insufficient
    to justify the issuance of the warrant, and that the telewarrant application
    process used in obtaining the warrant had been improperly interfered with by a
    police constable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The trial judge accepted
    these arguments and found a s. 8 violation under the <em>Canadian Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</em>.  He excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> and acquitted the respondents.  </span></p>

    that follow, I would allow the appeal.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>On April 21,
    2009, Detective Constable David Wallace received an email from Debbie Kupcho,
    an employee of Toronto Hydro Electric System, alerting him to a possible
    marijuana grow operation at 39 Patricia Ave.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Kupcho provided DC
    Wallace with hydro readings for the property and two nearby properties, 37
    Patricia Ave. and 40 Patricia Ave.  She also provided him with a Smart Meter
    graph, which showed the hourly consumption of power at 39 Patricia Ave.  The
    Smart Meter takes amperage readings every 15 minutes.  This information is then
    transformed into a graph that shows a building load over many days.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The information
    that Kupcho sent DC Wallace showed average daily consumption data for the
    previous twenty months for 39 Patricia Ave. and the two other nearby
    residences.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>DC Wallace believed
    from his experience that the power cycle illustrated by the graph for 39
    Patricia Ave. reflected one of the stages of a marijuana growing process.  As
    well as following a mechanical pattern, the power-draw at 39 Patricia Ave. was
    large.  The data showed that from October 2008 to February 2009, 39 Patricia
    Ave. consumed almost six times more power than the adjacent property at 37
    Patricia Ave., and 1.8 times more power than 40 Patricia Ave. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>On April 22,
    2009, DC Wallace attended at 39 Patricia Ave. at 1:30 p.m. This, it will be
    noted, was the day before the ITO was submitted and the search warrant issued.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>From the edge of the
    property, DC Wallace could smell the distinct odour of freshly growing
    marijuana. He recorded this information in his notebook: &quot;can smell slight
    odour of fresh marijuana coming from the backyard area.&quot;  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In addition to
    the smell of marijuana and the hydro data, 39 Patricia Ave. displayed a number
    of other physical signs commonly seen at grow operations. Specifically, DC Wallace
    observed that:</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The ITO</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In his affidavit,
    which forms part of the ITO, DC Wallace began by setting out his background and
    experience with marijuana grow operations, and describing the general
    investigative sources on which he had relied.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In the following part
    of his affidavit, DC Wallace provided the information that he had received from
    Kupcho, including the Smart Meter graph.  He deposed that in the case of a
    suspected illegal marijuana grow operation, the load jumps up at a specific
    time each day and then drops down at a specific time each day.  This jump in
    electrical usage reflects the lighting cycle used in an illegal marijuana grow
    operation.  He stated that depending on the stage of growth of the plants, the
    lights operate on different cycles.   He said that the graphs showed an
    “obvious” sixteen hour cycle was being used at 39 Patricia Ave., and that the
    graph was a “perfect example” of the workings of a marijuana grow operation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Next, DC Wallace set out the readings
    of the daily average consumption of energy at 39 Patricia Ave. and the two
    neighbouring properties.  He stated that 39 Patricia Ave. was using 5.8 times
    more electricity than was 37 Patricia Ave. and 1.83 times more electricity than
    40 Patricia Ave.  He said that both of the comparison residences were
    “approximately the same size” as the residence at 39 Patricia Ave.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In the section that followed, DC
    Wallace described more fully the observations that he had made the previous day
    when he attended the property and which he viewed as being consistent with the
    property being used as a grow operation.  He also stated that &quot;[a] smell
    of fresh marihuana could be detected emanating from the backyard area&quot;.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Two pages later in his affidavit, he
    stated that &quot;Officers attended the side of the residence and noticed a
    very strong odour of fresh growing marihuana emanating from the rear of the
    residence”.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>DC Wallace deposed
    that the main grounds in the investigation were the odour of freshly growing
    marijuana and the hydro consumption.  However, based on his experience, he considered
    that the condition of the residence and property were indicative of a grow
    operation as well.  He explained that a typical grow house appears neglected or
    uninhabited because it is, in fact, not lived in; windows are covered to
    conceal the marijuana and keep the necessary heat inside; shingles on the roof
    of grow houses are often peeling, due to the heat given off by the growing
    process; the discarded butane cooker and empty canisters in the backyard are
    consistent with the operators having disconnected the electric stove in the
    residence so that the stove outlet could be used for power for the grow
    operation; and, the rear door to the residence, which appeared new, was made of
    heavy steel.  This was not consistent with the other doors on the house, which
    were old and appeared to be in need of replacement.  The fortified steel door was
    consistent with operators attempting to protect their marijuana crop from other
    criminals and law enforcement officers.  </span></p>

    preparing the ITO at around 7:15 a.m. on April 23, 2009.  At that time, he was
    in the midst of a long run of long shifts. The Toronto Police were conducting
    an operation to take-down a large number of marijuana grow operations and he
    had been tasked with writing many warrants.  He was regularly working 12 hour

    DC Wallace could not say with certainty that no plant other than marijuana
    required that type of light cycle to flourish.  He found that all that was left

    example, in relation to DC Wallace’s view that the residence did not appear
    lived in, the trial judge found the assertion to be unsupported because DC

    Wallace prepared a number of warrants that day, all the other warrants were
    applied for in person.  He concluded that while it might have been
    inconvenient, it was not impracticable for DC Wallace to have attended in

    growing process.  He stated this in the IT0 and did not resile from that
    position.  </span></p>

    appears that the trial judge discounted the Smart Meter evidence because he could
    not independently verify DC Wallace’s interpretation of that data.  </span><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>As the reviewing judge, that was not
    the function he was to perform.  His role was to decide whether the respondents
    had discharged their burden of showing that DC Wallace’s interpretation was
    incorrect or misleading.  While there were some legitimate questions raised
    about the precise pattern of power consumption (i.e. the length of the cycle),
    there is no question that the data showed the type of pattern deposed to by DC
    Wallace, namely, that over a period of time, power was consumed at 39 Patricia
    Ave. in a mechanically precise way, with a timed high-intensity period of usage
    followed by a drop, which corresponded to the needs of a marijuana grow
    operation.  </span></p>

    the state of the residence, the trial judge excised virtually all of DC
    Wallace’s observations about its physical condition and appearance.  As the
    Saskatchewan Court of Appeal recently noted in <i>R. v. Savage </i>2011 SKCA
    65, 239 C.R.R. (2d) 102, at para. 20, the fact that there may be innocent
    explanations for certain observations when considered individually does not
    mean the observations are to be treated as innocuous or ignored.  The test is
    not whether there might be an innocent explanation for an observation but
    whether the presence of such facts enhances or makes more likely the
    possibility of a the crime: <i>Savage</i>, at para. 21.  </span></p>

    not challenged on the fact that he made the observations.  He did not resile
    from those observations.  They should not have been excised.      </span></p>

    also erred, in my respectful view, in excising the evidence regarding the smell
    of marijuana.  It will be recalled that he did so because he felt that DC
    Wallace had overstated the evidence on this point.  However, the </span><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>evidence that DC Wallace smelled
    marijuana at the house was uncontradicted.  It was proper for the trial judge
    to excise the description of the smell as “strong” but there was no basis for
    excising the evidence of the smell of freshly growing marijuana entirely from
    the ITO.    </span></p>

    after excising the offending portions of the ITO?  In para. 1 of its factum,
    the Crown describes the information as follows.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The house at 39 Patricia Ave. showed the textbook signs of
    being a marijuana grow-operation.  It looked uninhabited but consumed large
    quantities of electricity.  It drew that power in a classic, repeated cycle
    consistent with mechanically timed high-intensity marijuana grow lights.  The
    windows were all covered and the shingles were peeling (a common side-effect of
    the excess heat and humidity).  And, perhaps most tellingly, the odour of fresh
    marijuana could be smelled from the sidewalk.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    recalled that s. 487.1 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>permits an application for a
    search warrant application to be made by telecommunication where it would be “impracticable”
    to attend personally.  The trial judge found that while it would have been
    inconvenient for DC Wallace to attend in person to apply for the warrant, it
    was not impracticable.  Having found that the standard of impracticability had
    not been met, use of the telewarrant procedure was in breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </span></p>

    conclusion, the trial judge considered the full factual matrix including the
    non-urgent nature of the application, the absence of any “cogent” reason for DC

    relation to the opening hours of the intake justice of the peace offices.  </span></p>

    the Crown’s submission that telewarrants merely provide an alternate process
    for obtaining warrants and that there is no reason to limit their use.  If that
    were the case, the legislation would not have included the requirement that
    appearance in person must be “impracticable”.  I agree with the trial judge
    that inconvenience is not the same as impracticability and, in my view, it was
    open to the trial judge to conclude that the record before him did not
    establish that it was “impracticable” to obtain a warrant in the usual manner.</span></p>

    stated that the Crown’s inability to adequately explain what communication was
    received by the justice, after she initially declined to issue the warrant and
    prior to issuing it, meant that there was no evidence before the court as to

    to the contrary.  DC Wallace testified that if such a telephone conversation
    took place, it was to find out about the timing of the application and when it
    might be considered.  Det. Matthews’ affidavit evidence was to the same
    effect.  He deposed that he did not remember calling the justice but it was
    possible.  He went on to depose that if he did call the telewarrant centre that
    morning, it would have been only to confirm whether there was a justice
    available at that time to consider the application.  </span></p>

    appears to have based his analysis on the assumption that the respondents were

    conceded that the respondents had an expectation of privacy sufficient to
    permit them to bring the <i>Charter </i>challenge, nothing more was known than
    that they had been found in the house at the time the warrant was executed. 
    There was no evidence that the respondents used the property as a home – as

    Any expectation of privacy the respondents had in the home was seriously
