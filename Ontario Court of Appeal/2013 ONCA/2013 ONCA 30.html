  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Armstrong
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss the
    appellants’ claim for enforcement of two American judgments against the
    respondents, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iranian Ministry of Information and
    Security, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The motion judge granted the
    respondents’ motion on the basis that the <em>State Immunity Act</em>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. S-18 (the “<i>SIA</i>”), bars the appellants’ enforcement claim. The
    cross-appeal concerns the motion judge’s decision to award costs against the
    respondents even though they were successful on the motion. For the reasons
    that follow, I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between 1982 and 1988, Iran directed the kidnapping and detention of 18
    American citizens in Beirut, Lebanon, for the purpose of collecting a ransom.
    Alann Steen and David Jacobson were two of the individuals kidnapped. Both were
    detained for an extended period of time, kept in inhumane conditions, and
    subjected to mental and physical abuse. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alann Steen and his wife, Virginia Steen, sued the respondents in the
    United States District Court for the District of Columbia for damages arising
    out of Mr. Steen’s captivity. The respondents did not appear. On July 31, 2003,
    the court awarded a judgment of US$342,750,000 against the respondents.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>David Jacobsen’s children, Eric, Paul and Diane, and his sister, Doris
    Fisher, sued the respondents in the same court for damages arising out of David
    Jacobson’s captivity.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Again, the respondents did not appear. On October 6, 2006, the court awarded a
    judgment totalling US$6,400,000 against the respondents.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These judgments have not been satisfied in the United States and the
    appellants commenced an action in Ontario seeking to enforce them. The
    respondents moved under rule 21.01(2) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, to dismiss this action on the basis that they are immune
    from the jurisdiction of any court in Canada pursuant to s. 3(1) of the <i>SIA</i>.
    This provision reads: “Except as provided by this Act, a foreign state is
    immune from the jurisdiction of any court in Canada.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the motion judge, the appellants submitted that the respondents’
    conduct that gave rise to the American judgments constituted “commercial
    activity” within the definition of s. 5 of the <i>SIA</i>, which states: “A
    foreign state is not immune from the jurisdiction of a court in any proceedings
    that relate to any commercial activity of the foreign state.” The appellants
    argued that, based on the commercial activity exception, the respondents are
    not immune from the court’s jurisdiction. In the alternative, the appellants
    contended that the common law of state immunity continues to apply, which
    precludes immunity for acts of terrorism, kidnapping, torture and
    hostage-taking committed by or on behalf of sovereign states.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge held that kidnapping and detention do not constitute
    “commercial activity” under the <i>SIA</i> and therefore the exception under s.
    5 does not apply. Following this court’s decision in <em>Bouzari v. Iran</em><i> </i>(2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 675, the motion judge also concluded that the <i>SIA</i> is a complete code that permits no common law exceptions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also sought a stay of the proceedings pursuant to s. 106
    of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, in the event that
    the motion judge ruled that the <em>SIA</em> barred the action. The request for
    a stay was premised on proposed legislation then before the House of Commons,
    which would have amended the <em>SIA</em> to prevent a listed foreign state
    from claiming immunity from the jurisdiction of the Canadian courts in relation
    to its actions in support of terrorism. It was submitted that Iran would be one
    of the listed states, which would remove its immunity under the <em>SIA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge declined to grant the stay as the proposed legislation
    had not passed through Parliament.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the respondents’ success on the motion, the appellants were awarded costs of
    $70,000.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Change in the Law Since the Decision of the Motion Judge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the motion judge’s decision, the <em>Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act</em>,
    S.C. 2012, c. 1, s. 2 (the “<i>JVTA</i>”), came into force on March 13, 2012.
    Section 4(5) of the <em>JVTA</em> provides:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>A court of competent jurisdiction must recognize a judgment of
    a foreign court that, in addition to meeting the criteria under Canadian law
    for being recognized in Canada, is in favour of a person that has suffered loss
    or damage [as a result of terrorist acts that would be punishable under Part
    II.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>]. However, if the judgment is against a
    foreign state, that state must be set out on the list referred to in subsection
    6.1(2) of the <i>State Immunity Act</i> for the judgment to be recognized.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>Concomitantly, the <i>SIA </i>was amended to provide
    for a list of countries that would “not [be] immune from the jurisdiction of a
    court in proceedings against it for its support of terrorism on or after
    January 1, 1985”: <i>SIA</i>, s. 6.1(1). On September 7, 2012 – after this
    appeal had been heard – the Governor General in Council established the list of
    countries, which includes the Islamic Republic of Iran: <em>Order Establishing
    a List of Foreign State Supporters of Terrorism</em>, SOR/2012-170, s. 2.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the argument of this appeal (May 23, 2012) counsel for the appellants
    knew that Iran would likely be listed pursuant to s. 6.1(2) of the <em>SIA</em> in September 2012. Counsel advised that he expected the appellants would pursue
    whatever rights they had as a result of the new legislative regime. However,
    the appellants still wished to pursue this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, the court questioned counsel for the appellants about the need
    for pursuing this appeal. The court pointed to what appeared to be at that time
    the imminent addition of Iran to the list of countries that are not immune from
    jurisdiction in proceedings concerning a state’s support for terrorism. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    acknowledged having considered the question of mootness with respect to this
    appeal. However, counsel took the position that it was not certain at that point
    whether Iran would be added to the list, and so the appeal was not yet moot.
    Counsel requested the court to decide the issues on the appeal in light of the
    law as it stood at the time the appeal was argued. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court cannot simply ignore that Iran has been added to the list of foreign
    state supporters of terrorism referred to in s. 6.1(2) of the <em>SIA</em>.
    However, I would be prepared to decide the issues raised by the appellants
    because it is not a foregone conclusion that the addition of Iran to the list
    will result in a successful proceeding to enforce the two American judgments.
    Such further proceeding in the Superior Court of Justice would require a
    consideration, <em>inter alia</em>, of the application of s. 6.1(1) of the <em>SIA</em> and s. 4 of the <em>JVTA </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>to the
    present circumstances</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(i)    The
    motion judge erred in concluding that the kidnapping and detention of Alann
    Steen and David Jacobsen did not constitute commercial activity within s. 5 of
    the <em>SIA</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(ii)   The
    motion judge erred in failing to apply a common law exception to state immunity.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(iii)  The
    motion judge erred in failing to conclude that the respondents lost the benefit
    of state immunity by committing acts in violation of peremptory norms of
    international law (<em>jus cogens</em>).</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Commercial Activity Exception</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Bouzari</em>, some of the same legal issues were raised before this court. 
    While the facts in <em>Bouzari</em> are not identical, there are similarities
    to the case at bar. Over a six-month period, Houshang Bouzari was abducted,
    imprisoned and brutally tortured by agents of the Iranian government. After his
    release, he escaped from Iran and eventually ended up in Canada as a landed
    immigrant where he sued Iran for damages.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a motion before in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Swinton J. found that
    the action could not succeed because it was barred by the <em>SIA</em> and it
    did not fall within the exceptions in the <em>SIA</em>. The case was appealed
    to this court.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goudge
    J.A., writing for the court, agreed with the motion judge that the commercial
    activity exception in s. 5 of the <em>SIA</em> did not apply. At para. 51 of
    his reasons he said:   </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I agree ... that the commercial activity exception does not
    apply here. Section 5 of the Act requires that the acts to which the
    proceedings relate (namely the acts of torture) be commercial in nature. It is
    not enough that the proceedings relate to acts which, in turn, relate to
    commercial activity of the foreign state. To interpret the exception in this
    way, as the appellant contends, would broaden the exception beyond the clear
    language of the <em>SIA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Bouzari</em>.
    In that case, Mr. Bouzari was kidnapped, imprisoned and tortured for refusing
    to pay a bribe in the context of an oil and gas transaction. Goudge J.A. held,
    at para. 53, that “apart from their purpose, the acts of torture underpinning
    the appellant’s action cannot be said to have anything to do with commerce.” In
    essence, torture is not a commercial act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The appellants argue that in this case, the systematic
    exchange of hostages for money and guns does constitute a commercial act. They
    contend that it makes no difference to the legal analysis that the
    consideration for money and guns was human beings, rather than a commodity like
    oil.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge, at para. 42, that “the exchange of human beings
    for weapons and money [does not fall] within the ordinary meaning of commercial
    activity in s. 5 of the [<em>SIA</em>].” A mere nexus to commercial activity is
    insufficient to invoke the exception. Rather, the nature of the acts for which
    relief is sought – in this case kidnapping, detention and torture – must be
    commercial. As the motion judge held, at para. 42, “[t]he fact that Iran
    demanded the payment of money and weapons before releasing Mr. Jacobsen and Mr.
    Steen does not alter the true nature of hostage taking as a brutal criminal
    act.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    thus would not give effect to the first ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    Alleged Common Law Exception to State Immunity</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the motion judge failed to apply the decision of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Kuwait Airways Corp. v. Iraq</em>, 2010 SCC 40,
    [2010] 2 S.C.R. 571, which they submit left open the question whether there is
    a common law exception to state immunity. LeBel J., writing for the court, said
    at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As I mentioned above, the <em>SIA</em> represents a clear
    rejection of the view that the immunity of foreign states is absolute. It
    reflects a recognition that there are now exceptions to the principle of state
    immunity and in so doing reflects the evolution of that principle at the international
    level. But I need not determine here whether the <em>SIA</em> is exhaustive in
    this respect or whether the evolution of international law and of the common
    law has led to the development of new exceptions to the principles of immunity
    from jurisdiction and immunity from execution (on this issue and the
    controversies it has generated, see F. Larocque, “La <em>Loi sur l’immunité des
    États</em> canadienne et la torture” (2010), 55 McGill L.J. 81). It will
    suffice to determine whether the commercial activity exception applies in the
    case at bar. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>According to the appellants, at common law, Iran does
    not benefit from state immunity on the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Kuwait Airways</em>, LeBel J. found it was unnecessary to decide the issue
    whether common law exceptions to state immunity exist, since the case could be
    disposed of on other grounds. However, this court in <em>Bouzari</em> concluded
    that the exceptions to state immunity listed in the <em>SIA</em> are
    exhaustive. At paras. 56-59, Goudge J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The final argument related to the <em>SIA</em> issue is raised
    by the intervener CLAIHR. It argues that the enactment of the <em>SIA</em> has
    not displaced the common law of state immunity and that, under that common law,
    torture cannot be legitimized as a government act and cannot therefore attract
    immunity.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, the wording of the <em>SIA</em> must be taken as a
    complete answer to this argument. Section 3(1) could not be clearer. To
    reiterate, it says:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>3.(1) <span class=Underline>Except
    as provided by this Act</span>, a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction
    of any court in Canada [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The plain and ordinary meaning of these words
    is that they codify the law of sovereign immunity. Indeed in<i> Re Canada
    Labour Code</i>, [</span>[1992] 2 S.C.R. 50]<span style='font-size:17.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'> </span><span lang=EN-US>La Forest J.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span

    for the appellants invites us to reconsider the court’s characterization of the <em>SIA</em> in <em>Bouzari</em> and to apply a common law exception to state
    immunity. In my view, not only are we bound by the court’s conclusion in <em>Bouzari</em>,
    Goudge J.A.’s reasoning for reaching that conclusion is persuasive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    after this appeal was argued, the Quebec Court of Appeal in <em>Islamic
    Republic of Iran v. Hashemi</em>, 2012 QCCA 1449, expressed its agreement with
    the above analysis in <em>Bouzari</em>. Morissette J.A., writing for the court,
    held at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, what Goudge J.A. wrote on behalf of the Court in
    paragraphs [56] to [59] of his reasons is entirely apposite – in fact, it
    coincides with most of the preceding observations on the <em>SIA.</em> I
    therefore see no reason to depart from his reasoning: the exceptions to state
    immunity in Canadian positive law are those set out in the <em>SIA</em>, not in
    some remnant of a hypothetical common law doctrine that would coexist with the
    Act, or in some rule of customary international law that might modulate the
    interpretation of a statutory phrase which in fact is in no need of
    interpretation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the language in s. 3(1) of the <em>SIA</em> is clear and does not
    permit the application of a common law exception to state immunity. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><em><span style='line-height:200%;font-style:normal'>(iii)<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    now turn to the concept of <em>jus cogens</em> and whether the motion judge
    erred in failing to conclude that the respondents lost their entitlement to
    sovereign immunity because their acts were in violation of peremptory norms of
    international law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peremptory
    norms of international law, or <em>jus cogens</em>, are higher forms of
    customary international law from which no derogation is permitted: see <em>Bouzari</em>,
    at para. 86. The content of <em>jus cogens</em> is not settled, however,
    generally-accepted examples of such norms include the prohibitions against
    genocide, slavery, apartheid and torture: John H. Currie, Craig Forcese and
    Valerie Oosterveld, <em>International Law: Doctrine, Practice, and Theory</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2007), at p. 159</span></em>.
    According to the appellants, a state that violates peremptory norms of
    international law – which they say include prohibitions against torture and
    terrorism – cannot rely on the immunity provided in the <em>SIA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> because, in committing such acts, the state is not
    acting in a sovereign capacity.</span></em> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <em>jus cogens</em> issue was addressed by the court in <em>Bouzari</em>.
    Goudge J.A. concluded at para. 94 of the reasons: “The peremptory norm of
    prohibition against torture does not encompass the civil remedy contended for
    by the appellant.” Goudge J.A. further remarked at para. 95:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Both under customary international law and
    international treaty there is today a balance struck between the condemnation
    of torture as an international crime against humanity and the principle that
    states must treat each other as equals not to be subjected to each other’s
    jurisdiction. It would be inconsistent with this balance to provide a civil
    remedy against a foreign state for torture committed abroad. In the future,
    perhaps as the international human rights movement gathers greater force, this
    balance may change, either through the domestic legislation of states or by
    international treaty. However, this is not a change to be effected by a
    domestic court adding an exception to the <i>SIA </i>that is not there, or
    seeing a widespread state practice that does not exist today.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the recent decision in <em>Hashemi</em>, released on August
    15, 2012, the Quebec Court of Appeal rejected the argument that customary
    international law has developed to recognize an exception to state immunity in
    cases where violations of <em>jus cogens</em> norms are alleged. In rejecting
    this argument, Morissette J.A. relied on the decision of t<span lang=EN-US>he
    International Court of Justice in </span><em>Jurisdictional Immunities of the

    of state immunity at para. 93:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>This argument therefore depends upon the
    existence of a conflict between a rule, or rules, of </span><em>jus cogens</em><span
lang=EN-US>, and the rule of customary law which requires one State to accord
    immunity to another. In the opinion of the Court, however, no such conflict
    exists… The two sets of rules address different matters. The rules of State
    immunity are procedural in character and are confined to determining whether or
    not the courts of one State may exercise jurisdiction in respect of another
    State. They do not bear upon the question whether or not the conduct in respect
    of which the proceedings are brought was lawful or unlawful. </span></p>

    Investments Ltd. v. Szijjarto</em> (2006), 218 O.A.C. 315 (C.A.), at para. 21,
    this court set out the test for leave to appeal a costs order as follows: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Leave to appeal a costs order will not be granted save in
    obvious cases where the parties seeking leave convinces the court that there
    are “strong grounds upon which the appellate court could find that the judge

    leave the matter of costs to the court.” In spite of this position before the
    motion judge, the respondents now seek to appeal her costs award.</p>
