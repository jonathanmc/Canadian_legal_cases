    Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant was found guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant.
    He was sentenced to fourteen months imprisonment followed by two years probation.
    He appeals his conviction and, if leave to appeal is granted, seeks leave to
    appeal his sentence. In relation to conviction, the appellant raises three
    grounds of appeal, all of which relate to the trial judges reasons.  The
    appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in three respects. 1) He made
    findings of fact based on conjecture and misapprehensions of the evidence. 2)
    He failed to properly apply R. v. <em>W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 (S.C.C.).
    3) He failed to consider the appellants honest but mistaken belief in
    consent.  In relation to sentence, the appellant submits that it is overly
    harsh and long. </p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After an evening spent drinking at a bar, the appellant, his brother,
    and three women drove to the appellants home. Except for the appellants
    brother who was driving, all of them were drunk.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant felt unwell during the truck ride on the way to the
    appellants house and put her head down in the lap of her girlfriend, Ms. Reid.
    Upon arrival, she opened the truck door and vomited on the driveway. She had to
    be helped out of her boots in the house, and helped upstairs to a second floor
    bedroom and into bed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The others continued the party in the kitchen then moved to the computer
    room. The appellant left the computer room where the party was ongoing. After a
    very brief period of time his absence was noted. Ms. Reid left the computer
    room and discovered the appellant having sexual intercourse with the
    complainant. Ms. Reid testified that she grabbed the appellant and told him to
    get off the complainant. The complainant was still fully clothed from the waist
    up; her winter coat was still on and her purse was across her torso; her pants
    were partially off. Ms. Reid said the complainant seemed stunned, began crying
    and looked confused. Ms. Reid and Ms. Ruscoe eventually helped the complainant
    put her pants back on, helped her down the stairs, put on her boots and then
    helped her leave the house.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that she was sleeping in the bedroom when she
    felt a dark figure over top of her. She felt pressure in her vaginal and pelvic
    areas. It was uncomfortable but did not seem real. She testified that it seemed
    like it was a dream.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he was on his way to the bathroom when he
    met the complainant in the hallway. He stated that they kissed in the hallway
    and moved to the bedroom where she had previously been. They then had
    consensual sexual intercourse there.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE TRIAL COURT JUDGMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that at the time that Ms. Reid first assisted the
    complainant into bed, the complainant was without capacity to consent to sexual
    activity, including sexual intercourse with the accused. After the discovery of
    the sexual intercourse, the evidence of the complainant, Ms. Reid, and Ms.
    Ruscoes testimony was to the effect that the complainant was not pretending to
    be asleep or confused. She was genuinely extremely groggy and confused.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not believe the appellants testimony about what
    happened between him and the complainant.  He rejected the appellants evidence
    that the sexual intercourse was consensual and added:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Further, the accuseds testimony does not raise a reasonable
    doubt in my mind about whether the sexual intercourse was consensual. Finally,
    I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, that when the accused was having
    sexual activity, including intercourse, with the complainant, she was incapable
    of consenting to the sexual activity including sexual intercourse and that the
    accused knew that. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the incapacity
    of the complainant was due to intoxication, illness and/or sleepiness, either
    any one of them alone or in combination with one or all of the other factors.</p>
  <p class=Heading>ISSUES AND DISPOSITION</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by making findings of fact based on conjecture
    and misapprehensions of the evidence?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judges analysis of the evidence
    was faulty. He submits that the trial judge based his conviction of the
    appellant on an inappropriate analysis, on speculation and conjecture and on
    findings of fact unsupported by the weight of the evidence.  In particular, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge used the fact the appellant and
    complainant met for the first time that night and that she was still wearing
    her coat with her purse strapped across her torso, the appellants inability to
    give detail about their move from the hallway to the bedroom, the issue of
    whether the bedroom door was open and the appellants alleged lie about his
    daughter being home that night, to find it implausible that the complainant
    would have sex with the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion, the appellants allegations do not meet the stringent standard
    that applies to appellate reversal on the basis of misapprehension of the
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    core of the trial judges reasoning is that when the complainant was put to bed
    by her friend, Ms. Reid, the complainant was without capacity to consent to
    sexual activity. He found that a short while later, she was still without
    capacity to consent to sexual activity when found by her friends having
    intercourse with the appellant. We do not agree that the trial judge engaged in
    speculation. The trial judge was entitled to take into consideration the
    evidence of how long the appellant and complainant had known each other, her
    state of dress when she was having intercourse, and the appellants omission of
    detail respecting how the complainant got from being upright in the hallway
    onto the bed with him, along with all of the other evidence concerning her
    physical condition in assessing the credibility of the witnesses. Even assuming
    there is some merit in the appellants contention i.e. concerning whether his
    daughter was asleep in the house, and whether the door to the bedroom was open,
    these points are peripheral and do not affect the core of the trial judges
    reasoning. Overall, the trial judge made reasonable inferences from the
    evidence and did not engage in impermissible speculation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits that the trial judge gave greater scrutiny to a minor
    inconsistency in the appellants prior consistent statements to the police than
    to the complainants erroneous statement respecting the doctors report. Simply
    because the trial judge weighed these two individual pieces of evidence
    differently does not mean that he applied greater scrutiny to the evidence of
    the appellant than of the complainant. We do not agree he applied different
    levels of scrutiny to the evidence of the defence and the Crown witnesses. The
    findings the trial judge made were open to him. </p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in his application of <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, s<i>upra,</i> by not properly evaluating the whole of the evidence to determine reasonable
    doubt?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge applied the correct burden and standard of proof  he did not treat
    this case as turning on whose evidence he accepted. He provided extensive
    reasons for why he found the complainant lacked the capacity to consent, and
    explained why he believed the Crown had proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by not considering the defence of honest but
    mistaken belief in consent?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis that the case was argued at trial, the sole issue was whether the
    complainant consented to have sex with the appellant.  Section 273.1(2)(b)
    provides that no consent is obtained where the complainant is incapable of
    consenting to the activity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    us, the appellant submits that the trial judge was also obliged to consider
    whether the appellant had an honest belief in the appellants consent. Inasmuch
    as we see no error in the trial judges finding that the complainant was
    incapable of consenting to sexual activity and his finding that the appellant
    knew this, the defence has no air of reality. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal as to conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=Heading>SENTENCE</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
