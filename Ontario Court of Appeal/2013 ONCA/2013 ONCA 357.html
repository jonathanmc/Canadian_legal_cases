  <p class=Judge>Gillese J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal and cross-appeal revolve around a jury verdict rendered after
    a 13-day civil trial.</p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND IN BRIEF</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>          <b><i>The Accident</i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matthew Knox and Kyle McLean (“McLean” or the “plaintiff”) began
    drinking at Finnigan’s bar in the evening of June 3, 2005.  They continued
    drinking at Finnigan’s bar until approximately 3:00 a.m. the following morning. 
    The evidence suggests that both Knox and the plaintiff were seriously intoxicated
    when they, and two others, climbed into Knox’s car and Knox drove off.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly afterwards, 19 year old Knox lost control of his car while
    driving at an excessive speed down a main street in Renfrew, Ontario.  Neither
    Knox nor Brad Pelletier, a young cook from Finnigan’s bar who was in the rear
    seat directly behind Knox, were seriously injured.  Tragically, 19 year old
    Lindsay Norton – the fourth occupant in the car – was thrown from the car and
    died.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLean, also aged 19, was found upside down, hanging from his seatbelt,
    unconscious and bleeding from his head.  The most serious injuries he suffered
    were a concussion and a fracture in three areas of his right elbow, which
    extended into the joint.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>The Law Suit</i></b>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLean sued Knox, as the driver of the vehicle, and 1197584 Ontario
    Inc., carrying on business as Finnigan’s Roadhouse (“Finnigan’s” or the
    “appellant”), on the basis that it had over-served Knox and him, thereby
    causing or contributing to the cause of the accident and his injuries.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly before trial, Finnigan’s agreed to settle liability on the basis
    that it would admit that it was “at least 1% liable” and McLean would limit his
    damages claim to a maximum of $1 million.  From the record, it is unclear
    whether  Finnigan’s admission of liability related to the accident or to
    McLean’s damages or to both matters.  It was further agreed that the trial
    would proceed to determine McLean’s damages, the degree of McLean’s contributory
    negligence in causing those damages, and Finnigan’s liability.  Knox, who was
    noted in default, would remain in the action while all of the other defendants
    would be released without costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Extensive medical evidence was required at trial, in part because of Mclean’s
    pre-existing medical situation.  McLean was born with a severe cleft palate. 
    Despite an operation when he was about 10 months old, he was left with a serious
    lifelong learning disability.  As a result of that disability, he completed
    only grade 8 and dropped out of school part way through grade 9.  His learning
    disability, together with his limited education, make it highly unlikely that
    he can be retrained for employment in “non-heavy” labour.  Prior to the
    accident, McLean had worked intermittently as both a roofer and a mover.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>Motions to Strike the
    Jury</i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the opening of trial, the plaintiff brought a motion to strike
    the jury due to the factual complexity of the medical and actuarial evidence
    and the legal complexity of the apportionment of liability issue.  The trial
    judge dismissed the motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the trial, the plaintiff brought another motion to strike the
    jury.  This motion was based on the conduct of defence counsel to that point in
    the proceedings, as well as a renewed concern about the complexity of the
    medical and actuarial issues before the jury.  This motion was also dismissed.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>The Jury Verdicts</i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a 13-day trial, the jury provided these answers (in bold) to the following questions:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Was there any negligence on the
    part of the Plaintiff Kyle McLean that caused or contributed to the injuries
    and damages he sustained as a result of the motor vehicle accident of June 4,
    2005? </p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>Yes.</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>                             …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>(a) If your answer is “Yes” to
    Question 1, what is the percentage of Kyle McLean’s contributory negligence? </p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>15%</b></p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>By what percentage, if any, should
    Kyle McLean’s contributory negligence (answer in Question 3.(a)) be reduced due
    to Finnigan’s negligence in over-serving him? </p>
  <p class=DSubquote><b>1%</b> </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>What is the net contributory
    negligence of Kyle McLean (% in 3.(a) X % in 3.(b) provided % in 3.(b) is
    greater than 0%.  If the % in 3.(b) is 0%, then insert the same % as in 3.(a))? </p>
  <p class=DSubquote><b>15%</b></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Given the deemed admission of
    liability by the Defendant Matthew Knox, and the admission by the Defendant
    Finnigan’s of 1% liability, state in percentages the degree of negligence you
    attach to each party:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>Matthew Knox:       <b>84%</b></p>
  <p class=DSubquote>Finnigan’s:            <b>1%</b></p>
  <p class=DSubquote>Mr. McLean:          <b>15% </b>(Insert answer to Question “3a” if your answer is “Yes” to Question 1.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury assessed McLean’s damages as follows:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Past income loss from June 4, 2005 until the day of trial - <b>$13,720</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life - <b>$52,600</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Future income loss - <b>$0</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Future care costs, including loss of homemaking and householder
    services -     <b>$3,000</b>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>Motion to Refrain from
    Entering the Jury Verdict on Future Income Loss</i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the jury was discharged, the plaintiff brought a motion asking the trial judge
    to refrain from entering a judgment of $0 for loss of future income, as
    determined by the jury, and to assess those damages himself instead. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge set out the law governing his power to
    intervene with the jury verdict.  He also thoroughly canvassed the</span><span
style='line-height:200%'> evidence with respect to McLean’s loss of future
    income.  Based on defence evidence alone, the trial judge concluded that as a
    result of the accident, McLean</span>: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>could no longer work as a roofer; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>at some point, should have the metal screw that had been inserted
    to hold his elbow together removed, which would require him to be off work for
    between two and four weeks; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>had lost 30-40% of the strength in his right arm; and, </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>had a 5-10% probability of developing osteoarthritis in his elbow
    that would likely be increased by heavy lifting.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge noted that the case before him was not
    a situation where there was no evidence to support the jury’s verdict of $0 for
    future income loss but, rather, that the jury’s verdict was given in the face
    of “uncontradicted” defence evidence to the contrary.  He concluded that the
    jury’s verdict on loss of future income was devoid of any evidentiary
    foundation and unsupportable in law.  He granted the motion and awarded McLean $117,200
    for loss of future income</span>.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also awarded him costs of the trial of $150,000, plus disbursements
    of $80,000 and HST.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>The Judgment</i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    judgment dated December 8, 2011 (the “Judgment”), he ordered Finnigan’s to pay
    damages of $141,378.00, plus the costs award.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finnigan’s
    raises two issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>1.  Did the
    trial judge err in refusing to enter judgment in accordance with the jury’s
    verdict on the claim for future income loss and in assessing those damages
    himself? and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>2.  Did the
    trial judge err in his costs award? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLean
    raises the following additional issues by way of cross appeal:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>3.<b>  </b>If the appeal is
    allowed, he asks that this court set aside the jury’s verdict and order a new
    trial on all issues other than Finnigan’s admitted liability, on the basis of:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(i) the improper conduct of
    defence counsel at trial, which he contends rendered the trial unfair; and/or </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(ii) the trial judge’s
    failure to strike the jury, given the complexity of the issues and defence
    counsel’s conduct at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>4.<b>  </b>If the appeal is
    dismissed, he seeks an order varying the Judgment without regard to the
    deductible under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>THE APPEAL</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>The Jury Verdict on
    Future Income Loss </i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finnigan’s
    submits that in substituting his own determination of damages for future income
    loss, the trial judge erred in two ways.  First, it contends that the trial judge
    was not entitled to disregard the jury’s verdict of $0 for that head of
    damages.  Second, it says that in any event, the trial judge did not have the power
    to substitute his own assessment of those damages.  Rather, if the trial judge
    was entitled to set aside the jury award, his only recourse was to order a
    retrial.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute as to the law that governs when a trial judge can refuse to enter
    judgment in accordance with the verdict of a jury.  At common law, a trial
    judge can disregard the answers which form the jury verdict only: (i) if there
    is no evidence to support the jury finding; or (ii) the jury gives an answer to
    a question which cannot in law provide a foundation for a judgment: see <i>Hill
    v. Church of Scientology of Toronto </i>(1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 489 (Gen. Div.), at
    p. 498, rev’d in part on other grounds (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 385 (C.A.), aff’d [1995]

style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Further, rule 52.08 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, O.Reg. 194, <i> </i>sets out certain
    conditions under which a trial judge can order that an action be retried or
    dismissed:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>52.08</b>&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Where the jury,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a) disagrees;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b) makes no finding on which judgment can be granted; or</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(c) answers some but not all of the questions directed to it
    or gives conflicting answers, so that judgment cannot be granted on its
    findings,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>the trial judge may direct that the action be retried with
    another jury at the same or any subsequent sitting, but <b><i>where there is no
    evidence on which a judgment for the plaintiff could be based or where for any
    other reason the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment, the judge shall dismiss
    the action</i></b>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, neither the common law test nor the conditions in rule 52.08 were met. 
    Consequently, the trial judge was not entitled to disregard the jury’s verdict
    on future income loss. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the common law, it cannot be said that there was no evidence to
    support the jury verdict of $0 for future income loss.  There was evidence that
    the plaintiff earned as much income, or more, following the accident as he had
    earned before the accident.  Also, the plaintiff suffered from serious credibility
    issues in respect of his income and his motivation to work.  In addition, there
    was evidence that the plaintiff had alternative job opportunities available to
    him.  For example, when asked in cross-examination about his sources of income
    in 2010, the plaintiff testified that he had done some cooking at a sports bar.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, it cannot be said that there was no evidence on which the
    jury could reject a claim for future income loss.  Even assuming that the
    defence evidence on the plaintiff’s injuries was “uncontradicted and uncontested”,
    as the trial judge found, that evidence was not determinative of the question
    of future income loss – credibility and motivation to work were also relevant
    to such a determination.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge placed significant reliance on <i>Teskey v. Toronto Transit
    Commission</i> (2003), 3 C.P.C. (6th) 181 (Ont. S.C.), a comment on that case
    is in order.  In <i>Teskey</i>, the plaintiff’s claim was for defamation and
    malicious prosecution.  The jury was instructed to assess the plaintiff’s
    damages regardless of their findings on liability.  It returned a verdict of $0
    for both torts.  The trial judge rejected those verdicts.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge overturned the jury verdict in respect of defamation because of the
    presumption that once defamation is proven, nominal damages – at a minimum -
    follow.  The jury award of $0 led her to conclude that the jury did not
    understand the instructions they had been given in respect of damages for
    defamation.  That is, she found that the jury had given an answer to a question
    which could not, in law, provide a foundation for the judgment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for damages for malicious prosecution, the trial judge in <i>Teskey </i>found
    the jury award of $0 not supportable based on the undisputed evidence of the
    plaintiff’s legal expenses incurred in defending the charges against him.  At
    para. 58 of <i>Teskey</i>, the trial judge explained that the only conclusion
    that the jury could have reached, had they understood their instructions, was
    to find damages of at least $2,140, the amount of the legal bills for which
    supporting documentation had been filed.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the trial judge stated that the ruling in <i>Teskey</i> in
    respect of damages for defamation did not apply because there is no presumption
    of damages for future income loss.  I agree.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I do not agree with the trial judge that the reasoning in <i>Teskey</i>, in
    relation to damages for malicious prosecution, is applicable to this case.  In <i>Teskey</i>,
    the plaintiff incurred legal expenses in defending the charges and he proved
    those expenses.  Had the jury understood their instructions, they would have
    been bound to have found damages of at least that amount.  A $0 award, in those
    circumstances, was not sustainable.  In the present case, however, there is no
    certainty that McLean would suffer future income loss.  As already explained, the
    jury had to decide that question based on not only the medical and other expert
    evidence but also on McLean’s work history and credibility.        </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    to the extent that the trial judge’s determination in this case was implicitly
    based on the view that the jury’s verdict on future income loss was
    unreasonable or perverse, as distinct from lacking an evidentiary foundation, I
    note that the issue of an unreasonable or perverse verdict is a matter for the
    appellate court: see <i>Lang v. McKenna</i> (2000), 135 O.A.C. 304 (C.A.), at
    para. 24, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 539. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for rule 52.08(1), it is readily apparent that none of the conditions set out
    in (a) to (c) were in play.  And, for the reasons already given, it cannot be said
    that there was no evidence on which to base the jury verdict of $0 for future
    income loss.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that the trial judge erred in setting aside the jury’s verdict on damages
    for future income loss, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the trial
    judge had the power to substitute his own assessment of damages for future
    income loss.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing
    in the foregoing reasons should be taken as approving the trial judge’s
    decision to set aside the jury verdict on damages for malicious prosecution in <i>Teskey</i> or to substitute her assessment of those damages.         </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>The Costs Award at Trial</i></b> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finnigan’s
    says that the trial judge erred in not ordering some costs of the trial in its
    favour.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave detailed reasons for the costs award.  He considered the
    factors set out in Rule 57 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, including: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the complexity and importance of the matter; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the amounts that the plaintiff had claimed versus the amounts
    that the jury awarded; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the defendants’ collective offer to settle, dated January 26,
    2011, and Finnigan’s offer to settle, dated September 14, 2011, neither of
    which – as the trial judge correctly found – qualified as a rule 49.10 offer; and,</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the conduct of defence counsel, which the trial judge described
    as being “on the edge” and which necessitated numerous correcting instructions
    to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also fairly reduced the costs awarded to reflect the plaintiff’s unsuccessful
    motions to strike the jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the trial judge noted that Finnigan’s was represented by experienced counsel
    who had not filed a costs outline, as required by rule 57.01(6), and who did
    not submit that the costs claimed by the plaintiff were beyond what the
    unsuccessful party would reasonably have expected to pay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff was successful at trial.   There was no rule 49.10 offer.  He is
    presumptively entitled to his costs unless there are special circumstances to
    deprive him of costs.  The trial judge found that no such circumstances
    existed.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    factoring in the result of the appeal, I see no basis on which to interfere
    with the costs award.  The amount of the <span style='line-height:200%'>plaintiff’s
    damages was but one factor in the trial judge’s exercise of discretion. 
    Furthermore, while the outcome of this appeal is to set aside th</span>e trial
    judge’s substituted assessment of damages for future income loss, the full
    effect of that is diminished by the partial success that McLean enjoys in
    respect of the cross appeal, as explained below.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>THE CROSS APPEAL</b> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    will be recalled that the cross appeal was framed in the alternative, depending
    upon whether the appeal was allowed.  Because I would allow the appeal in part,
    I must address the first of the two issues raised by way of cross appeal,
    namely, whether the trial judge erred in refusing to strike the jury because of
    improper conduct by defence counsel at trial or the complexity of the matters
    in issue.  In addition, however, in its supplementary notice of cross appeal, the
    respondent (cross appellant) raised the issue of the validity of the jury
    questions on the apportionment of liability.  As both parties made submissions
    on this issue and it bears on the primary question on the cross appeal of
    whether a new trial ought to be ordered, this issue must also be addressed.       </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>The Trial Judge’s Refusal
    to Strike the Jury</i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff set out numerous instances of alleged improper conduct by defence
    counsel at the trial, including breaches of agreements between counsel,
    ignoring court directions on the use of evidence, improperly attacking the
    evidence of the plaintiff’s experts, misstating the law and evidence in
    addresses to the jury, and making misleading statements before the jury. He
    points out that defence counsel has been chastised for behaviour of this type
    in prior jury trials:  see <i>Jordan v. Hall</i> (1987), 17 C.P.C. (2d) 285
    (Ont. Dist. Ct.), at pp. 286-88; and <i>Typis </i>(<i>Litigation Guardian of</i>) <i>v. Lavigne</i> (2009), 73 C.P.C. (6th) 346 (Ont. S. C.), at paras. 6 and 22.
    He contends that the trial judge’s finding that there was no evidence to
    support the jury verdict on future income loss supports his position that
    defence counsel’s conduct was so serious that it undermined the fairness of the
    trial and puts into doubt the validity and fairness of the jury’s verdict.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am unable to accede to the plaintiff’s submission that a new trial must be
    ordered on all issues other than Finnigan’s admitted liability.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge twice considered the plaintiff’s allegations of improper defence
    conduct, once in the middle of the trial and again after the jury rendered its
    verdicts.  When the trial judge dismissed the plaintiff’s midtrial motion to
    strike the jury because of defence counsel’s conduct (coupled with the factual
    and legal complexity of the issues), he was fully aware of defence counsel’s
    conduct to that point in the proceedings.  The trial judge again considered the
    issue of defence counsel’s conduct when deciding costs. At that point, the
    trial judge had both observed the entire trial and received the jury verdicts
    on damages.  He stated that although defence counsel’s conduct required a
    number of correcting instructions, “was pushing the boundaries” and “on the
    edge”, it was not “so extreme” as to be a major factor in deciding costs.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    trial judge was in the best position to assess the impugned conduct and whether
    it impaired trial fairness.  In his view, the conduct was not so egregious as
    to require that the jury be struck or that costs sanctions be imposed.  Considerable
    deference is owed by this court to that assessment:  see <i>Groen v. Harris, </i>2010
    ONCA 621, at para. 9.  I see no basis on which to overturn that
    assessment.      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>As for the contention that the complexity of the case
    warranted the striking of the jury, I see no basis for interfering with the
    trial judge’s exercise of discretion in refusing to do so.  The trial judge was
    guided by the legal principle that the substantive right to a trial by jury is
    not to be interfered with, absent just cause: see <i>Graham v. Rourke </i>(1990),
    75 O.R. (2d) 622 (C.A.), at p. 625.  He fully considered the matter but was
    satisfied that the case was not too complex for a jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span

    Supreme Court of Canada established the principle of commercial host
    responsibility in <i>Jordan House Ltd. v. Menow, </i>[1974] S.C.R. 239.  In <i>Jordan
    House</i>, a patron drank alcohol at a hotel, to the point of intoxication. 
    After being ejected from the hotel, the patron was struck by a car while
    walking on the highway.  The Supreme Court held that the hotel, having served
    the patron to the point of intoxication, had a common law duty to see that he

    responsible, according to the degree of fault found against it. <i> </i></p>

    commercial host responsibility in a case remarkably similar to the present
    appeal.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Pilon #1</i>, two people were drinking together at a tavern.  They were injured
    in an ensuing motor vehicle accident.  The injured passenger sued both the driver
    of the vehicle and the tavern.  The defendant tavern admitted that it, along
    with the other defendants, was liable for the accident.  However, it did not
    accept responsibility for the plaintiff’s injuries, in part because the
    plaintiff had “willingly” accepted a ride when he knew or ought to have known
    the driver was impaired.  The tavern argued that it was not necessary for the
    jury to apportion fault for the damages among the defendants or to quantify the
    tavern’s responsibility for over-serving the plaintiff.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted the tavern’s contention, with the result that the jury was
    instructed to quantify only the plaintiff’s damages and his degree of contributory
    negligence.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, this court concluded that the jury had failed to fully perform its
    apportionment functions, saying at para. 28 of <i>Pilon #1</i>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]wo aspects of the tavern’s liability should have been
    identified for the jury:  liability for causing or contributing to the accident
    by its negligent conduct toward the driver, and liability for causing or
    contributing to the damage by its negligent conduct toward the [passenger].  The
    jury should have been asked to apportion the degree of fault for each aspect of
    the liability of the tavern separately, along with the liability of each of the
    other respondents for the accident and for the damage and of the appellant for
    the damage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the court also noted in <i>Pilon #1</i>, at para. 27, ss. 3 and 6 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, as amended, require the apportionment of fault
    among the parties in situations of contributory negligence.  Those sections
    read as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. In any action for damages that is founded upon the fault or
    negligence of the defendant if fault or negligence is found on the part of the
    plaintiff that contributed to the damages, the court shall apportion the
    damages in proportion to the degree of fault or negligence found against the
    parties respectively.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>6. In any action tried with a jury, the degree of fault or
    negligence of the respective parties is a question of fact for the jury.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>                   <b>ii.  Application to the Present Case</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have already mentioned, the present case is remarkably similar to <i>Pilon #1</i>. 
    As in <i>Pilon #1</i>, the plaintiff and the driver of the car were drinking at
    a bar before the accident and the plaintiff sued both the driver and the bar for
    the injuries he suffered as a result of the accident.  Just as in <i>Pilon #1</i>,
    the bar that had been serving the plaintiff and the driver – in this case, Finnigan’s
    – defended the action on the basis that the plaintiff had been a “willing”
    passenger in a car driven by a person he knew, or ought to have known, was
    intoxicated.  And, just as in <i>Pilon #1</i>, the trial judge accepted the
    bar’s contention that there was no need for the jury to separately apportion
    liability for the accident between the driver of the car and the bar.  This
    court found that to be an error in <i>Pilon #1 </i>and it was an error in this
    case as well.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    28 of <i>Pilon #1 </i>(set out above) makes it clear that the jury should have
    been instructed to determine Finnigan’s liability for: (1) causing or
    contributing to the accident, by its negligent conduct toward Knox, and (2) causing
    or contributing to the damages that McLean suffered, by its negligent conduct
    toward each of Knox and McLean.  The first was not done at all and, as I
    explain below, the second was done incorrectly.       </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not blind adherence to precedent that leads me to conclude that it was an
    error to fail to follow the dictates of <i>Pilon #1</i>.  Apportionment of
    liability is a difficult area of the law.  For the jury to properly discharge
    its task of apportioning liability, the jurors need to clearly understand the
    differences between liability for the accident and liability for the
    plaintiff’s damages.  This clarity begins by having the jury approach the two
    matters sequentially and in that order:  (1) apportionment of liability for the
    accident, and then (2) apportionment of liability for the plaintiff’s damages. 
      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    apportioning liability for the accident, the jury had to consider only two
    parties:  Knox, as the driver of the car, and Finnigan’s, for having over-served
    him.  On the facts of this case, only those two parties caused or contributed
    to the accident.  Accordingly, no fault could be attributed to the plaintiff for
    the accident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    apportioning liability for the damages that McLean suffered as a result of the
    accident, however, the jury had to decide what degree of fault to attribute to
    each of Knox, the plaintiff, and Finnigan’s.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Knox’s
    liability for McLean’s damages flows from his role as driver of the car.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff’s liability (contributory negligence) for his damages flows from
    having “willingly” accepted a ride with Knox when he knew, or reasonably ought
    to have known, that Knox was impaired and that he might suffer injury as a
    result of being a passenger in a car driven by an impaired driver.  In
    determining the plaintiff’s liability, the jury must consider the plaintiff’s
    appreciation of the risk he took in becoming a passenger in the car.  But, a
    passenger’s “willingness” to accept a ride with an impaired driver may arise in
    part because he or she was drunk.  If that drunkenness was caused in part by
    the commercial host, the commercial host could be found to share responsibility
    for the passenger’s actions: see <i>Pilon #1</i>, at para. 24.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    Finnigan’s liability for McLean’s damages flows from two separate things:  
    over-serving Knox and over-serving the plaintiff.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    advantage of requiring the jury to quantify liability for the accident and for
    damages separately and sequentially is evident.  The jury’s assessment of a
    commercial host’s liability for the accident will necessarily inform its
    apportionment of liability for damages.  As this court noted in <i>Pilon v.
    Janveaux</i> (2006), 211 O.A.C. 19 (C.A.) (“<i>Pilon #2</i>”)<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
    at para. 12, the degree of the commercial host’s responsibility for allowing
    the driver to become impaired, as a matter of logic, will normally be similar to
    the degree of the commercial host’s responsibility for allowing the passenger
    to become impaired.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not to suggest that the jury must necessarily ascribe the same level of
    responsibility to the commercial host for the accident as for the plaintiff’s
    damages in every case.  After all, the evidence may show any number of
    differences between the passenger and driver, such as how much they weighed,
    what they had consumed before they got to the bar, and the quantity and type of
    alcohol that the two consumed while at the bar. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    what this sentence does highlight is the relationship between the two apportionment
    issues.  In considering the commercial host’s liability for the accident, the
    jury will have to make findings about, among other things, the amount that it
    served the driver and over what period of time.  Where the driver and passenger
    were drinking together at the bar, those findings will be relevant when the
    jury considers how much the commercial host served the passenger and over what
    period of time, considerations critical to the jury’s apportionment of
    liability for the passenger’s damages.  As explained above, the degree to which
    the commercial host over-served the passenger is relevant to the apportionment
    of liability for the passenger’s damages.  Thus, the jury’s findings on the
    issue of liability for the accident will inevitably influence its allocation of
    both aspects of the commercial host’s liability for the passenger’s damages,
    flowing from having over-served the driver and from having over-served the
    passenger. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>iii.  Errors in the Jury
    Questions</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons given, the jury should have been asked: (1) to apportion liability
    for causing or contributing to the accident between the driver, for driving
    while intoxicated, and the commercial host, for over-serving the driver: and
    (2) to apportion liability for causing or contributing to the plaintiff’s
    damages among the driver, for driving while intoxicated, the plaintiff, for
    accepting a ride from the intoxicated driver, and the commercial host, for
    over-serving both the driver and the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury was not asked to apportion liability for the accident.  As I have
    explained, in light of <i>Pilon #1</i> that failure was an error.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the apportionment of liability for the plaintiff’s damages, while
    the intent of the jury questions was to have the jury allocate responsibility among
    Knox, Finnigan’s, and the plaintiff, in my view, the questions are defective.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    counsel for Finnigan’s acknowledged at the oral hearing of the appeal that
    Question 3(c) cannot be correct, no more need be said about it.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Question
    4 is the most significant of the questions, as it requires an allocation of
    responsibility among Knox, Finnigan’s, and the plaintiff.  It asked the jury to
    state in percentages the degree of negligence that it attached to each party,
    “[g]iven the deemed admission of liability by the Defendant Matthew Knox, and
    the admission by the Defendant Finnigan’s of 1% liability”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    question is simply wrong.  It is explicitly premised on Finnigan’s having
    admitted 1% liability whereas Finnigan’s admitted <b>at least </b>1%
    liability.  The embedded assumption completely undermined the primary task of
    the jury, which was to determine the respective degrees of responsibility for
    the plaintiff’s damages.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is further wrong as it does not direct the jury to apportion Finnigan’s
    liability for the plaintiff’s damages flowing from having over-served Knox and
    from having over-served McLean. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add that the questions were in breach of the agreement between the
    plaintiff and Finnigan’s, entered into before trial, in which Finnigan’s agreed
    to admit that it was at least 1%<b> </b>liable and that its further liability would
    be determined at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finnigan’s
    argues that the jury instructions cure any errors in the jury questions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  In my view, the instructions replicate the errors in the jury
    questions.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Page
    1291 of the trial transcript shows the trial judge instructing the jury both that
    Finnigan’s had admitted responsibility for “at least” 1% of McLean’s damages (line
    2) and that it had admitted responsibility for 1% of those damages (lines 13-15). 
    The two cannot stand together.  Whether Finnigan’s was 1% liable or more than
    1% liable for McLean’s damages was a critical matter for the jury when deciding
    apportionment on the issue of liability for McLean’s damages.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And,
    at p. 1294 of the transcript, lines 11 -12, the trial judge appears to take
    away the task of apportioning liability between Knox and Finnigan’s from the
    jury:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>[T]he acts
    or omissions of two or more persons may work concurrently as the effective cause
    of the injury, and in such a case, each of the participating acts or omissions
    is regarded in law as a proximate cause, and if you find that to be the case,
    you must apportion the degrees of negligence between the parties responsible.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>Finnigan’s has
    admitted that it is at least one per cent responsible for causing the injuries
    suffered by [McLean] by over-serving Knox and Knox is deemed to have admitted
    that his driving at an excessive speed while impaired was a proximate cause of [McLean’s]
    injuries.  As a result, <b>you do not have to decide this issue as it has been
    admitted.</b>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
    in context, this instruction appears to tell the jury that they need not decide
    the respective degrees of fault of Knox and Finnigan’s.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the trial judge never explicitly instructed the jury on how Finnigan’s
    liability for McLean’s damages could flow both from over-serving Knox and from
    over-serving the plaintiff.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in a number of places in the instructions, the trial judge mixes liability
    between the tortfeasors for causing the accident with issues surrounding
    McLean’s contributory negligence, thereby lumping the victim in with the
    tortfeasors, and confusing the very issues the jury was to decide.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, as a result of the errors in the jury questions, coupled with the
    flaws in the jury instructions, I have serious doubt as to the validity of the
    jury verdicts on the apportionment of liability for the plaintiff’s damages.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>iv.  The Remedy</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff argues that in light of the errors in the jury questions, a new trial
    should be ordered on everything except Finnigan’s admitted liability.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not accede to this submission.  As I have mentioned, this case is very
    similar to <i>Pilon #1</i>.  In <i>Pilon #1</i>, this court found that the
    legal errors in the jury instructions would normally result in a new trial
    being ordered.  However, it declined to order a new trial and, instead, decided
    the issue of apportionment itself.  In refusing to order a new trial, the court
    considered the amount of time that had passed since the accident, the length of
    the original trial, and the costs involved in a new trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    same considerations apply to the present case.  The accident in this case took
    place in 2005.  It is now 2013.  Memories will be stale.  The trial took place
    over 13 days and involved extensive medical evidence.  The costs involved in a
    new trial would be very significant.  Those costs must be considered alongside
    the very modest amounts that the jury awarded for damages.  Apart from the
    amount that the jury awarded for future income loss, there was no real
    challenge to those awards.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    new trial in a civil case will only be ordered when the interests of justice
    plainly require it:  see <i>Fiddler v. Chiavetti</i>, 2010 ONCA 210, 317 D.L.R.
    (4th) 385, at para. 9.  For the reasons given, the interests of justice augur
    against ordering a new trial.  Instead, this court should perform the
    apportionment task that the jury ought to have been instructed to perform.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the parties are unable to resolve the apportionment issues, they may make brief
    written submissions, not to exceed eight pages, within fifteen days of the date
    of release of these reasons, on the issue of the apportionment of liability for
    the plaintiff’s damages.  In those submissions, the parties should address the impact
    of any purported apportionment on the statutory deductible.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    regard to the statutory deductible, I recognize that the plaintiff raised this
    issue in its cross appeal and that I have not dealt with it in these reasons.  I
    have not done so because the issue of the deductible was framed as a matter to
    be dealt with if the appeal failed.  Because I would allow the appeal in part,
    the precondition to dealing with the issue was not met.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the issues of apportionment of liability for the plaintiff’s damages and
    apportionment for the deductible are interrelated.  Thus, it is necessary to
    hear from the parties on both matters.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making submissions on the apportionment of liability and the impact on the
    statutory deductible, I would invite the parties to consider addressing the
    following two matters in their submissions.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first relates to the trial judge’s handling of Finnigan’s liability for the
    deductible.  In this regard, the parties should address the correctness of the trial
    judge’s proposed method of handling this matter, particularly in light of this
    court’s decision in <i>Sullivan Estate v. Bond </i>(2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 97. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second relates to the matter of waiver.  Without deciding the matter, in light
    of the mandatory language of s. 267.5(7) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, it may be
    that waiver, in the strict sense of the word, is not available.  Nonetheless,
    defence counsel’s conduct may be relevant to a determination of its liability
    for the statutory deductible. Counsel may wish to address this consideration
    and how it impacts on the apportionment of liability for the statutory
    deductible.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><b>DISPOSITION</b> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal in part and vary the Judgment to provide $0 for future
    income loss.  I would make no change to the costs award at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the cross appeal in part and determine the apportionment of
    liability for the plaintiff’s damages in accordance with the resolution of that
    issue by the parties, failing which, following receipt of their written
    submissions on this matter, in accordance with the directions set out above.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Success
    being divided on appeal and cross appeal, I would make no order as to costs of
    the appeal and cross appeal.</p>
