  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent, quite properly, acknowledges that the trial
    judge made legal errors in his reasons for judgment.  She argues that the
    errors do not justify quashing the acquittals entered at trial.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are four counts that are relevant on this appeal.  Count 1, a
    charge of luring, involves communications between the 21 year-old respondent
    and the 15 year-old complainant over the internet.  Counts 2, 3 and 4 involve
    an incident that occurred when the complainant and the respondent met in person
    for the first time.  This meeting occurred at the respondents home.  The
    complainant alleges that she was sexually assaulted.  The respondent maintained
    that the sexual activity was consensual.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents defence on count 1 was that he believed the complainant
    was 16 years of age.  He argued that he had taken reasonable steps to determine
    the age of the complainant as required under s. 172.1(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. 
    The respondent testified that the complainant told him that she was 16 years of
    age.  He also testified that because he doubted the veracity of much of what
    she said, he contacted her using an alternate internet profile.  In the course
    of conversations with the alternative internet profile Jerome, the
    complainant indicated that she was 16 years of age.  The complainant
    acknowledged that she told Jerome she was 16 years of age.  She also
    testified that she told the respondent she was 15 years of age.  The difference
    is, of course, crucial in that 16 years of age is the demarcation for the
    purposes of criminal liability under this section.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents defence on counts 2, 3 and 4 was first that he believed
    the complainant was 16 years of age and, therefore, capable in law of
    consenting to the sexual activity.  He took the position that he took all
    reasonable steps as required under s. 150.1(4) to determine the complainants
    age.  Second, the respondent took the position that the complainant in fact
    consented to the sexual activity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judges reasons acquitting the respondent on the four charges
    are very brief and, in some respects, unclear.  In respect of count 1, the
    trial judge made no reference to s. 172.1(4).  He did refer to the Jerome
    evidence, but did so in the context of the respondents belief as to the
    complainants age when he engaged in sexual activity with her at his home.  The
    trial judges reference to that evidence of the respondents belief concerning
    the complainants age is found at p. 488:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Now in these circumstances, the steps he took are perhaps idiosyncratic,
    making up yet another alter ego and asking her how old she was, but given what
    hes been told and <span class=Underline>also considering the fact that he
    himself is rather unsophisticated and immature, Im trying to put it
    diplomatically,</span> I think he has discharged the onus on him to raise a
    reasonable doubt as to his entitlement to the defence in accordance with the
    terms of s. 150.1(4).  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The inquiry described in the above passage is neither the contextual nor
    the objective inquiry mandated under s. 172.1(4).  We cannot take a reference
    by the trial judge made in the context of a consideration of the respondents
    belief at the time of the alleged sexual activity and apply it as if it were an
    inquiry into the respondents state of mind in respect of count 1.  The trial
    judge failed to make the inquiry required under s. 172.1(4) as it related to
    the internet contact and he failed to address the reasonable steps test in
    the context of the entirety of the evidence relevant to the internet luring
    charge.  The acquittal on count 1 must be quashed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On counts 2, 3 and 4, the trial judge appeared to accept that the
    accused had taken all reasonable steps to determine the complainants age as
    required under s. 150.1(4).  Although the trial judge misstated the test as
    requiring only the taking of reasonable steps and not all reasonable steps.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judges analysis of the reasonableness of the steps taken by
    the respondent to determine the complainants age focussed exclusively on the
    respondents internet contact with the complainant using the name Jerome. 
    The trial judge did not consider any of the other factors relevant to the all
    reasonable steps inquiry that existed at the time of the sexual activity alleged
    in counts 2, 3 and 4.  When that activity occurred, the respondent and the
    complainant were together.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not refer, for example, to the evidence of the complainants physical
    appearance or the evidence of the obvious reluctance of the complainant to
    engage in the sexual activity contemplated by the respondent.  This evidence
    and other possible visual clues were relevant to whether the respondent, when
    he met the complainant, took all reasonable steps to determine whether the
    complainant was 16 years of age before engaging in sexual activity with her.  The
    trial judges failure to consider any of these factors constitutes a failure to
    engage in the contextual analysis required under s. 150.1(4) and amounts to an
    error in law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a second problem with the trial judges acquittal on the sexual assault
    charge (count 4).  His reasons relating to that count are so inadequate as to
    constitute legal error apart from the failure to properly address s. 150.1(4).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the respondent gained the advantage of s. 150.1(4), the trial judge still
    had to consider whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    respondent did not reasonably believe that the complainant had consented:  see <em>Criminal
    Code</em> s. 273.2.  A reasonable belief that the complainant was 16 is not a defence
    to a charge of sexual assault.  Rather, it opens the door to a defence based on
    the Crowns failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not
    reasonably believe that the complainant was consenting to the sexual activity.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was common ground that the complainant initially expressly refused to engage in
    the sexual activity sought by the respondent when she arrived at his home.  It
    was common ground that they argued and the argument became somewhat
    vociferous.  It was common ground that at some point after the complainant had
    been in the respondents home for four or five hours she fled the home.  It was
    common ground that she had some significant physical injuries when she left the
    home.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the face of all of that evidence, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to
    expressly deal with the concepts of consent delineated in ss. 265(3) and 273.1
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  The trial judge had to make the findings of
    fact made relevant by those provisions which speak to the issue of consent in
    situations like the one that existed here.  Instead, the trial judge said only I
    do not believe he [the respondent] forced sexual conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    finding that the sexual conduct was not forced was not enough to determine
    whether, apart from the question of the complainants age, there was a
    potentially operative consent.  The question of whether the complainant gave a
    genuine operative consent was crucial to the ultimate question of whether the
    Crown had proved that the respondent did not reasonably believe that she had
    consented.  It was the respondents position that he held that reasonable
    belief because she had in fact consented, although as it turned out, she was incapable
    of doing so given her true age.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge failed to address this issue in any meaningful way in his reasons. 
    Effective appellate review of this part of his judgment is impossible.</p>

    Crown suggests this court can enter convictions.  We cannot agree with that
    submission.  The trial judges findings are not such as to permit this court to
    quash the acquittals and enter convictions.  In our view, the Crown is entitled
    to a new trial.  We would quash the acquittals on counts 1 through 4 and direct
    a new trial on those counts.   </p>
