    J.A</span></strong><strong><span style='font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
font-weight:normal'>.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Global Pharmacy Canada is the trade name of a business that uses the
    internet to market the retail sale of generic prescription drugs to Americans. 
    Although the seller of the drugs is now a Belize company, on its website, the
    seller refers to itself as Global Pharmacy Canada and directs customers to
    contact its “dedicated staff of friendly customer service agents located in
    Toronto, Canada”.  The “dedicated staff” is actually located in a call centre
    in Mississauga, Ontario.  They take the customer orders and process payments
    for the drugs.  They also ensure that the orders are filled in India and
    shipped directly to the customers.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Advertising is done through the internet and directly through
    promotional materials distributed in the United States.  The customers are
    American.  The drugs are sourced in India and never enter Canada.  The
    corporations and individuals involved in operating Global Pharmacy Canada are
    scattered among Belize, the United States and Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are those companies and individuals subject to the jurisdiction of the
    Ontario College of Pharmacists?  Are retail prescription drugs being sold in
    Ontario in breach of the legislation that governs pharmacies and pharmacists?  These
    appeals depend on answers to those challenging questions.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario legislation closely regulates the retail sale of prescription
    drugs in Ontario.  The Ontario College of Pharmacists (the “College”) is
    entrusted with policing violations of the legislation.  In carrying out its
    legislative objects, the College has a duty to serve and protect the public
    interest.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the College first started an action in which it
    alleged that the appellants were in breach of various statutory provisions
    regulating the sale of prescription drugs in Ontario.  The core allegations are
    that the appellants have been:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>operating a pharmacy without accreditation;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>using certain designated terms, such as “pharmacy”,
    “pharmacists”, “drug” and “drugs” in connection with their business, which is
    not an accredited pharmacy, and by persons who are not pharmacists; </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>performing acts reserved to pharmacists and accredited
    pharmacies; and,</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>selling prescription drugs in a pharmacy, without pharmacists,
    and without complying with the rigors required for the sale of prescription
    drugs, such as the requirement of a valid prescription.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of the appellants are authorized to sell prescription drugs in
    Ontario.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The College then brought an application to stop the appellants from
    selling, by retail, prescription drugs from any location in Ontario, and to
    cease using the designated terms “pharmacy,” “pharmacist”, “drug”, or “drugs”
    in relation to their business.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By judgment dated March 15, 2013 (the “Judgment” or the “injunction
    order”), the application judge granted the injunction until the appellants
    could demonstrate that they were in compliance with the governing legislation. 
    She concluded that the sale of prescription drugs takes place in Ontario and
    that the appellants are subject to the College’s jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two groups of appellants appeal the injunction order, arguing that the
    application judge erred in both of her conclusions.  The first group is RX
    Processing Services Inc. (“RXP”), Richard Petko and Frank Stacho (the “RXP
    appellants”).  The second group is GPC-Belize, David Billings and Wade Onuffer
    (the “GPC-Belize appellants”).  GPC-Belize is a Belize corporation carrying on
    business as Global Pharmacy Canada Inc.             </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK </p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBold>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    regulatory scheme under which these proceedings have been brought provides
    important context for these appeals.</p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBold>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    Ontario statutes, taken together, closely regulate pharmacists, pharmacies, and
    the retail sale of prescription drugs in Ontario: the <em>Pharmacy Act</em>,
    1991, S.O. 1991, c. 36 (“<em>PA</em>”); the <em>Drug and Pharmacies Regulation
    Act,</em> R.S.O. 1990, c. H.4 (the “<em>DPRA</em>”); and the <em>Regulated
    Health Professions Act</em>, 1991, S.O. 1991, c. 18 (“<em>RHPA</em>”).  The <em>Health
    Professions Procedural Code </em>(the “Code”), which is Schedule 2 to the <em>RHPA</em> and is also incorporated into the <em>PA</em>, and the regulations under these
    statutes are also part of the statutory scheme.   </p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBold>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sale of prescription drugs in Ontario is highly regulated.  For example, all
    pharmacies – meaning all premises from which drugs are sold by retail – must be
    accredited: see ss. 1(1) and 139, <em>DPRA</em>.  Only a registered pharmacist
    can own or operate a pharmacy: see ss. 142 and 144, <em>DPRA</em>.  Further,
    drugs can only be sold by certain qualified individuals under specific
    conditions: see ss. 27(1) and 27(2)(8), <em>RHPA</em>; <em>s. 149, DPRA.</em></p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBoldItalic>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    College is tasked with the regulation of drugs and pharmacies in accordance
    with the <em>DPRA</em>: see s. 6, <em>PA</em>.  It is also responsible for
    regulating the practice of the pharmacy profession and governing its members in
    accordance with the <em>RHPA</em>, the <em>PA</em>, the Code, and any
    regulations passed thereunder: see s. 3(1), the Code. This includes the
    establishment, development and maintenance of standards of practice,
    professional ethics, and qualifications required of those operating pharmacies
    and acting as pharmacists within the province: see s. 3(1), the Code; s. 6, <em>PA</em>. 
    In carrying out its legislative objects, the College is required to serve and
    protect the public interest: see s. 3(2), the Code.  </p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBoldItalic>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    College alleges that the appellants, in violation of various provisions of the
    applicable legislation:  </p>

    College is expressly authorized under s. 162 of the <em>DPRA</em> and s. 87 of

    the applicable legislation and to compel compliance, as it did in this case.  </p>

  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND IN BRIEF</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following factual background draws heavily from the thorough reasons of the
    application judge.     </p>
  <p class=Heading>          <i>Before the Restructuring</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    2007 to 2009, Global Pharmacy Canada advertised prescription drugs for sale
    worldwide, including in Ontario, via the website www.globalpharmacycanada.com. 
    The business was operated by 17245665 Ontario Inc. c.o.b. as Global Pharmacy
    Canada Inc. (“GPC-Ontario”).  GPC-Ontario operated out of a call centre in
    Mississauga, Ontario.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GPC-Ontario
    was owned by Petko and Stacho.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the summer of 2009, the College received three complaints or inquiries about
    Global Pharmacy Canada.  One, from an American, complained that Global Pharmacy
    Canada “should not be allowed to prey on U.S. citizens”.  The second was from
    the California Board of Pharmacy, which inquired whether Global Pharmacy Canada
    was licensed with the College.  The third was from a director of the Centre for
    Pharmacoeconomic Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, who suggested
    that Global Pharmacy Canada’s promotional material was “very deceptive”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    complaints and inquiries precipitated an investigation by the College,
    beginning in July 2009.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    August 2009 and November 2012, the College received further complaints from two
    Americans and an inquiry from the Director of the Montana Board of Pharmacy.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    June 2010, Health Canada expressed concerns to Global Pharmacy Canada about its
    advertising and sale of drugs that were not approved for use in Canada,
    contrary to the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27 (“<i>FDA</i>“),
    and its regulations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted that the appellants conceded that from 2007 until they restructured
    their affairs in 2009 and 2010: (1) the College had jurisdiction to regulate
    GPC-Ontario’s activities; (2) generic drugs originating in India were being
    sold by an Ontario corporation to Ontario residents; and, (3) they were in
    breach of the applicable legislative provisions because prescription drugs were
    being sold in Ontario and none of the employees at the call centre were
    pharmacists.</p>
  <p class=Heading>          <em>The Restructuring</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2009-10, GPC-Ontario reorganized its corporate structure and operations in a
    way that the appellants claim removed it from the ambit of the College’s
    regulation. Details of the restructuring are set out below but, in summary, it
    consisted of three things.  GPC-Ontario sold its tangible assets to RXP and its
    intangible assets to GPC-Belize.  Steps were taken so that no Canadians could
    directly buy drugs from Global Pharmacy Canada.  And, the Global Pharmacy
    Canada website was changed.       </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><u>The Corporate Changes</u></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May 2009, GPC-Ontario sold all of its tangible assets for approximately $41,000
    to RXP, a recently incorporated Ontario company.  The tangible assets consisted
    of all property located at its call centre in Mississauga, including network
    infrastructure and software licenses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RXP
    now runs the call and processing centre in Mississauga in essentially the same
    manner as GPC-Ontario ran it prior to the restructuring.  It employs
    approximately 17 staff and one manager, Bruno D’Adderio.  It operates from the
    same location and with many of the same employees as prior to the restructuring.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petko
    and Stacho are RXP’s sole shareholders and directors.  It will be recalled that
    they are the same people who owned GPC-Ontario prior to the restructuring.      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 2010, GPC-Ontario sold all of its intangible assets for $120,000 to GPC-Belize. 
    The sale included its website, domain name, the “Global Pharmacy Canada” name,
    logos, trademarks, the customer database, and all advertising and marketing
    collateral.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants have made no disclosure as to the identity of the shareholders and
    directors of GPC-Belize.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GPC-Belize
    describes Billings and Onuffer as individuals “associated with” it.  Both
    Billings and Onuffer are residents of Pennsylvania.    Billings is GPC-Belize’s
    Chief Financial Officer.  He signed the agreements on behalf of GPC-Belize with
    respect to its purchase of GPC-Ontario’s intangible assets.  Onuffer’s name
    appears in two of Global Pharmacy Canada’s press releases. In one, Onuffer is
    referred to as “Mr. Wade Onuffer of globalpharmacycanada.com”, and is quoted
    extensively.  In the other, he is referred to as a pharmacist and an “expert
    from Global Pharmacy Canada”.  Before the application judge, Onuffer’s counsel
    acknowledged that he is not a pharmacist.           </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petko
    swore an affidavit disclosing some, but not all, of the documentation and facts
    about GPC-Ontario’s sales to RXP and GPC-Belize, and the corporate
    restructuring.  He deposed that GPC-Ontario and GPC-Belize entered into an
    exclusive licensing agreement at the same time as GPC-Ontario and RXP entered
    into the May 2009 asset purchase agreement.  However, details of the exclusive
    licensing agreement are unknown because that agreement has not been disclosed. 
    Petko deposed that he was unable to locate that agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of GPC-Belize, Billings or Onuffer filed any materials on the application.  Instead,
    they relied on submissions made by counsel for RXP, Petko and Stacho.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to a Payment Processing Services Agreement dated January 2010, GPC-Ontario
    continued to perform banking functions for GPC-Belize after the sale of its
    intangible assets to it.  On behalf of GPC-Belize, GPC-Ontario deposited
    cheques and money orders made payable to Global Pharmacy Canada Inc. into its own
    bank account.  Petko was the signing officer.  Thousands of dollars were
    deposited each day, and sometimes twice a day.  Periodically, GPC-Ontario sent
    the accumulated funds, by wire transfer, to GPC-Belize, less the agreed-upon 3%
    fee.  The application judge described the arrangement as a “clear commingling”
    of funds.  GPC-Belize cancelled this banking arrangement in January 2013,
    during the proceeding below.  No reasons were given for the cancellation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GPC-Belize
    and RXP entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “Agreement”), effective
    August 1, 2010, under which RXP provides call centre services for GPC-Belize. 
    The Agreement states that RXP is to provide “customer relations and
    administrative services” in connection with GPC-Belize’s “pharmacy intermediary
    activities”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span

    details of the relationships among the various individuals and corporate
    entities emerge below.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><u>The Operational Changes</u></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the corporate restructuring, measures were taken to address the
    issue of sales of the prescription drugs to Canadians.  A block was put on the
    website so that Canadian residents could not access it from a Canadian IP
    address.  Steps were taken so that any drugs purchased would not be shipped to
    a Canadian address.  The cumulative effect of these measures is that Canadians
    can now only acquire the pharmaceutical drugs being sold by the appellants by
    using a web proxy service to hide their residency and having the drugs
    delivered to another country.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Global Pharmacy Canada website has also changed since the College began its
    investigation into the appellants’ activities.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    August 2010 – some eight months after the sale from GPC-Ontario to GPC-Belize –
    the website continued to describe Global Pharmacy Canada as a “Canadian
    pharmacy company headquartered in Toronto, Canada”.  In a section entitled
    “About Us”, there is a photo of the individuals who work at the “Global
    Pharmacy Canada customer service department located in Mississauga, Canada”. 
    The text below read: “Since 2004, our office in Toronto, Canada has been
    helping residents of the United States place orders and receive deliveries…”.  The
    customer order form, available for download on the website, featured a red
    maple leaf and the Canadian flag.  Apart from the website, the only point of
    contact that customers had with Global Pharmacy Canada was through the call
    centre in Mississauga, which the website repeatedly encouraged customers to
    contact by phone, mail or FAX.  A Safety Tips page encouraged consumers to
    “know where your company is really located, not where they say they are” and
    stated that Global Pharmacy Canada is “in fact located in Canada”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    February 2011, the website no longer described Global Pharmacy Canada as a
    Canadian pharmacy company.  However, it continued to refer to itself as Global
    Pharmacy Canada and to its “dedicated staff of friendly customer service agents
    located in Toronto, Canada”. It continued to direct all customer interactions,
    including orders, payments and complaints, to the call centre at the same
    address and phone number in Mississauga.  The order form continued to feature
    the red maple leaf and Canadian flag.  </p>
  <p class=Heading><i>The Sale Process After
    Restructuring</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    para. 136 of her reasons, the application judge provides a clear roadmap for
    how the appellants sold prescription drugs following the restructuring.  That
    roadmap is invaluable in resolving the issues on appeal.  Thus, I reproduce para.
    136 of the reasons in full.    </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[136] The following are the undisputed facts with respect to
    how the sale of drugs on behalf of GPC-Belize now occurs:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Individuals
    initiate the purchase of drugs by completing a Patient Order Form, available by
    mail or online from the www.globalpharmacycanada.com website. GPC-Belize owns
    the website.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once completed,
    the Patient Order Form is sent by mail, fax, or electronically, with copies of
    prescriptions, pill bottles, or pharmacy receipts to “Global Pharmacy Canada
    Inc. c/o RX Processing Services, Inc.” to the Mississauga address, or to the
    Mississauga email address.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The payment
    method on the Patient Order Form is by Visa or MasterCard.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Patient
    Order Form confirms “we will not process your credit card until <u>we have
    completed your order</u>” (emphasis added). The purchaser must sign authorizing
    the credit card payment and include the security code, the expiry date, and
    number of the card to facilitate payment.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The staff at RXP
    complete the necessary documentation to process the payment of the client from
    their Visa or MasterCard to complete the order. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Payment by
    cheque and money order is also accepted. Richard Petko’s evidence was that
    payment in this manner was a small percentage of the total drug sales. Between
    August 1, 2012 and February 4, 2013, over $1,200,000 USD was deposited into
    this account. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Up until
    February 4, 2013, GPC-Ontario deposited cheques payable to Global Pharmacy
    Canada Inc. to GPC-Ontario’s CIBC USD bank account, used exclusively for this
    purpose. Periodically, proceeds from this account were wired by the RXP staff
    to GPC-Belize, less the 3% agreed upon fee for service. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Payment
    Processing Services Agreement was terminated by David Billings on January 5,
    2013, although no changes occurred in the procedures as reflected in the
    February 6, 2013 bank statement. The sum of $119,672.71 was deposited into the
    CIBC account between February 1 and February 5, 2013.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>9.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Patient
    Order Form confirms that Global Pharmacy Canada Inc. is appointed to act <u>as
    agent for the patient</u> for the purpose of conveying the order to a licenced
    pharmacy in India (emphasis added). The patient signs this acknowledgment. The
    acknowledgement confirms that the patient agrees to be bound by the terms and
    conditions available at the Global Pharmacy Canada website. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>10. The
    patient order form contains a reorder form and a reminder. By ticking off the
    reorder box, the patient authorizes the credit card on file to be used to
    automatically reorder the drug and process future payments every three months,
    without the need for any further proof of a valid ongoing prescription.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>11. RXP Staff
    in Mississauga process the order by completing the documentation necessary to
    process the Visa or MasterCard payment. The customer is charged the full amount
    for the prescription drugs requested.  Visa or MasterCard in turn processes the
    credit card payment for the correct amount and forwards these amounts to the
    account of GPC-Belize.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>12. Once
    confirmation of payment is received by Visa or MasterCard, or by the cheque
    clearing the bank, the staff of RXP then inputs the customer’s order form and
    prescriptions into the Global Pharmacy Canada website to be filled by a
    supplier in India. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>13. According
    to D’Adderio, manager at RXP, at the end of each day, all orders processed by
    the RXP staff are uploaded to a website that is accessed by the participating
    pharmacists in India. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>14. I note
    that there is no named pharmacist in India. There is no indication in any of
    the documentation sent to the client who the supplier of the drugs may be, and
    whether or not these drugs in fact come from an Indian pharmacist as
    represented, or from a supplier of drugs. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>15. Orders are
    confirmed by an email sent by “orders@globalpharmacycanada.com” or by letter
    sent by “Your Friends at Global Pharmacy Canada”, enclosing a Global Pharmacy
    Canada fridge magnet. The header of this confirmation letter reads “Global
    Pharmacy Canada c/o RX Processing Services, Inc.” with the Mississauga address
    and phone number, and the www.globalpharmacycanada.com website. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>16. An invoice
    is prepared by the supplier in India or by the Global Pharmacy Canada website
    accessed by the supplier (this was not clear on the evidence) and is placed in
    the package which is shipped from India to the client in the United States or
    elsewhere. The header of the invoice states “Global Pharmacy Canada” and lists
    the Dundas Street Mississauga Address, without mention of RXP. The footer of
    the invoice describes how consumers can re-order drugs, stating: “Please fax
    this form to: (866)850-6021 or send by mail to: 1090 Dundas St. East, Suite
    106, Mississauga ON L4Y 2B8, CANADA (the RXP address). For faster service, call
    us at (866)850-6021 to authorize your refill over the phone.”</p>
  <p class=CQuote>17. The packages
    are sent to the United States without any indication that they contain
    prescription drugs. The customs declaration form that appears on the outside of
    each package states “health products for personal use”.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>18. There is
    no evidence before me how the Indian supplier of the drugs is paid. I presume
    that GPC-Belize pays the supplier of the drugs the agreed upon fee. RXP plays
    no role in the payment of the Indian supplier of the drugs.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>19. If for
    some reason one of the Indian suppliers cannot fill the order, RXP remains
    involved in the process. If the drug is not available, RXP will advise the
    customer and will do one of two things. One option is to reverse any credit
    card charges that have been made when the drugs were ordered if the drug is no
    longer available. If the drug is on back-order and not presently available, the
    RXP staff will advise the customer of the delay, and the customer will decide
    whether to wait to obtain the drug, or whether he or she wished to obtain a
    refund. The RXP staff will produce the paperwork for the refund at the
    customers’ direction.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>20. RXP staff receive
    and resolve customer complaints involving all practical matters including
    non-delivery or delayed delivery of the drugs. If the customer raises any
    problem with the effects of the medication itself, the RXP representative tells
    the person to see his or her doctor. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>21. Prior to
    the involvement of Health Canada, any allegedly defective goods were returned
    by the purchaser to the Mississauga address. As a result of Health Canada’s
    concerns about the presence of drugs at the call centre premises, now, if there
    is a problem with an order, the purchasers are advised by the staff at the call
    center to either destroy the product, or return the drugs to the supplier in
    India. As noted, there is no information in the package received by a client
    who is the supplier of the drug.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE DECISION BELOW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that the appellants were selling prescription drugs,
    by retail, in Ontario.  She further concluded that the College had jurisdiction
    to regulate the appellants’ activities.  A summary of her reasoning on both
    matters follows.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>The Appellants are
    Selling Prescription Drugs in Ontario</i></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge began her analysis on where a “sale” occurs by referring to
    the traditional definitions such as the transfer, by mutual assent, of the
    ownership of a thing from one person to another for a money price.  She noted the
    difficulty of applying traditional legal concepts of sales to contracts made
    via the internet.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge then discussed <em>Prescriptions4us v. Ordre des pharmaciens
    du Quebec</em>, [2004] Q.J. No. 9014 (S.C.), aff’d [2004] J.Q. No. 13143 (C.A.). 
    In <em>Prescriptions4us</em>, Cohen J. considered whether the sale by a
    Quebec-based company to Americans, of prescription drugs sourced from Manitoba
    pharmacists, could be said to have taken place in Quebec.  In concluding that
    it had, Cohen J. applied ordinary contractual concepts of offer and acceptance under
    the relevant provision of the <i>Civil Code of Quebec</i>, S.Q. 1991, c. 64.   Prescriptions4us’s
    head office was located in Montreal.  To purchase drugs, the consumer obtained
    the necessary forms from Prescriptions4us’s website, completed them, and sent
    them to the head office.  Justice Cohen concluded that there could be no other
    possible location for the conclusion of the contract than Montreal – the place
    of the offer and the place where the acceptance was received by the vendor.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the application judge then set out a detailed roadmap of how customers
    purchase prescription drugs from the appellants (reproduced at para. 42, above). 
    She rejected the appellants’ submission that acceptance should be characterized
    as the Indian supplier’s confirmation that it would forward the drugs to the
    purchaser or as the forwarding of payments by the credit card companies to
    GPC-Belize.  In her view, based on the roadmap and traditional contract law
    principles, the appellants could be understood to be selling drugs in Ontario. 
    She reached the same conclusion using the approach set out by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in C<em>elgene Corp. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2011 SCC 1,
    [2011] 1 S.C.R. 3.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Celgene</em>, pharmaceutical drugs were being sold by a New Jersey-based
    distributor to consumers in Canada.  The distributor argued that the New Jersey
    head office was the locus of sale according to commercial law principles, and
    therefore that it was not obliged to provide pricing information to the
    Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (the “Board”). The Board acknowledged
    that the sale took place in New Jersey, according to commercial law
    principles.  However, it took the position that the consumer protection purpose
    of the <em>Patent Act, </em>R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, and the Board’s mandate to
    protect Canadians from excessive prices charged for patented medicines,
    militated against a strict commercial law interpretation of the legislative
    phrase “sold in any market in Canada”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court upheld the Board’s reasoning and result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the application judge’s view, as expressed at para. 153 of her reasons, <i>Celgene </i>confirms “that a purposive analysis of the meaning of sale is appropriate,
    and that substance, not form, should be relevant in assessing whether there is
    a sale, unless the words are not capable of bearing any other meaning”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts as she found them, the application judge said that the “only rational
    conclusion” was that the sale of drugs by the appellants was taking place in
    Ontario. </p>
  <p class=Heading><i>The College has Jurisdiction Based
    on a Sufficient Connection</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that the College has jurisdiction to regulate the
    appellants’ conduct because of “a wealth of evidence” showing a sufficient
    connection between the appellants’ activities and Ontario.      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge set out the applicable legal principles for establishing
    whether a sufficient connection exists, relying on, among other cases, <i>Unifund
    Assurance Co. v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia</i>, 2003 SCC 40, [2003] 2
    S.C.R. 63, and <i>Crowe v. Ontario Securities Commission</i>, 2011 ONSC 6918,
    108 O.R. (3d) 410 (Div. Ct.).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    then made detailed findings of fact about the structure and operation of RXP
    and GPC-Belize, and the relationships among the principals of those entities. 
    She found that, despite the various agreements that had been entered into as
    part of the restructuring, from a practical perspective, “little [had] changed”
    as a result of the restructuring.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge further found that RXP was an agent with apparent authority,
    if not actual authority, to contract on behalf of GPC-Belize.  While some of the
    terms of the various contracts might suggest otherwise, her factual findings
    led her to conclude that RXP was acting as agent for GPC-Belize in the retail
    sale of prescription drugs.  The documents, “considered as a whole”, gave RXP
    actual authority to bind GPC-Belize.  Further, GPC-Belize made representations
    on its website to the effect that RXP had the authority to bind it, in
    contract, to individuals purchasing its retail prescription drugs.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the application judge rejected the argument that the College was without
    jurisdiction because the purchasers were not residents of Ontario or Canada. 
    Relying on <i>Gregory &amp; Co. Inc. v. Quebec Securities Commission</i>,
    [1961] S.C.R. 584, and <i>Thorpe v. College of Pharmacists of British Columbia </i>(1992),
    97 D.L.R. (4th) 634 (B.C.C.A.), the application judge stated that the
    sufficient connection test can be met even if the public affected by the
    activity in question is outside the jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=Heading>THE ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    appeals raise two issues.  Did the application judge err in her determination
    that the appellants are:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>1.  selling prescription
    drugs, by retail, in Ontario; and </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>2.  subject
    to the College’s jurisdiction?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that the application judge erred in concluding that they sell,
    by retail, prescription drugs in Ontario.  Their submission runs as follows.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GPC-Belize
    is in the business of facilitating the purchase, by Americans, of
    pharmaceutical drugs from India.  All significant aspects of its business
    involve activities outside Ontario.  Its sole connection with Ontario is its
    contractual arrangement with RXP, under which RXP provides ancillary support
    and administrative services.  GPC-Belize has no physical presence in Ontario,
    has no Ontario personnel, does no advertising or solicitation of Ontario
    residents, does not import pharmaceutical drugs into Ontario, and sells no
    drugs to Ontario residents.  In short, the appellants say they are not selling
    pharmaceutical drugs in Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this submission.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Celgene </i>instructs us that in a regulatory
    context, words such as “place of sale”, “sold” and “selling” may not
    necessarily be given their strict commercial law meanings.  At para. 21 of <i>Celgene</i>,
    the Court says that “[t]he words, if clear, will dominate; if not, they yield
    to an interpretation that best meets the overriding purpose of the statute.”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the application judge that, given the overriding purpose of the
    relevant legislation in this case, a purposive approach to determining the
    meaning of sale is appropriate.  The College has a mandate to regulate the sale
    of prescription drugs in the province, and a duty to serve and protect the
    public interest – it is the substance, and not the form, which is relevant when
    determining whether the sale of prescription drugs takes place in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge made detailed findings of fact about the sale process
    following restructuring.  On those findings, it is clear that the substance of
    the sale transaction takes place through RXP, an Ontario corporation that is
    located and operates in Ontario.  As the application judge noted, “[a]ll
    documentation – including the Patient Order Form, confirmation of the order,
    the invoice, and the packing slip – are in the name of Global Pharmacy Canada
    bearing the Mississauga address.”  Furthermore, critical aspects of the sale
    transaction by which the customers get prescription drugs and the appellants
    get paid for providing them, are conducted by RXP.  The customer submits its
    order form, which RXP processes, or calls RXP with its order.  RXP takes the
    order and processes payment for it.  RXP then arranges for the delivery of the
    drugs directly to the American customer.  If there is a problem, customers
    contact RXP.  In short, without RXP staff at the call centre in Mississauga, no
    prescription drugs would flow from Global Pharmacy Canada (or GPC-Belize) to
    its customers and GPC-Belize would not get paid.                 </p>
  <p class=Heading>ARE THE APPELLANTS SUBJECT TO THE COLLEGE’S JURISDICTION?<i> </i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that there are such “few and relatively insignificant points of
    contact” between GPC-Belize and Ontario that the application judge erred in
    finding a sufficient connection to ground the College’s jurisdiction. 
    Specifically, they submit that she erred in two ways.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they contend that the application judge erroneously blurred the distinctions
    between the activities of GPC-Belize and RXP – the two are separate companies
    whose relationship is governed by contract and the separate legal personality
    of each must be respected.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    they submit that the application judge erred in treating RXP as GPC-Belize’s
    agent in matters relating to GPC-Belize’s business, including contract
    formation.  They contend that GPC-Belize lacks a meaningful connection to
    Ontario and that the central aspects of its business (its customers, products,
    and suppliers) do not touch Ontario.  The “administrative service” that RXP
    provides is an insufficient point of contact to give the College jurisdiction over
    them.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellants’ submission on this issue is essentially an attack on
    the application judge’s findings of fact.  Those findings are not to be
    overturned, absent palpable and overriding error.  There is none. 
    Consequently, I see nothing in this submission.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute about the legal principles that apply when determining the
    applicability of a provincial regulatory scheme to the out-of-province
    appellants.  The question is whether there is a sufficient connection between
    those appellants and Ontario, such that the College has jurisdiction over them. 
    The first two propositions in para. 56 of <i>Unifund</i> provide the starting
    point for answering that question:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>Consideration
    of constitutional <i>applicability </i>can conveniently be organized around the
    following propositions:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>1. The territorial limits on the scope of provincial legislative
    authority prevent the application of the law of a province to matters not
    sufficiently connected to it;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>2.  What constitutes a “sufficient” connection depends on the
    relationship among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the
    legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated by it; …   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    as the application judge observed, there is no single standard defining what
    constitutes a sufficient connection: whether there is a sufficient connection
    depends largely on context.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    are some of the application judge’s factual findings, which underlie her
    conclusion that there was a sufficient connection between the appellants and
    Ontario to ground the College’s jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From May 2009 to January 2010, RXP was not paid for the services
    it rendered to GPC-Belize.  Instead, it simply kept any funds flowing from
    cheques it received that were made payable to Global Pharmacy Canada Inc.;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>RXP does not present any sort of budget to GPC-Belize –
    GPC-Belize simply pays all amounts requested, with no questions asked;    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “players” in Ontario at RXP are the same individuals who
    owned and operated GPC-Ontario;   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The manager of RXP confirmed that nothing about his task had
    changed since the restructuring;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The RXP staff perform essentially the same functions as they did
    on behalf of GPC-Ontario before the restructuring, from the same premises. 
    They continue to answer the phone “Global Pharmacy Canada”, as they did before
    the restructuring.  They continue to receive and process orders and payments
    for the drugs, and respond to customer complaints.  All customer mail and
    enquiries continue to be directed to the call centre;     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The RXP staff perform the activities that the website claims are
    performed by Global Pharmacy Canada; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The organizational distinctions between RXP and GPC-Belize are
    blurred.  For example, one provision in the Agreement confirms that RXP
    functions under the “control and policy direction” of GPC-Belize;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The January 2010 Payment Processing Services Agreement, signed by
    Billings on behalf of GPC-Belize and Petko on behalf of GPC-Ontario, provides
    evidence that the two companies are not “in substance … as separate as
    claimed”.  In this regard it will be recalled that for many months following
    the sale of its intangible assets from GPC-Ontario to GPC-Belize, GPC-Ontario
    continued to deposit cheques made out to Global Pharmacy Canada into its own
    bank account.      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge did not blur the legally distinct personas of GPC-Belize and
    RXP, as the appellants contend.  Rather, as the foregoing list demonstrates,
    she made factual findings which show that although the two have separate legal
    identities, they do not operate separately.  Apart from contact with the
    GPC-Belize website, all contact between Global Pharmacy Canada and its
    customers is exclusively through the RXP call centre here in Ontario.  In light
    of the application judge’s findings, her determination that the two companies do
    not operate independently is amply justified.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the application judge’s factual findings justify her determination that RXP
    serves as GPC-Belize’s agent in matters relating to GPC-Belize’s business,
    including contract formation.  Given those findings, it is clear that RXP provides
    much more than merely “administrative service” to GPC-Belize.  The RXP call
    centre in Mississauga is home to the only staff that deal with Global Pharmacy
    Canada customers.  They are, for all intents and purposes, its sales force.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also reject the submission that there is no or insufficient connection between each
    of Billings and Onuffer and Ontario to ground jurisdiction.  Those appellants
    were given the full opportunity to participate in these proceedings.  They
    chose to file no evidence.  On the findings of the application judge, both are
    connected to the Global Pharmacy Canada business, core aspects of which are
    performed by RXP here in Ontario.  Recall in this regard that Billings, in his
    role as GPC-Belize’s CFO, signed the restructuring documents on behalf of
    GPC-Belize.  Recall also his close personal and longstanding relationship with
    Petko.  Recall further Global Pharmacy Canada’s press releases in which Onuffer
    is described as being with Global Pharmacy Canada and then quoted at length. </p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBold>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I reject the appellants’ submission that the College is “overreaching” by
    assuming jurisdiction over them.  The College’s duty under s. 3(2) of the Code<i> </i>is “to serve and protect the public interest”.  In the circumstances of this
    case, the territorial limits on the scope of the provincial legislative
    authority relate to the <strong><i><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>conduct</span></i></strong> that the College can regulate.  The College’s reach is not defined as, or
    limited to, the Ontario public.  </p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBold><b>CONCLUSION </b></p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBold>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have explained, in this case there is conduct over which the College has
    power to regulate:  the sale of prescription drugs in Ontario.  The principle
    that regulators may act to protect persons who are located outside the
    regulator’s territorial jurisdiction, when the conduct targeted by the
    regulator occurs within the jurisdiction, has been repeatedly affirmed, beginning
    with <i>Gregory</i>, at p. 588.  See also <i>Thorpe</i>, at p. 640, and <i>Crowe</i>,
    at para. 32.  </p>
  <p class=StyleAParaNumberingBold>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    College is not overreaching – it is fulfilling its legislated duty to serve and
    protect the public interest in the matters over which it has been given authority,
    including the sale of prescription drugs in Ontario.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the domain of pharmaceutical drugs, reputation is based on regulation.  If a
    company trades on Ontario’s reputation for quality and strong regulatory
    standards, and sites a critical part of the sales process in Ontario, it will
    be subject to Ontario’s regulation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss both appeals with costs, payable on a joint and several
    liability basis, to the College fixed at $25,000, all inclusive.    </p>
