  <p class=Judge>Cronk J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>I.        Introduction<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></b></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Yonatan Mekonnen, is HIVpositive.  Following two
    separate trials in 2009, he was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual
    assault in relation to two different women for not disclosing his HIVpositive status
    prior to sexual activity.  He appealed both convictions.  He has fully served
    the sentences imposed at his trials.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellants conviction appeals were pending, the Supreme Court
    of Canada released its decision in <em>R. v. Mabior</em>, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2
    S.C.R. 584, together with its companion decision in <em>R. v. D.C.</em>, 2012
    SCC 48, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 626.  In <em>Mabior</em>, the Supreme Court revisited
    its approach in <em>R. v. Cuerrier</em>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371 to the
    determination whether fraud vitiates consent to sexual relations and whether
    the non-disclosure of HIVpositive  status prior to sexual relations can constitute
    fraud vitiating consent within the meaning of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties accept that <em>Mabior </em>has overtaken the original
    grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant and the Crowns responding
    positions on the appellants conviction appeals.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant in his factum originally sought acquittals
    concerning his convictions, during oral argument he submitted that, based on <em>Mabior</em>,
    his appeals should be allowed and stay orders should be granted in respect of
    all proceedings on the charged offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown initially argued in its post-<em>Mabior</em> factum that the
    appellants appeals should be allowed and new trials ordered in each case.  However,
    during oral argument, the Crown also altered its position.  The Crown now
    supports the appellants request that the appeals be allowed and stay orders
    granted in relation to each proceeding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the significantly narrowed scope of the appeals, the task for this
    court is to apply the <em>Mabior</em> decision to the facts of these cases and,
    if the appeals are allowed, to fashion proper remedies in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I agree that the appeals should be
    allowed.  I am also of the view that the Crowns position at the appeal hearing
    regarding suitable remedies was professional and appropriate.  I would accept
    the joint position of the parties, allow the appeals, set aside the convictions
    and grant a stay of each proceeding.  I would also alter the ancillary orders
    imposed at the appellants trials in the manner described below.</p>
  <p class=Heading>II.       Background Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant background facts are essentially undisputed and may be set
    out in brief compass.</p>
  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The First Trial  Complainant L.L. (C51376)</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 26, 2008, the appellant was charged with one count of aggravated
    sexual assault involving the complainant, L.L.  It was alleged that between
    November 2007 and January 2008, the appellant had vaginal intercourse with L.L.
    on three separate occasions without disclosing his HIVpositive status. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was tried before Bovard J. of the Ontario Court of Justice in September
    of 2009.  At trial, the complainant testified that during each of the three
    sexual encounters, the appellant wore a condom prior to intercourse.  On one
    occasion, the complainant performed fellatio on the appellant.  The complainant
    said that the appellant may have worn a condom when she fellated him, but she
    could not recall.  She testified that he probably did not ejaculate in her
    mouth.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on an agreed statement of facts filed at trial, it was established that the
    appellant knew he was HIVpositive before he met the complainant.  The
    complainant said that the appellant did not disclose his HIVpositive status to
    her.  She claimed that she would not have engaged in sexual activity with the
    appellant if she had known he was HIVpositive.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant discovered that the appellant had HIV when a friend told her that
    she had seen his picture in the newspaper.  The complainant then saw her doctor
    and was tested for HIV.  She testified that she was in agony during the
    ensuing month as she awaited her test results.  She said that she was scared,
    devastated, cried daily, and thought that she was going to die.  Fortunately, the
    complainants test results eventually revealed that she had not contracted HIV.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified in his own defence.  He denied having any sexual contact
    with the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    medical or expert evidence was called by the Crown to quantify the risk
    associated with the three acts of protected sexual intercourse described by the
    complainant. Although the agreed statement of facts contained an acknowledgment
    that HIV can be transmitted through the exchange of any bodily fluid, there
    was no evidence that bodily fluids, in fact, were exchanged on any of the three
    occasions of sexual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel at trial (not counsel on appeal) conceded that if the trial judge found
    that the appellant and the complainant had engaged in either sexual intercourse
    or oral sex and that the appellant had not disclosed his HIVpositive status to
    the complainant, a conviction for aggravated sexual assault should follow.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellants claim that he had not engaged in sexual
    activity with the complainant.  He accepted the complainants account of
    protected sexual activity without disclosure by the appellant that he was
    HIVpositive.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    and in light of defence counsels concession, the appellant was convicted on
    September 14, 2009, of aggravated sexual assault.  On December 15, 2009, he was
    sentenced to 12 months incarceration, plus three years probation.  A ten-year
    weapons prohibition order, a lifetime order under the <em>Sex Offender
    Information Registration Act</em>, S.C. 2004, c. 10 (SOIRA), and a DNA data
    bank order were also imposed. </p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Second Trial  Complainant K.S. (C51878)</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a separate information dated June 20, 2008, as amended on July 14, 2009, the appellant
    was charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault involving the
    complainant, K.S.  In respect of these charges, it was alleged that the
    appellant had sexual relations with the complainant during the months of
    January and February 2008, without disclosing his HIVpositive status.  Justice
    James J. Keaney of the Ontario Court of Justice presided over this trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, it was established that the complainant met the appellant in December
    2007, one month after he learned that he had HIV.  The complainant testified
    that she began to date the appellant and first had sex with him in January of 2008. 
    She said that during their first sexual encounter, the appellant performed oral
    sex on her and they then had vaginal intercourse, without the protection of a
    condom.  The complainant claimed that immediately afterwards, she and the
    appellant discussed the possibility of contracting sexually transmitted
    diseases.  She said that the appellant lied to her, claiming that he was free
    of infection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainants relationship with the appellant continued over the next few
    months, during which they had sexual intercourse, on a protected and
    unprotected basis, on numerous occasions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    about February 2008, the appellant began living with the complainant and her
    mother.  Towards the end of February or early March, the complainant and the
    appellant decided to rent their own apartment together.  The complainant
    maintained that on the day before they were scheduled to move, the appellant
    told her that he had just learned that he was HIVpositive.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was shocked and upset.  The next day, she broke down at work and her
    boss arranged for her to attend a public health clinic where she was tested for
    HIV.  Fortunately, she later learned that she had not contracted the disease.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
    these events, the complainant and the appellant moved into their own apartment together
    and continued to have sex, using a condom.  The complainant said that, on occasion,
    the use of a condom was delayed.  Their relationship ended in April or May 2008.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also called Dr. David Richardson, the appellants HIV doctor.  He testified
    that the use of condoms substantially reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk
    of HIV transmission.  However, he provided no evidence concerning the specific
    level of risk associated with unprotected sex or the reduction in that risk to
    be gained with condom use.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Richardsons clinical notes were filed as an exhibit at trial.  In one of his
    notes, dated April 2, 2008, Dr. Richardson recorded that he had explained to
    the appellant that his viral load is low.  It appears that the issue of the
    appellants viral load was not addressed at the trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he was in denial about being HIVpositive when he
    first met the complainant.  He said that he and the complainant had intercourse
    once  on Valentines Day in February 2008  before moving into their own place
    together.  He claimed that they used a condom on that occasion but acknowledged
    that he did not disclose his HIVpositive status to the complainant.  According
    to the appellant, the couple used a condom on each subsequent occasion when
    they had sex together.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held, on the authority of <em>Cuerrier</em>, that because the
    appellant admitted to having had sex with the complainant without first
    disclosing his HIVpositive status, the appellants own evidence established fraud
    vitiating the complainants consent to sex regardless of whether a condom had
    been used.  He found that condom use, in any event, is not absolutely safe and
    that the appellant had endangered the complainants life when he knowingly
    failed to disclose his HIVpositive to her on their first sexual encounter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge was unable to conclude that the complainant and the appellant
    had sex in January of 2008.  Accordingly, he convicted the appellant on the
    count of aggravated sexual assault pertaining to the events of February 2008
    and acquitted him of the like count relating to the alleged events of January
    2008.  The appellant was subsequently sentenced to nine months incarceration,
    plus three years probation.  He was also ordered to provide a sample of his
    DNA and to register, for life, under the SOIRA.  A lifetime weapons prohibition
    order was also made under s. 109 of the Code. </p>
  <p class=Heading>III.      The <em>Cuerrier</em> Decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Cuerrier</em>, the Supreme Court held that the failure to inform a sexual
    partner of ones HIV status may constitute fraud vitiating consent.  The
    Supreme Court emphasized that the essential elements of fraud are dishonesty
    and deprivation or risk of deprivation.  Justice Cory, writing for the
    majority, described the proof of dishonesty requirement of fraud in part in
    this fashion, at paras. 125127:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Persons knowing that they are HIVpositive who engage in sexual
    intercourse without advising their partner of the disease may be found to
    fulfil the traditional requirements for fraud namely dishonesty and depri-vation. 
    That fraud may vitiate a partners consent to engage in sexual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he dishonest action or behaviour must be related to the
    obtaining of consent to engage in sexual intercourse, in this case unprotected
    intercourse.  The actions of the accused must be assessed objectively to
    determine whether a reasonable person would find them to be dishonest.  The
    dishonest act consists of either deliberate deceit respecting HIV status or non-disclosure
    of that status. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Without disclosure of HIV status there cannot be a true
    consent.  The consent cannot simply be to have sexual intercourse.  Rather it
    must be consent to have intercourse with a partner who is HIVpositive.  True
    consent cannot be given if there has not been a disclosure by the accused of
    his HIVpositive status.  A consent that is not based upon knowledge of the
    significant relevant factors is not a valid consent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Cory then turned to the second requirement of fraud  that the dishonesty result
    in deprivation or risk of deprivation.  He said, at para. 128:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[The deprivation or risk of deprivation] may consist of actual
    harm or simply a risk of harm.  Yet it cannot be any trivial harm or risk of
    harm that will satisfy this requirement in sexual assault cases where the
    activity would have been consensual if the consent had not been obtained by
    fraud.  For example, the risk of minor scratches or of catching cold would not
    suffice to establish deprivation.  What then should be required?  <em>In my
    view, the Crown will have to establish that the dishonest act (either
    falsehoods or failure to disclose) had the effect of exposing the person
    consenting to a significant risk of serious bodily harm.  The risk of
    contracting AIDS as a result of engaging in unprotected intercourse would
    clearly meet that test.</em>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Cory then added this important observation, at para. 129:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To have intercourse with a person who is HIVpositive will
    always present risks.  Absolutely safe sex may be impossible.  Yet the careful use
    of condoms might be found to so reduce the risk of harm that it could no longer
    be considered significant so that there might not be either deprivation or risk
    of deprivation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application of the <em>Cuerrier</em> test sometimes proved difficult and
    controversial.  The Crown fairly put it this way in its supplementary factum,
    at para. 26:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The test was viewed by many as vague, resulting in considerable
    uncertainty concerning the scope of disclosure obligations and the protection
    of the public.  Further, establishing a threshold for determining what a
    significant risk actually was had become a numbers game  and given the
    variable factors that impact on transmission rates, that assessment often proved
    difficult.  Triers of fact applied different thresholds to determine the
    significance of the risk, with inconsistent results across the country and
    within provinces.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    HIV poses a risk of serious bodily harm, the operative offence under the Code
    is aggravated sexual assault.  Although <em>Cuerrier</em> established the requirements
    for this offence, the precise circumstances in which the failure to disclose
    HIV status would vitiate consent, thereby giving rise to criminal liability,
    remained unclear.  In <em>Mabior</em>, the Supreme Court was asked to clarify
    those circumstances and the <em>Cuerrier</em> test of significant risk of
    serious bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=Heading>IV.     The <em>Mabior </em>and<em> D.C.</em> Decisions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Mabior</em>, the accused was charged with nine counts of aggravated sexual
    assault for failing to disclose his HIVpositive status to nine complainants
    before they had sex with him.  None of the complainants contracted HIV.  At
    trial, the accused was convicted on six of the counts.  He was acquitted on the
    other three counts on the basis that protected intercourse  the use of a
    condom  when the HIVpositive persons viral loads are undetectable does not
    place a sexual partner at significant risk of serious bodily harm within the
    meaning of <em>Cuerrier</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Manitoba Court of Appeal varied the trial decision, holding that <em>either </em>a
    low viral load or condom use could negate significant risk of serious bodily
    harm.  The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions on two counts where neither
    was established and entered acquittals on the remaining four counts, based on
    proof of either condom use or a low viral load.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a Crown appeal from the acquittals, the Supreme Court restored the convictions
    for the incidents in which the accused did not have a low viral load and use of
    a condom was not established.  The court confirmed the continuing validity of
    the <em>Cuerrier</em> test of a significant risk of serious bodily harm,
    commenting, at para. 58, that the tests approach to consent accepts the
    wisdom of the common law that not every deception that leads to sexual
    intercourse should be criminalized, while still according consent meaningful
    scope.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Mabior</em> court also sought to clarify the meaning of the significant
    risk of serious bodily harm test by indicating when the test is met in terms
    of principle and concrete situations: <em>Mabior</em>, at para. 81.  Chief Justice
    McLachlin, writing for a unanimous court, held at para. 84:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, a significant risk of serious bodily harm
    connotes a position between the extremes of no risk (the trial judges test)
    and high risk (the Court of Appeals test).  <em>Where there is a</em> <span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>realistic possibility of transmission of HIV</span><em>,
    a significant risk of serious bodily harm is established, and the deprivation
    element of the Cuerrier test is met. </em> [Underlined emphasis in original; italicized
    emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing various considerations that supported this approach, McLachlin C.J.
    indicated, at para. 91:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>These considerations lead me to conclude that <em>the Cuerrier
    requirement</em> of significant risk of serious bodily harm <em>should be
    read as requiring disclosure of HIV status if there is a realistic possibility
    of transmission of HIV</em>.  If there is no realistic possibility of
    transmission of HIV, failure to disclose that one has HIV will not constitute
    fraud vitiating consent to sexual relations under s. 265(3)(<em>c</em>) [of the
    Code].  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    McLachlin C.J. noted, at para. 92,  significant risk depends both on the
    degree of harm and risk of transmission.  These two factors vary inversely. 
    With respect to when there is a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV,
    McLachlin C.J. made this central finding, at para. 94:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The evidence adduced here satisfies me that, as a general
    matter, a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV is negated if (i) the
    accuseds viral load at the time of sexual relations was low, <em>and</em> (ii)
    condom protection was used.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chief
    Justice McLachlin went on to add, at paras. 101 and 104:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[O]n the evidence before us, the ultimate percentage risk of
    transmission resulting from the combined effect of condom use <em>and</em> low
    viral load is clearly extremely low  so low that the risk is reduced to a
    speculative possibility rather than a realistic possibility.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he general proposition that a low viral load combined with
    condom use negates a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV does not
    preclude the common law from adapting to future advances in treatment and to
    circumstances where risk factors other than those considered in the present
    case are at play.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court summarized its findings in <em>Mabior</em>, at paras. 104-105, in
    these terms:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To summarize, to obtain a conviction under ss. 265(3)(<em>c</em>)
    and 273, the Crown must show that the complainants consent to sexual
    intercourse was vitiated by the accuseds fraud as to his HIV status.  Failure
    to disclose (<em>the dishonest act</em>) amounts to fraud where the complainant
    would not have consented had he or she known the accused was HIVpositive, and
    where sexual contact poses a significant risk of or causes actual serious
    bodily harm (<em>deprivation</em>).  A significant risk of serious bodily harm
    is established by a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV.  On the
    evidence before us, a realistic possibility of transmission is negated by
    evidence that the accuseds viral load was low at the time of intercourse and
    that condom protection was used. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The usual rules of evidence and proof apply.  The Crown bears
    the burden of establishing the elements of the offence  a dishonest act and
    deprivation  beyond a reasonable doubt.  Where the Crown has made a <em>prima
    facie</em> case of deception and deprivation as described in these reasons, a
    tactical burden may fall on the accused to raise a reasonable doubt, by calling
    evidence that he had a low viral load at the time and that condom protection
    was used. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    holdings in <em>Mabior</em> were directly applied in the companion case of <em>D.C.</em> 
    In that case, the accused was charged with sexual assault and aggravated
    assault.  It was alleged that when the accused first engaged in vaginal
    intercourse with her male partner, she did not disclose her HIVpositive status. 
    At the time, the accuseds viral load was undetectable.  The critical issue,
    therefore, was whether the couple had used a condom.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the accuseds and her partners evidence at trial, there was conflicting
    evidence regarding whether a condom had been used.  The trial judge, relying on
    a dated note in the accuseds medical records, inferred that no condom had been
    worn and convicted the accused of both charges.  Contrary to the standard
    subsequently set out in <em>Mabior</em>, the Quebec Court of Appeal set aside
    the convictions on the ground that even without condom use, the significant
    risk test established in <em>Cuerrier</em> had not been met, given the accuseds
    undetectable viral load.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court applied the <em>Mabior</em> significant risk standard, holding
    that condom use, in addition to a low viral load, was necessary in order for
    the accused to avoid criminal liability for failing to disclose her HIVpositive
    status.  In other words, in accordance with <em>Mabior</em>,<em> D.C.</em> also
    holds that condom use is required to preclude a realistic possibility of HIV
    transmission.  In the result, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal but set
    aside the convictions based on the trial judges impermissible inference from
    the accuseds medical records that a condom had not been used.</p>
  <p class=Heading>V.      Application of <em>Mabior</em> and <em>D.C.</em> to
    the Facts of these Cases</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that in light of <em>Mabior</em> and <em>D.C.</em>, these
    appeals must be allowed.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    and importantly, the Crown concedes that the appeals should be allowed.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    based on the <em>Mabior</em> courts clarification of the significant risk of serious
    bodily harm test enunciated in <em>Cuerrier</em>, the findings at both of the
    appellants trials are insufficient to support the convictions entered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction at the appellants first trial (involving L.L.) was grounded, at
    least in part, on defence counsels concession at that trial that the appellant
    should be convicted of aggravated sexual assault if sexual intercourse or oral
    sex was found to have occurred without disclosure by the appellant of his HIVpositive
    status.  I agree with Crown counsels submission before this court that a conviction
    on this basis alone does not meet the <em>Mabior</em> standard of a realistic
    possibility of HIV transmission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction entered at the appellants second trial (involving K.S.) is also
    unsustainable.  There was no evidence at this trial as to the risk associated
    with the sexual activity engaged in by the appellant.  Critically, the trial
    judge made no finding to resolve the conflicting evidence on whether a condom
    was actually used.  On the state of the law at the time, the trial judge
    regarded it as immaterial to resolve this issue.  However, under the <em>Mabior</em> standard, proof of condom use, while not always essential, may be highly
    material to the demonstration of a realistic possibility of transmission of
    HIV.  Without such a realistic possibility, a significant risk of serious
    bodily harm cannot be made out.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would accept the parties joint position that the appeals must be allowed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    leaves only the question of remedy.  Although originally contested, the parties
    now agree that stay orders should be granted in respect of both proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Generally,
    a stay of criminal proceedings is granted only in exceptional circumstances. 
    The high threshold for a stay recognizes that stayed charges may never be
    prosecuted or resolved by a trier of fact.  See for example, <em>R. v. Regan</em>,
    2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 53.   In the cases at bar, in my
    opinion, there is a basis on which the appellant could be convicted of the charges
    against him, in accordance with the <em>Mabior</em> standard, depending on how
    the evidence played out at new trials.  It is therefore not axiomatic that a
    stay of proceedings should be granted in cases of this kind.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, I am persuaded that several compelling factors justify a stay order in
    respect of both proceedings against the appellant.  First, the appellant has
    fully served and complied with all components of his sentences.  Second, the hearing
    of his appeals was twice adjourned pending the release of <em>Mabior </em>and <em>D.C.</em>  
    As a result, the appellant has been engaged in the appeal process for about
    three years, with the ever-present stigma of his convictions throughout. 
    Finally, and importantly, the Crown now professionally and appropriately consents
    to the requested stay orders.  As I understood Crown counsels submissions, the
    Crown acknowledges that stay orders in these cases are warranted in the
    interests of the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these specific circumstances, I would accede to the joint request of the Crown
    and the defence that stay orders be granted.  In my view, both fairness and the
    public interest are served by this outcome.  </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>VI.     Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would allow the appeals, set aside
    the appellants convictions and grant a stay of each proceeding.  As agreed by
    the parties, I would also direct that the appellants name be removed forthwith
    from the provincial sex offender registry (Christophers Law) and from SOIRA,
    that the sample of the appellants DNA previously provided be destroyed
    forthwith, and that the convictions and charges also be removed forthwith from
    the appellants vulnerable sector check.</p>
