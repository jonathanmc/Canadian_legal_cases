  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the decision of the Summary Convictions
    Appeal Court, dated January 17, 2012, by Justice Donald J. Gordon of the
    Superior Court of Justice, with reasons reported at 2012 ONSC 427, dismissing
    the appeal from the conviction entered on November 25, 2010 by Justice Margaret
    F. Woolcott of the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Lauwers J.A.
    (Dissenting):</b></p>
  <p class=Heading>I.        Overview</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael Fernandes was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while
    disqualified from doing so, contrary to s. 259(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 260(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> requires that if a court
    makes a driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em>, it must give the
    offender notice pursuant to the terms of that section.  In particular, the
    offender must be notified that breaching the prohibition order carries penal
    consequences under s. 259(4).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown conceded at trial and before the summary conviction appeal
    judge that Mr. Fernandes did not receive a s. 260(1)-compliant notice with
    respect to both the prohibition order imposed on October 11, 2005 and with
    respect to the provincial driving suspensions issued on February 26, 2003 and
    on May 2, 2005.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Molina</em>, 2008 ONCA 212, 90 O.R. (3d) 223, this court held
    that compliance with s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> is a pre-condition to a
    conviction for driving while disqualified under s. 259(4).  Following <em>Molina</em>,
    the Crown modified the <em>Code</em> prohibition forms given to offenders to
    include the notice requirements of s. 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A disqualification is defined in s. 259(5) as either a driving
    prohibition order under the <em>Criminal Code</em>, or a provincial driving
    suspension consequent upon a conviction under the <em>Code</em>.  In most
    cases, a <em>Criminal Code</em> driving prohibition will automatically be
    followed by a parallel provincial driving suspension, by the operation of s.
    41(1) of the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (the <em>HTA</em>). 
    The <em>Molina </em>case concerned a driving prohibition order under the <em>Criminal
    Code</em><i> </i>rather than a provincial driving suspension.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case is about whether the Crown must comply with the procedural
    requirements of s. 260(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> where it relies only on
    a provincial drivers licence suspension as proof of the disqualification and
    does not rely on the <em>Code</em> driving prohibition in order to ground the
    prosecution for the subsequent offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fernandes seeks leave to appeal his conviction.  For the reasons set
    out below, I would grant leave to appeal, and allow the appeal.  I would set
    aside the conviction and acquit Mr. Fernandes.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>II.       Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts are not in dispute.  On January 11, 2010, Mr. Fernandes was
    operating a motor vehicle in Waterloo while disqualified from doing so.  He was
    arrested and charged with driving while disqualified under s. 259(4).  The
    Crown elected to proceed by way of summary conviction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the offence at issue in this case, Mr. Fernandes had
    driving restrictions under s. 41(1) of the <em>HTA</em>.  The Ontario Ministry
    of Transportation had twice imposed a lifetime driving suspension against Mr.
    Fernandes, on February 26, 2003 and on May 2, 2005.  The provincial licence
    suspensions arose from driving-related offences under the <em>Code</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 11, 2005, following <em>Criminal Code</em> convictions for impaired
    driving, dangerous driving and driving while disqualified from doing so, the
    Ontario Court of Justice imposed a lifetime driving prohibition on Mr. Fernandes. 
    The Crown conceded at trial in 2010 in this case that, when the prohibition was
    imposed, Mr. Fernandes was not given notice of the terms of s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>,
    as required by s. 260(1).  Under <em>Molina</em>, therefore, that prohibition
    order itself could not be the basis for a conviction under s. 259(4).</p>
  <p class=Heading>III. Relevant Statutory Provisions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    41(1) of the <em>HTA</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b>41.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to
    subsections 41.1 (1), (2) and (3), the drivers licence of a person who is
    convicted of an offence,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b.1) under section 253 or 255 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> (Canada) committed while,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(i) driving or having the care, charge or control
    of a motor vehicle or street car within the meaning of this Act . . .</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>is thereupon suspended,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(f) upon the first conviction, for one year;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(g) upon the first subsequent conviction, for
    three years; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(h) upon the second subsequent conviction or an
    additional subsequent conviction, indefinitely. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    259(4) and (5) of the <em>Code</em> provide:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(4)&nbsp;Every offender who operates a motor vehicle
    ... while disqualified from doing so, ...</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;is guilty of an indictable
    offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;is guilty of an offence
    punishable on summary conviction.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(5)&nbsp;For the purposes of this section, <i>disqualification</i> means</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;a prohibition from operating a
    motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft or any railway equipment ordered pursuant to
    any of subsections (1), (2) and (3.1) to (3.4); or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;a disqualification or any other
    form of legal restriction of the right or privilege to operate a motor vehicle
    . . . imposed</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote align=left style='text-align:left'>          (i)&nbsp;in
    the case of a motor vehicle, under the law of a         province,</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    260(1) of the <em>Code</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b>260.</b>&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;If a court makes a
    prohibition order under section 259 in relation to an offender, it shall cause</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(<em>a</em>)&nbsp;the order to be read by or to
    the offender;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(<em>b</em>)&nbsp;a copy of the order to be given
    to the offender; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(<em>c</em>)&nbsp;the offender to be informed of
    subsection 259(4).</p>
  <p class=Heading>IV.     The Trial</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial before Woolcott J. of the Ontario Court of Justice proceeded by way of
    admitted facts.  The parties agreed that Mr. Fernandes had not been given
    notice that complied with s. 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 13, 2003, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation had mailed to Mr. Fernandess
    last known address a lifetime driving suspension, arising out of an impaired
    driving conviction under the <em>Code</em>.  Mr. Fernandes acknowledged that he
    had received the notification and was aware of its content.  The provincial
    notice stated the reason for the suspension and cited s. 253 of the <em>Code </em>under
    which Mr. Fernandes had been convicted.  The trial judge found that this notice
    did not inform Mr. Fernandes about the possible consequences under s. 259(4)
    and thus did not comply with s. 260(1).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown conceded that the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>prohibition
    was fatally flawed because it failed to inform Mr. Fernandes of his jeopardy
    and that it could therefore not rely on the <em>Code</em><i> </i>prohibition to
    ground the prosecution.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue at trial, therefore, was whether Mr. Fernandes could be convicted of
    driving while disqualified pursuant to s. 259(4) when the Crown could not prove
    compliance with s. 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown took the position that it was entitled to rely on a provincial driving
    suspension to ground the prosecution despite non-compliance with s.&nbsp;260(1)
    of the <em>Code</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence took the position that the Crown must comply with s. 260(1) whether it
    relies on the driving prohibition under the <em>Code</em> or on the licence
    suspension imposed under provincial law.  Counsel argued that it would be
    contrary to the mandatory nature of s. 260(1) and to the ruling of this court
    in <em>Molina</em> to permit the Crown to circumvent compliance with s. 260(1)
    by proceeding on the provincial suspension.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge distinguished this courts decision in <em>Molina </em>on the basis
    that it only applies where the driving disqualification relied on by the Crown is
    a<i> <em>Code</em></i> prohibition under s. 259(5)(a).  In Mr. Fernandess
    case, however, the Crown relied on the provincial driving suspension for the disqualification
    under s.&nbsp;259(5)(b)(i).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that the Crown had made out its case because the provincial licence
    suspension operates independently as a disqualification under s. 259(5)(b)(i).  She
    found that the notice requirements of s. 260(1) do not apply to a prosecution
    under the<i> <em>Code</em></i> derived from a provincial driving suspension,
    and convicted Mr. Fernandes.</p>
  <p class=Heading>V.      The Reasons of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    before the single appeal judge took the same respective positions as they had
    at trial. The summary conviction appeal judge dismissed Mr. Fernandess appeal
    from his conviction.  He set out his analysis briefly:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>16 </b>    I agree with Mr. Parry as to section 259(4) being
    the only offence provision for &quot;driving while disqualified&quot;. I do not
    accept his argument that the trial judge relied on section 259(5) as the
    offence section. Rather, section 259(5) merely allows the disqualification to
    be proved in one of two ways, a court ordered prohibition or a provincially
    imposed suspension. In this respect, I am in agreement with the analysis of the
    trial judge.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>17 </b>    Section 260(1) refers only to the requirements
    pertaining to a court ordered prohibition. It does not speak to a provincial
    suspension.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>18 </b>    I have some difficulty in understanding why
    Parliament felt it necessary for an offender to be fully informed of the
    consequences in section 259(4) regarding a court order but not with a
    provincial suspension. Nevertheless, the statutory provisions are clear and
    unambiguous. If this was not Parliament's intent then it is their role, not
    mine, to amend the statute.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>19 </b>    There is no complaint as to the notice of the
    provincial suspension. Mr. Fernandes acknowledges receiving that document.
    Section 260(4) and (5) are, thus, the operative provisions.</p>
  <p class=Heading>VI.     Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Fernandes seeks leave to appeal his conviction to this court under s.&nbsp;839
    of the <em>Code</em>.  He again takes the position that compliance with s. 260(1)
    of the <em>Code</em> as prescribed by this court in <em>Molina</em> is a
    condition precedent to any prosecution under s. 259(4) whether the accused was
    disqualified under the <em>Code </em>or under a provincial statute.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown renews its submission that s. 260(1), on its face, applies only to a <em>Code</em> prohibition order and not to a provincial suspension, and argues that <em>Molina</em> does not apply to cases where the Crown relies exclusively on a provincial
    driving suspension for the prosecution.</p>

avoid'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. R.R.</em>, 2008 ONCA 497, 90 O.R. (3d) 641, this court set
    out the test for granting leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the <em>Code</em>. 
    Doherty J.A. stated, at para. 37, that leave should be granted sparingly; although
    there is no single litmus test that can identify all cases in which leave
    should be granted,  he identified the significance of the legal issues raised
    to the general administration of criminal justice, and the merits of the
    proposed grounds of appeal as the two key variables.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty
    J.A. explained the relationship between these variables at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>On the one hand, if the issues have significance to the
    administration of justice beyond the particular case, then leave to appeal may
    be granted even if the merits are not particularly strong, though the grounds
    must at least be arguable.&nbsp; On the other hand, where the merits appear
    very strong, leave to appeal may be granted even if the issues have no general
    importance, especially if the convictions in issue are serious and the
    applicant is facing a significant deprivation of his or her liberty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find that this case raises an issue of significance to the administration of
    criminal justice beyond this particular case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    because the issue did not arise in <em>Molina</em>, this courts decision did
    not address whether the obligation to comply with s. 260(1) also applies to a
    provincial disqualification. Although, following <em>Molina</em> in 2008, the
    Crown modified prohibition orders to comply with s. 260(1), there are still
    offenders who are subject to non-compliant <em>Code</em> prohibition orders. A
    similar defence was successfully asserted, for example, in <em>R. v. Cobb</em>,
    [2011] O.J. No. 6307. There may well be other cases wending their way through
    the system.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the result seems incongruous; as pointed out by the summary conviction appeal
    judge, it is difficult to understand why Parliament would want an offender to
    be fully informed of the consequences in s. 259(4) for breaching a <em>Code</em> prohibition, but not for a provincial suspension, when the penal consequences
    for the offender are the same.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, there is a need for this court to rule and resolve the
    issue. I am therefore satisfied that this case satisfies the <em>R.R.</em><i> </i>test. 
    I would grant Mr. Fernandes leave to appeal from the decision of the summary
    conviction appeal judge.</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Merits</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    addressing the merits specifically, it would be useful to review the
    legislative history of the <em>Code</em> sections in issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>The Legislative
    History</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The current driving while disqualified provisions were enacted in 1985,
    in response to the Supreme Courts ruling in <em>R. v. Boggs</em>, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
    49. The former section provided:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b>283 (3) </b>Every one who drives a motor vehicle
    in Canada while he is disqualified or prohibited from driving a motor vehicle
    by reason of the legal suspension or cancellation, in any province, of his
    permit or license or of his right to secure a permit or license to drive a
    motor vehicle in that province is guilty of</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) an indictable offence and is liable to
    imprisonment for two years or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court held in <em>Boggs</em> that Parliament had no power to
    criminalize a provincial licence suspension when that suspension was imposed
    for a reason unrelated to a criminal highway traffic offence. <em>Boggs</em><i> </i>mandates that the predicate offence underlying a provincial
    disqualification referred to in s.&nbsp;259(5)(b) must<i> <em>always</em> </i>be
    a <em>Code </em>offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is plain from the way that Estey J. framed the issue in <em>Boggs</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The issue then is reached, can Parliament validly exercise its
    criminal power under s. 91(27) by attaching penal consequences by means of a
    Criminal Code provision (here s. 238(3)) to a breach of an order made
    administratively or judicially under a valid provincial statute, without any
    necessary relationship to the conduct that led to such an order?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Courts answer was negative; it was not open to Parliament to
    criminalize a provincial suspension imposed for a regulatory purpose. Estey J.
    then turned his mind to the repair, noting that: if the federal prohibition
    were limited to suspensions brought about by a conviction under specified or
    unspecified <em>Code</em> provisions, the link to public order and safety would
    be more apparent<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament
    appears to have taken the Supreme Courts advice in <em>Boggs</em>, as is shown
    in the debates during the second reading in the House of Commons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>We know dozens of cases of people whose licences have been
    lifted by the provincial authorities but who drive and are picked up again. We
    will create a new offence of driving while disqualified. We expect that the
    wording of the new offence will rectify the problems that were presented by the
    Supreme Court of Canada decision in the case of <em>Boggs v. The Queen</em>,
    where the Supreme Court ruled that the current offence of driving while
    disqualified was <em>ultra vires</em>, beyond our power, because the criminal
    sanction could be imposed for the violation of a provincial licence suspension
    pursuant to a conviction for a non-criminal highway traffic offence. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In order to get around that, the new offence will apply only to
    violations of a new judicial order of prohibition which is contained in this
    legislation, upon which I will expand later, and violations of provincial
    licence suspensions that are imposed pursuant to a criminal driving offence.<a

  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>That prohibition will apply all across Canada. It will be
    superimposed. It will not depend upon penalties or restrictions which
    provincial registrars of motor vehicles may impose. They could still impose
    what penalties or restrictions they like. This will be superimposed over any
    penalty they may wish to impose. There will be no exceptions to the rule. Every
    drinking driver will have to be made aware of the risk of the loss of the
    privilege to drive.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the progress of the legislation manifested two parliamentary concerns. 
    The first was to repair the constitutional deficiency identified in <em>Boggs</em> in order to permit the provincial driving disqualification regime to continue
    to dovetail with the <em>Criminal Code</em>, but only for criminal driving
    offences, as is seen in s. 259(5).  The second was that notice obligations were
    to be imposed on the court when the sentence included a driving prohibition<em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, as is seen in s</span></em>. 260(1).   </p>
  <p class=Heading><em>R. v. Molina </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the trial decision in <em>R. v. Molina</em>, 215 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. S.C.),
    Glithero J. described the purpose of s. 260(1) at para. 23:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In enacting Section 260(1), Parliament presumably recognized
    the serious nature of consequences applicable following a conviction for
    driving while prohibited, and saw fit to make it mandatory that offenders who
    are prohibited from operating a vehicle are made aware of the serious sanctions
    which may attach if they drive in contravention of that order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, this court emphasized the rationale behind and the importance of
    complying with s. 260(1), at para. 23:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The requirement that an offender disqualified from driving be
    &quot;informed of subsection 259(4)&quot; means more than that the offender be
    simply advised of its existence; &quot;informed&quot; means that the details of
    the significant penal exposure triggered by the application of that section
    must be brought home to the offender. Nothing less than that prerequisite is an
    element of the offence of driving while disqualified. Informing an offender
    about the penal consequences of a breach is not simply a routine formality or
    procedural detail.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Interpretation of s. 260(1)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span

    pros- ecutions under s. 259(4), being those for which the Crown relies
    exclusively on a provincial driving suspension, the informative purposes of s.
    260(1) would not be accomplished. The penal consequences that Mr. Fernandes
    faces are no less serious than those faced by Mr. Molina. Can this result have
    been Parliaments intent?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    260(4)(6) relate to the proof in court of the existence of a provincial
    driving disqualification for a driving offence committed under the <em>Code,</em> and have nothing to do with ss. (1)(3). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    contrast, ss. 260(1)(3) relate only to a prohibition order made under s.&nbsp;259
    in the context of a <em>Code</em> driving offence.  Section 260(1) is a
    mandatory instruction to the court on the making of a prohibition order that is
    designed to ensure that the offender has clear notice of the prohibition order
    itself and of the consequences of a subsequent conviction that are specified in
    s. 259(4).  The offender is expected to sign a copy of the order under s.
    260(2), but if that does not occur, the order is still valid according to s.
    260(3).  It is plain from <em>Molina</em> that the validity of a prohibition
    order depends on strict compliance with s. 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interplay of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and the <em>HTA</em> creates several
    complexities.  It is clear, however, that a provincial disqualification that
    results from the breach of a provincial law alone does not expose the offender
    to prosecution under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>. This is the result of the
    legislative repair prompted by <em>Boggs</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>;</span></em> constitutionally, the provincial disqualification must be based on a <em>Criminal
    Code</em> conviction to ground a prosecution under s. 259(4).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    259(4) implicitly contemplates several categories of offences.  For some
    offences the sentencing court must impose a driving prohibition to which s.&nbsp;260(1)
    of the <em>Code</em> would apply, such as the offences listed in s. 259(1),
    259(3.1)  street racing, s. 259(3.2)  bodily harm, s. 259(3.3)  causing
    death, and s. 259(3.4)  mandatory life prohibition.  For other offences, s.
    259(2) gives the sentencing court discretion to impose a prohibition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are, therefore, several categories of offenders who are open to prosecution
    under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>. First, an offender might be under a
    provincial disqualification imposed by the <em>HTA </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>for a </span>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> offence and also be </span></em>subject to a simultaneous
    mandatory or discretionary driving prohibition under the <em>Code</em>. The
    prosecution could rely on either or both s. 259(5)(a) or s.&nbsp;259(5)(b)(i) to
    ground the prosecution, and could use ss. 260(4)(6) to prove the provincial
    disqualification for a subsequent offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the period of an offenders provincial disqualification that results from a <em>Code</em> conviction might exceed the period of the driving prohibition under the <em>Code</em>.
    Section 259(4), in conjunction with s. 259(5)(b)(i), makes driving while
    disqualified under provincial law a criminal offence. Here too, the prosecution
    could only rely on s. 259(5)(b)(i) to ground the prosecution, and could use ss.
    260(4)(6) to prove the provincial disqualification for a subsequent offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    an offender might be under a provincial disqualification imposed by the <em>HTA </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>for a </span>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> offence</span></em> even though the offender was not
    subject to a driving prohibition under the <em>Code</em>. The prosecution could
    only rely on s.&nbsp;259(5)(b)(i) to ground the prosecution, and could use ss.
    260(4)(6) to prove the provincial disqualification for a subsequent offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crowns case depends heavily on the opening words of s. 260(1), viz: If a
    court makes a prohibition order.  The Crown argues that the prosecution need
    only prove compliance with s. 260(1) if it is prosecuting for a breach of the
    prohibition order under s. 259(4), but need not prove compliance with s. 260(1)
    if it is prosecuting under the <em>Code</em> for a provincial
    disqualification.  In short, when the required notice of the prohibition is
    deficient under s. 260(1), as the Crown admits it was in this case, the Crown argues
    that it can entirely side-step the notice requirement by proceeding with proof of
    the provincial disqualification under ss. 260(4)(6). This, the Crown asserts,
    is the plain meaning of the opening words of s. 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view this result does not follow.  The obligation to comply with s.&nbsp;260(1)
    where a driving prohibition is imposed under the<i> <em>Code</em></i> is
    plain.  That obligation cannot, in my view, be overcome by a procedural dodge. 
    The Crowns position exemplifies, to my mind, a category confusion that perhaps
    derives from the drafting of s. 260 as a whole. The confusion is between what constitutes
    the offence, and how the offence is to be proven. Sections 260(1)(3) impose a
    substantive obligation on the convicting court, and its failure to comply
    carries the consequence of impairing the next prosecution, as the court found
    in <em>Molina</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, neither the wording of the provisions nor the legislative history
    gives evidence that Parliament intended to provide an exemption from strict compliance
    with the notice requirements in s. 260(1) where the prosecution is based on a
    provincial driving disqualification derived from a predicate <em>Criminal Code</em> conviction in which a driving prohibition was imposed. Whenever a driving
    prohibition under the <em>Code</em><i> </i>was imposed, the Crown must prove compliance
    with s. 260(1) to ground a prosecution under s. 259(4) for a subsequent offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is sufficient to address the first two categories of cases referred to earlier,
    the first being offenders subject to both a <em>Code</em><i> </i>driving
    prohibition and a provincial suspension, and the second being offenders whose <em>Code</em> prohibition has lapsed but who are still subject to a provincial suspension.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third category of cases comprises those offenders who were convicted of a <em>Code</em> driving offence and who are subject to a provincial suspension, but who were never
    subject to a <em>Code</em> driving prohibition. In those cases the Crown need
    not prove compliance with s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> to succeed in a prosecution
    under s. 259(4). This reflects the legislative policy choice by which the <em>Code</em> simply respects and advances the provincial licence suspension as ancillary to
    the <em>Code</em> punishment, since the provincial suspension does not suffer
    from the <em>Boggs</em> constitutional infirmity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the canons of statutory interpretation support this result. In <em>Re
    Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, the Supreme
    Court of Canada set out the preferred approach to statutory interpretation in
    Canada, in both the civil and criminal law domains, articulated by Elmer
    Driedger in <em>Construction of Statutes</em> (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Today there is only one principle
    or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context
    and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
    Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court elaborated, in <em>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership</em> <em>v.
    Rex</em>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 26-27:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The preferred approach recognizes the important role that
    context must inevitably play when a court construes the written words of a
    statute: as Professor John Willis incisively noted in his seminal article
    Statute Interpretation in a Nutshell (1938), 16 <em>Can. Bar Rev.</em> 1, at
    p. 6, words, like people, take their colour from their surroundings.

class=verdana>he Supreme Court has emphasized that a purposive analysis should
    include locating the mischief the legislation was meant to cure: </span><em>St.
    Pierre</em><span class=verdana> at para. 90. </span>In my view, the Crowns
    interpretation of ss. 259(4) and (5) would frustrate the purpose of s. 260(1):
    to ensure that an individual who is subject to a <em>Code</em> prohibition
    understands at the moment of sentencing for the predicate offence, the jeopardy
    that he or she will face for driving while disqualified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    practical purposes the Crown would be capable of circumventing the requirements
    of s. 260(1) by relying on a parallel provincial driving suspension.  Such an
    interpretation would render s. 260(1) superfluous. <span class=verdana>Parliament
    is presumed not to speak superfluously: see, </span><em>e.g.</em>,<span
class=verdana> </span><em>R. v. Middleton</em><span class=verdana>, 2009 SCC
    21, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 674, at para. 17.</span> In my opinion, it would be wrong
    to construe s. 260(1) as only applying to a prosecution relying directly on a <em>Code</em><i> </i>prohibition but not on a provincial suspension even though it occurred in
    conjunction with an offence that drew a <em>Code</em><i> </i>prohibition as
    part of the sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=verdana>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An additional canon of statutory interpretation is that if there
    are two equally plausible constructions of a penal statute, the court should
    prefer the interpretation that is more favourable to an accused.  As penal
    legislation, s.&nbsp;260(1) must be construed with that principle in mind.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, adopting the Crowns proposed interpretation would be unfair to an
    accused.  The Crown would then have two options: first, to ground a prosecution
    under s. 259(4) in a <em>Code</em> prohibition, in which case the Crown <em>must</em> demonstrate compliance with s. 260(1) per <em>Molina</em> and warn the accused
    of his or her jeopardy; or second, to ground the prosecution in a provincial
    suspension, in which case the Crown would not be bound by the
    otherwise-mandatory commands of s. 260(1). Parliament has not provided a clear
    indication that it intended such a result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore conclude that where the sentencing court in the prior
    conviction imposed a driving prohibition, the requirements of s. 260(1)
    constitute a precondition to a conviction under s. 259(4), even when the Crown
    relies on a provincial suspension to prove the earlier offence. Since the Crown
    in this case failed to prove that Mr. Fernandes was provided with the requisite
    notice, the conviction cannot stand.</p>

    have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Lauwers J.A.  Like my
    colleague, I view this appeal as raising an important issue of statutory
    interpretation that has significance to the administration of criminal justice
    beyond the four corners of this particular case.  I therefore agree that the
    test for leave to appeal to this court set out in <em>R.R.</em> is satisfied in
    this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with Lauwers J.A.s description of the origins and legislative
    history of ss. 259(4), 259(5) and 260(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>  the
    statutory provisions at issue.  However, with respect, I disagree with his
    conclusion, at para. 51, that compliance with s. 260(1) is required to ground a
    prosecution under s. 259(4) where the prosecution is based on a provincial
    driving disqualification derived from a predicate <em>Criminal Code</em> conviction in which a driving prohibition was imposed under the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the current language and scheme of the relevant statutory provisions, it is
    my opinion that where a s. 259(4) prosecution is based on a
    provincially-imposed driving disqualification within the meaning of
    s.&nbsp;259(5)(b)(i) of the <em>Code</em>, rather than a driving prohibition
    order as contemplated by s.&nbsp;259(5)(a), the Crown is not required to
    demonstrate compliance with s. 260(1).  In these circumstances, in my view,
    s.&nbsp;260(1) is not engaged.   </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:

    of the <em>Code</em>.  In material part, these provisions state: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>259. (4)  Every offender who operates a motor vehicle  in
    Canada while disqualified from doing so </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(<em>a</em>) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable

  <p class=CQuote>259.   (5) For the purposes of this section, disqualification
    means</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(<em>a</em>) a prohibition from operating a motor vehicle

  <p class=DSubquote>(b)  a copy of the order to be given to the offender; and</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, ss. 260(4) and (5) of the <em>Code</em> set out the means for proving
    notice and the contents of a provincially-imposed driving disqualification,
    respectively.  Under s. 260(5), provincial registrars certificates are
    admissible as evidence of provincial driving disqualifications.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:115%;page-break-after:avoid'>II.       The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of this court in <em>Molina</em> must also be addressed on this
    appeal.  In <em>Molina</em>, this court considered whether compliance with s.
    260(1) is a pre-condition to a conviction for driving while disqualified under
    s. 259(4) where the driving disqualifications at issue were driving
    prohibitions ordered under the <em>Code</em>.  In <em>Molina</em>, the language
    of the relevant prohibition orders did not include notice to three accused of
    s.&nbsp;259(4) of the <em>Code</em>, as required by s. 260(1)(c).  As a result
    of this deficiency in the prohibition orders, this court held that the Crown
    had failed to prove an essential element of the offence of driving while
    disqualified.  Consequently, the convictions entered for that offence against
    the three accused could not stand.  I will return to the significance of <em>Molina</em> later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>III.      The Trial  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as in <em>Molina</em>, the appellant was charged with driving a
    motor vehicle while disqualified from doing so, contrary to s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>. 
    At the time of the predicate offence, the appellant was subject to several
    driving prohibitions, ordered under the <em>Code</em> at various times, in
    respect of various driving-related offences.  These included a lifetime
    prohibition order made following the appellants convictions for impaired
    driving, dangerous driving and driving while disqualified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
    at the time of the predicate offence, the appellant was subject to several
    driving suspensions or restrictions imposed by Ontarios Ministry of
    Transportation on the authority of the <em>HTA</em>.  These included a lifetime
    driving suspension imposed under the <em>HTA</em> as a result of the appellants
    convictions for two counts of impaired driving under s. 253 of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown conceded that the appellants driving prohibition orders under
    the <em>Code</em> failed to comply with the notice requirements set out under
    s.&nbsp;260(1) of the <em>Code</em>.  In particular, as in <em>Molina</em>,
    none of the appellants prohibition orders contained the warning contemplated
    by s. 260(1)(c) regarding s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    unlike the prosecutions in <em>Molina</em>, the Crown in this case did not rely
    on the deficient driving prohibition orders imposed under the <em>Code</em>. 
    Rather, the Crowns case against the appellant rested on proof of driving while
    disqualified from doing so by reason of a driving suspension imposed under
    provincial law, as contemplated under s. 259(5)(b)(i).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the critical issue at trial was whether the s.&nbsp;260(1)
    notice requirements apply to a prosecution for the offence of driving while
    disqualified under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>, where the prosecution is
    based on a driving disqualification imposed under provincial law.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    positions of the parties at trial were straightforward.  The defence argued
    that compliance with s. 260(1) is mandatory, even where the Crown seeks to
    prove the offence of driving while disqualified under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em> exclusively in reliance on a valid provincial driving suspension or
    restriction.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown countered that compliance with s. 260(1), including s.&nbsp;260(1)(c), is
    not obligatory where the driving disqualification at issue is established by
    proof of a provincial driving suspension.  It was undisputed that the appellant
    had received proper notice of the provincial suspension and that it was in
    effect on the date of the charged offence.  The Crown, therefore, maintained
    that the requisite driving disqualification was proven in accordance with s.
    260(5) of the <em>Code</em>, regardless of non-compliance with s. 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted the Crowns position for several reasons.  First, she held
    that s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> addresses the procedure to be followed upon
    issuing a prohibition order pursuant to s. 259.  The trial judge emphasized
    that failure to comply with the requirements of s.&nbsp;260(1) does not vitiate
    a conviction for impaired driving under s. 253 of the <em>Code</em>, the
    underlying conviction in this case.  Rather, the conviction stands but, on the
    basis of <em>Molina</em>, the prohibition order cannot be relied upon by the
    Crown under s.&nbsp;259(5)(a) as a driving disqualification for the purpose
    of a s. 259(4) prosecution.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the <em>HTA</em> provides for a different regulatory regime for driving license
    suspensions.  Where, as here, a suspension is imposed because an accused has
    been convicted of a <em>Code </em>offence (<em>e.g.</em> impaired driving under
    s.&nbsp;253), the suspension is unaffected by what may have occurred in respect
    of a prohibition order under the <em>Code</em> arising from the same underlying
    criminal offence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in the trial judges view, s. 259(5) provides two separate routes to proving a
    driving disqualification, only one of which (s. 259(5)(a)) is contingent on
    compliance with s. 260(1).  In respect of s. 259(5)(b), the trial judge
    observed:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If it were contingent on compliance with section 260(1) then it
    would seem that section 259(5)(b) would be unnecessary since it would merely duplicate
    section 259(5)(a) in the case where [s. 259](5)(b) is contingent on proof that
    the reason for the suspension is based on a <em>Criminal Code</em> conviction
    under <em>Criminal Code</em> sections.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge held that the relevant statutory language is unambiguous.  It
    does not contemplate or provide that compliance with s. 260(1) is a
    prerequisite to a conviction for driving while disqualified based on a driving
    suspension imposed under provincial law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge held that <em>Molina</em> is inapplicable in this case.  She
    concluded that <em>Molina</em> is confined to factually similar cases, namely,
    prosecutions for driving while disqualified based on driving prohibition orders
    under the <em>Code</em>, as envisaged by s. 259(5)(a) of the <em>Code</em>.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge convicted the appellant of driving while disqualified, contrary
    to s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>, based on proof by the Crown that the
    appellant was subject to a valid provincial driving suspension of which he
    admittedly had proper notice at the time of the charged offence.</p>
  <p class=Heading>IV.     The Summary Conviction Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to the Superior Court, the appellant renewed his argument that in order
    for the Crown to make out a charge of driving while disqualified under
    s.&nbsp;259(4) of the <em>Code</em>, compliance with s. 260(1) is required.  He
    submitted that compliance with s. 260(1), including s. 260(1)(c), is an
    essential element of an offence under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>, whether
    the driving disqualification relied upon by the Crown is a driving prohibition
    order under the <em>Code</em> (s. 259(5)(a)) or a driving suspension or
    restriction imposed under provincial law (s. 259(5)(b)(i)).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    summary conviction appeal court judge disagreed.  He upheld the trial judges
    ruling that compliance with s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> is not a prerequisite
    to a conviction under s. 259(4) where the Crown establishes a driving
    disqualification under s. 259(5)(b)(i) by proof of a valid, provincially-issued,
    driving suspension.  He held: (1) that the relevant statutory provisions are
    clear and unambiguous; (2) that s. 259(5) allows a driving disqualification to
    be proved in two ways  by proof of a <em>Code</em> driving prohibition or a
    provincially-imposed driving suspension; (3) that s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> applies only to <em>Code</em> driving prohibitions; and (4) that <em>Molina</em> deals only with driving prohibitions ordered under the <em>Code</em>. 
    Accordingly, he dismissed the appellants conviction appeal for reasons similar
    to those of the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>V.      Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is one issue on appeal: Is compliance with s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em>,
    including s. 260(1)(c), a prerequisite to a conviction under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em> for the offence of driving while disqualified where the prosecution is based on
    a provincial driving disqualification imposed as a result of a conviction for a <em>Criminal Code</em> offence where a driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em> was also imposed? </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>VI.     Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, both the trial and the summary conviction appeal court judges
    concluded that compliance with s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> is not a
    necessary prerequisite to a successful s. 259(4) prosecution for the offence of
    driving while disqualified where the driving disqualification relied upon by
    the Crown is a valid driving suspension or restriction imposed under provincial
    law.  In other words, compliance with s. 260(1) is not an essential element of
    the offence of driving while disqualified under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em> where the Crown invokes s. 259(5)(b)(i) to prove the alleged driving
    disqualification.  For the following reasons, I agree.</p>
  <h4>(1)     Proper Interpretation of Sections 259(5) and 260(1) </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Lauwers J.A. notes, the Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly endorsed the
    modern approach to statutory interpretation set out in E.A. Driedger, <em>Construction
    of Statutes</em>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), at p. 87.  This
    approach requires that the words of legislation, including criminal law
    legislation, be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
    ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act,
    and the intention of Parliament: <em>R. v. Tse</em>, 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1
    S.C.R. 531; <em>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</em>, 2002 SCC 42,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559; <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R
    27.  This approach must guide the interpretation of ss. 259(5) and 260(1) of
    the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    recognized by the trial and summary conviction appeal court judges,
    s.&nbsp;259(5) of the <em>Code</em> contemplates different forms of driving
    disqualifications.  Under s. 259(5), a disqualification from operating a motor
    vehicle within the meaning of s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em> may be established
    in one or both of two ways:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=Underline>under s. 259(5)(a)</span>, on proof of a prohibition from
    operating a motor vehicle  ordered pursuant to any of [ss. 259](1), (2) and
    (3.1) to (3.4) of the Code; <em>and/or</em> </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=Underline>under s. 259(5)(b)(i)</span>, on proof of a disqualification
    or any other form of legal restriction of the right or privilege to operate a
    motor vehicle  imposed  under the law of a province</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>in respect of a conviction or discharge under s. 730
    of any offence referred to in any of ss. 259(1), (2) and (3.1) to (3.4).  The
    latter sections of the <em>Code </em>provide for the imposition of a driving
    prohibition order, on either a mandatory or a discretionary basis, depending on
    the underlying criminal conviction at issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this fashion, s. 259(5) provides for two distinct means by which a driving
    disqualification may be demonstrated by the Crown for the purpose of
    prosecuting the offence of driving while disqualified under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>. 
    A disqualification may be established on proof of a <em>Code</em> driving
    prohibition order, a provincially-imposed driving suspension or restriction, or
    both.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    260(1) of the <em>Code</em>, in turn, sets out notice requirements regarding
    the jeopardy faced by an accused under s. 259(4) in the event of a conviction
    under that provision for the offence of operating a motor vehicle while
    disqualified from doing so.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    language of s. 260(1) is mandatory.  However, on a plain reading of
    s.&nbsp;260(1), the provision applies only if a court makes a <em>prohibition
    order</em> under s.&nbsp;259 in relation to an offender (emphasis added). 
    When s. 260(1) is read in context with s. 259(5)(a) and (b) and in the light of
    the words employed by Parliament in s. 260(1), the term prohibition order
    refers only to a driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read his draft reasons, Lauwers J.A. agrees with this interpretation of s.
    260(1).  However, he would hold that, [w]henever a driving prohibition under
    the <em>Code</em> was imposed, the Crown must prove compliance with s. 260(1)
    to ground a prosecution under s. 259(4) for a subsequent offence.  In his
    view, this requirement applies, as a prerequisite to a conviction under s.
    259(4), whenever an offender is or was subject to both a <em>Code</em> driving
    prohibition order and a provincial driving suspension, even where the s. 259(4)
    prosecution is based only on the provincial driving suspension.  As I will
    elaborate later in these reasons, I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    regard the introductory language of s. 260(1)  [i]f a court makes a
    prohibition order under section 259 in relation to an offender  as evincing a
    clear and unambiguous expression of Parliaments intention regarding the scope
    of the requirements set out in s. 260(1).  Properly read, the requirements of
    s.&nbsp;260(1), including the notice requirement of s. 260(1)(c), apply only
    where the driving disqualification at issue is a prohibition order under the <em>Code</em>. 
    Where a prohibition order as defined by s. 259(5)(a) is made, s. 260(1)
    requires that the sentencing judge ensure that the offender is informed of the
    consequences of committing a subsequent offence under s. 259(4) <em>in relation
    to that prohibition order</em>.  Nothing in ss. 259(5) or 260(1) signifies an
    intention that the latter provision extend to a s. 259(4) prosecution based
    exclusively on a provincially-imposed driving suspension or restriction under
    the <em>HTA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    factors support this interpretive conclusion.  First, s. 260(1) follows
    immediately after s. 259(5), which, as I have already said, distinguishes on
    its face between two forms of driving disqualifications: those brought about by
    reason of driving prohibition orders under the <em>Code</em> and those effected
    by reason of a form of legal restriction of the right or privilege to operate a
    motor vehicle imposed under provincial law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet,
    s. 260(1) refers only to a prohibition order under [s.] 259.  Neither the
    English nor the French language versions of s. 260(1) refers to a driving
    disqualification imposed under provincial law.  Indeed, s. 260(1) makes no
    mention at all of a disqualification from operating a motor vehicle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
    had Parliament intended that the requirements of s. 260(1) apply to both forms
    of driving disqualification defined under s. 259(5), this could easily have
    been accomplished by the simple drafting device of using the word
    disqualification, rather than the words prohibition order, in s. 260(1).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    provisions of s. 260, apart from s. 260(1), do specifically refer to a
    provincial driving disqualification (<em>e.g.</em> ss. 260(4) and 260(5)). 
    Thus, s. 260 itself differentiates between prohibition orders and provincial
    driving disqualifications (suspensions or restrictions).  In my opinion, this
    differentiation reflects a deliberate intention to restrict the ambit of s.
    260(1) to those driving disqualifications brought about by reason of a driving
    prohibition order under the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the specific language of s. 260 as a whole, and s. 260(1) in particular, as
    well as the placement of s. 260(1) immediately after s. 259(5) in the <em>Code</em>,
    strongly suggest that s. 260(1) applies only to driving disqualifications in
    the form of prohibition orders made under the <em>Code</em>.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also important to emphasize that driving prohibition orders under the <em>Code</em>,
    and provincially-imposed driving suspensions or restrictions are different in
    character and serve discrete purposes.  Driving prohibition orders under the <em>Code</em> form part of a sentencing judges arsenal of sanctions on sentencing an accused
    for a criminal driving offence.  In some instances, the imposition of a driving
    prohibition order is mandatory for such a conviction; in other instances, it is
    a discretionary sanction that may be imposed by the sentencing judge when
    crafting a fit sentence: see ss. 259(1), (2) and (3.1) to (3.4) of the <em>Code</em>. 
    The important point is that, whenever imposed, a driving prohibition order
    under the <em>Code</em> is part of the penalty or punishment imposed for a
    criminal driving offence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, provincial driving suspensions or restrictions do not constitute any
    part of a penalty or punishment imposed by the criminal law.  Rather, they are
    a form of civil driving disability arising out of a conviction for a criminal
    offence.  I endorse Durno J.s observation in <em>R. v. Wilson</em>, 2011 ONSC
    89, 270 C.C.C. (3d) 110, at para. 29, citing<em> Prince Edward Island
    (Secretary) v. Egan</em>, [1941] S.C.R. 396: [t]he provincial suspension is
    not a sanction that is imposed in furtherance of the purposes and principles of
    sentencing  It is not part of the federal criminal law power and not imposed
    in furtherance of the purposes and principles of sentencing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Driving
    prohibition orders under the <em>Code</em> seek to facilitate the principles
    and objectives of sentencing in the criminal law.  In contrast,
    provincially-imposed driving suspensions or restrictions form part of, and seek
    to advance, the civil regulation of the use of highways.  Accordingly, they
    serve complementary, but distinct, statutory purposes and policy objectives.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This factor provides
    important context for the interpretation of ss. 259(5) and 260(1) of the <em>Code</em>. 
    It reinforces the view that Parliaments choice of language in s. 260(1) was
    neither inadvertent nor careless.  On the contrary, the introductory language
    of s. 260(1) implicitly differentiates between the types of driving
    disqualifications that may arise under either federal criminal law (driving
    prohibition orders) or provincial regulatory law (driving suspensions or
    restrictions).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One further
    factor aids the interpretation of ss. 259(5) and 260(1) of the <em>Code</em>. 
    The legislative history of these provisions is set out in Lauwers J.A.s
    reasons and need not be repeated here.  Suffice to say that I see nothing in
    the legislative history of ss. 259(4), 259(5) and 260(1) to compel a different
    interpretation of the reach of s. 260(1).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I conclude
    that there are several difficulties with a reading of s.&nbsp;260(1) of the <em>Code</em> that results in its application to driving while disqualified charges that rest
    on valid, provinciallyissued driving suspensions or restrictions simply
    because a <em>Code</em> prohibition order may also have been imposed.  In my
    opinion, to read s. 260(1) in this fashion would offend the express terms of s.&nbsp;260(1),
    ignore the distinction between the types of driving disqualifications expressly
    identified in s. 259(5) and implicitly recognized in s.&nbsp;260 and their
    discrete purposes, and unjustifiably expand the reach of s.&nbsp;260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor, in my view,
    does <em>Molina</em> dictate a contrary conclusion.  As Lauwers J.A. acknowledges
    and as I have already said, <em>Molina</em> involved compliance with s. 260(1)
    of the <em>Code</em> where the pertinent driving disqualifications were driving
    prohibitions ordered under the <em>Code</em>.  <em>Molina </em>was based on a
    straightforward reading and application of s. 260(1), for the purposes of
    assessing the sufficiency of the prohibition orders at issue.  Section 260(1),
    on the facts of <em>Molina</em>, was clearly engaged.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not this
    case.  Here, we are concerned with whether s. 260(1) applies to a driving
    disqualification imposed under provincial law.  <em>Molina </em>does not
    address or determine this issue.  </p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'>(2)     The Suggested Contrary
    Construction of </h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>          Sections 259(5) and
    260(1)</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having set out
    what I regard as the proper interpretation of ss. 259(5) and 260(1) of the <em>Code</em>,
    I turn now to Lauwers J.A.s reasoning in support of a contrary construction of
    these provisions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague, at
    para. 40, questions whether it was Parliaments intent, in introducing s.
    260(1) of the <em>Code</em>, to create a situation where the informative
    purposes of s. 260(1) would not be accomplished in respect of driving while
    disqualified charges based exclusively on provincial driving suspensions or restrictions. 
    He earlier characterizes this result, at para. 29, as incongruous and
    comments:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]t is difficult to understand why Parliament would want an
    offender to be fully informed of the consequences in s. 259(4) for breaching a
    Code prohibition, but not for a provincial suspension, when the penal
    consequences for the offender are the same.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lauwers J.A.
    goes on to describe, at paras. 46-48, various categories of offenders who, in
    his view, may be open to prosecution under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em>.  He
    posits three categories: (1) offenders who are subject to both a provincial
    driving disqualification and a driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em>;
    (2) offenders who are subject to a provincial driving disqualification of a
    duration that exceeds the term of a driving prohibition order imposed under the <em>Code</em>; and (3) offenders who are subject to a provincial driving
    disqualification but are not subject to a driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of
    offenders in the first two categories, Lauwers J.A. acknowledges the Crowns
    right to ground a s. 259(4) prosecution for driving while disqualified on a
    provincially-imposed driving disqualification, as contemplated under s.
    259(5)(b)(i).  However, he would hold that the obligation to comply with the notice
    requirements of s. 260(1) cannot be overcome by Crown reliance on what he
    describes as this type of procedural dodge.  In his view, compliance with s.
    260(1) is required whenever a <em>Code</em> prohibition order has been made,
    even if the prosecution is based, not on the prohibition order, but on a
    provincial driving suspension.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I
    do not agree for several reasons.  First, in my opinion, this construction of
    ss. 259(5) and 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> is inconsistent with the express
    terms of those provisions.  As I have already explained, these provisions
    distinguish between driving disqualifications effected by driving prohibition
    orders under the <em>Code</em> and provincial driving suspensions or
    restrictions.  This distinction is deliberate.  I agree with the summary
    conviction appeal court judge that s. 260(1) applies only when the prosecution
    rests on a court-ordered prohibition order under s. 259 of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have concluded
    that Parliament made the conscious decision to confine the requirements of s.
    260(1) to instances involving driving prohibitions ordered under the <em>Code</em>. 
    The effect of Lauwers J.A.s proposed interpretation of the interplay between
    ss.&nbsp;259(4), 259(5) and 260(1) is to expand the application of
    s.&nbsp;260(1) outside of that limited scope.  In my view, the language and
    scheme of ss. 259(4), 259(5) and 260(1) do not justify such an interpretive
    outcome.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as
    Lauwers J.A. implicitly recognizes, there is nothing improper or inappropriate
    in the Crowns seeking to prosecute an offender for a charge of driving while
    disqualified under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em> solely in reliance on a
    provincial driving disqualification, even where a prohibition order under the <em>Code</em> was also imposed.  Sections 259(4) and 259(5)(b)(i), read in combination, say
    as much.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since it is
    statutorily permissible for the Crown to proceed in this fashion, it can
    scarcely be said that the decision to do so is a procedural dodge intended to
    circumvent the application of s. 260(1).  It simply follows, as a matter of
    law, that on the Crowns election to proceed in reliance on a provincial
    driving disqualification, s. 260(1) does not apply.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the fact
    that s. 260(1) does not apply where the Crown elects to invoke s. 259(5)(b)(i)
    as the basis for a s. 259(4) driving while disqualified prosecution does not
    alter the statutory construction exercise.  The inapplicability of s. 260(1) in
    such circumstances is simply the legal consequence of the intended reach of s.
    260(1).  It is not a basis for avoiding the clear and unambiguous language of
    ss. 259(5) and 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, and
    importantly, to the extent that the application of s. 260(1) in this and
    similar cases might be viewed as a desirable outcome, it is for Parliament to
    effect that result by appropriate law reform measures.  It is not the function
    of this court to interpret s. 260(1) so as to apply to a wider class of
    offenders where to do so would run contrary to the express language used by Parliament. 
    And, as I have said, I see nothing in ss. 259(5) or 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> evincing a legislative intention that the s. 260(1) notice requirements are
    triggered where the prosecution rests on a provincial driving disqualification
    rather than a driving prohibition order made under the <em>Cod</em>e.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in my
    opinion, public policy considerations weigh against the interpretation of ss.
    259(5) and 260(1) advanced by Lauwers J.A.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament and the
    courts have long recognized that driving offences, particularly drinking and
    driving offences, are serious crimes with grave consequences.  Not
    infrequently, they result in significant societal damage and injury, often of a
    tragic and permanent nature.  In this context, driving while disqualified
    prosecutions assume great importance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The distinction
    drawn under ss. 259(5) and 260 of the <em>Code</em> between driving
    disqualifications established by prohibition orders under the <em>Code</em> and
    those arising from provincially-imposed driving suspensions or restrictions
    serves an important policy objective.  It enhances prosecutorial discretion by
    permitting the Crown to rely, in appropriate cases, solely on
    provincially-imposed driving disqualifications even where a prohibition order
    has been made under the <em>Code</em>.  In these circumstances, the courts
    should be reluctant to unnecessarily expand the reach of s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em>,
    thereby introducing an impediment to s.&nbsp;259(4) prosecutions based on
    provincial driving disqualifications.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interpretation of ss. 259(5) and 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> urged by my
    colleague would constrain the states ability to prosecute driving while
    disqualified charges by imposing the procedural requirements of s. 260(1) in
    all cases where a driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em> was
    imposed, at any time, on the relevant offender.  I am not persuaded that the
    resulting curtailment of prosecutorial flexibility accords with Parliaments
    intention, or the public interest. </p>
  <p class=Heading>VII.    Conclusion and Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons
    given, I conclude that an offender may be convicted of driving while
    disqualified under s. 259(4) of the <em>Code</em> based on either or both a
    driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em>, or a driving suspension or
    restriction imposed under provincial law upon conviction for an eligible <em>Code</em> driving offence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the Crown
    relies on a driving prohibition order under the <em>Code</em> as the relevant
    driving disqualification, as permitted by s. 259(5)(a) of the <em>Code</em>, <em>Molina</em> requires that the Crown prove compliance with s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> as
    an essential element of the s. 259(4) offence.  However, where the Crown relies
    on a provincial driving suspension or restriction, as contemplated by
    s.&nbsp;259(5)(b)(i) of the <em>Code</em>, s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> is
    not engaged.  In the latter circumstances, on the authority of ss. 260(4) and
    (5) of the <em>Code</em>, the Crown may prove the provincial driving
    disqualification by relying on a provincial registrars certificate setting out
    the details of the provincial driving suspension or restriction, without regard
    to compliance with s. 260(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case,
    the Crown relied exclusively on the provincial suspension of the appellants
    drivers license to prove its case.  The receipt of notice and the validity of
    the license suspension were admitted by the appellant.  As a result, proof of
    compliance with s. 260(1) of the <em>Code</em> was not required and the
    appellant was properly convicted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appellants conviction
    appeal.</p>
