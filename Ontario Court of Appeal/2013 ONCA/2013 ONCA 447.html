    Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Laskin J.A.:</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aaron Aird appeals his conviction on two counts of sexual exploitation
    of the complainant S.L. and his sentence of one year imprisonment.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the complainant met in the fall of 2008.  He was 28
    and in his second year of teachers college.  She was nearly 17 and in grade
    12.  The complainants mother hired the appellant to tutor the complainant in
    math.  Tutoring sessions took place twice a week.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the appellant and the complainant started a sexual
    relationship.  It began with sexual touching and progressed to oral sex and
    then sexual intercourse.  The appellant stopped tutoring the complainant in
    February 2009, but their sexual relationship continued until March 2010, when a
    close friend persuaded the complainant to go to the police.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two main issues at trial.  The first issue was whether the
    appellant and the complainant had a sexual relationship before the complainant
    turned 18.  The appellant testified that the sexual relationship began after
    tutoring ended and after the complainant turned 18.  The complainant testified
    that their sexual relationship began while the appellant tutored her and before
    she turned 18.  The trial judge rejected the appellants evidence and accepted
    the complainants evidence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue was whether the appellant was in a position of trust
    towards the complainant.  The trial judge found that he was.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On his conviction appeal, the appellant makes two submissions: the trial
    judge erred in finding that the appellant was in a position of trust towards
    the complainant because he equated the appellants position with that of a
    teacher; and the trial judge erred by scrutinizing the appellants evidence
    more strictly than that of the complainant.  On his sentence appeal, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by drawing very little if any
    distinction between the appellants position and that of a teacher.  </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>background</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tutoring relationship</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainants birthday is November 25, 1991.  As I said in the
    overview, in the fall of 2008, she was nearly 17 and was in grade 12.  She was
    a good student, getting marks in the 80s but wanted to do better, as she
    intended to apply to university.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the fall of 2008, the appellant was placed as a student-teacher at an
    elementary school in Waterloo.  He was assigned to a grade 8 class, and one of
    his students was the complainants younger sister, J.L..  J.L. brought home a
    flyer about the appellant, which said that he had a university degree in
    mathematics.  The complainants mother, K.L., approached the appellant and
    asked him if he gave private lessons.  He said that he did, and they exchanged
    telephone numbers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K.L. arranged for the appellant to meet the complainant twice weekly to
    help her with advanced functions.  She agreed to pay him $50 per week for the
    two sessions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant described the tutoring sessions.  They began either in late
    September or early October.  The first session was at Wilfred Laurier
    University; the other sessions were at a coffee pub, as it offered free
    internet access.  The sessions took place on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:00
    p.m. and were scheduled for an hour, though they sometimes went longer.  During
    the sessions, the complainant worked through her homework problems.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that the tutoring sessions were helpful and increased her
    confidence on tests.  She said that the appellant explained things well, was
    not intimidating, and tried to keep her ahead of the class.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and the complainant gave different evidence of when the tutoring
    sessions ended.  The appellant said that they ended in the first week of
    December 2008, as the complainant no longer needed his help.  The complainant
    said the sessions ended in February 2009.  She finished the course in advanced
    functions at the end of January.  She then began a course in data management,
    but it was easier and she did not need the appellants help with it.  </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sexual relationship</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant and the appellant gave different accounts of when their sexual
    relationship began.  As I have said, the trial judge accepted the complainants
    account.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainants version</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant said that their sexual relationship began in late November or early
    December 2008.    On one occasion, while waiting in the appellants truck for her
    mother to pick her up, the appellant kissed her on the lips and she kissed him
    back.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that the first time they had oral sex was over the
    Christmas holidays of 2008.  After one of their tutoring sessions ended, they
    started kissing and the appellant wanted to go further.  They went to a
    parking lot where the appellant introduced oral sex, which she then performed
    on him.  Afterwards, he drove her to her car and she went home.  On another
    occasion over the holidays, the complainant saw the appellant at a Starbucks
    coffee shop.  They kissed and touched each other and then went for a drive.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Their
    sexual relationship continued in January 2009.  Early that month, the appellant
    invited the complainant over to his apartment.  While giving her a tour of his
    place, he pulled her onto his bed and they had oral sex.  The complainant
    testified that by late January 2009. they began to have sexual intercourse. 
    Their sexual relations took place at the appellants apartment at times other
    than their tutoring sessions.  The complainant said that she agreed to have
    sexual intercourse with the appellant because she thought they were in a
    boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.  On Valentines Day 2009, she went to his
    apartment and gave him a bracelet with his name engraved on it.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the complainants tutoring sessions ended in February 2009, her sexual
    relationship with the appellant continued until March 2010.  She testified that
    their relationship did not consist of anything other than going to his
    apartment for sex.  She complained about this.  But he said that they could not
    do other things together because their relationship was wrong.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants version</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    August 2009, the appellant was certified as teacher.  He obtained a long-term
    occasional contract position teaching math at a high school in Elmira.  He had
    a girlfriend but was on and off with her in the fall of 2009.  He would get in
    touch with the complainant during the off periods. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant turned 18 in late November 2009.  The appellant testified that in
    December, he had a complete falling out with his girlfriend.  He said that he
    then began a sexual relationship with the complainant, which lasted until March
    2010, when she went to the police.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant admitted that his sexual relationship with the complainant included
    sexual intercourse, oral sex, mutual masturbation, and kissing and that it all
    took place at his apartment.</p>

    upset that the appellant was not giving her definitive answers about his
    ex-girlfriend and particularly whether they had rekindled their relationship. 
    She pestered him for answers, and he continued to ask for sex.  She testified
    that she decided to go to the police because she and the appellant were arguing
    a lot and because he began to make inappropriate sexual comments, including
    suggesting a threesome.</p>

lang=EN>In finding that the appellant stood in a position of trust towards the
    complainant, the trial judge applied the principles in </span><em>Audet</em><span
lang=EN>.  The crux of his finding is at pp. 35-36 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Aird was hired by K.L. to be S.L.s tutor because
    he was a student teacher and because he had a university degree in
    mathematics.  Certainly K.L. relied on Airds position in the teaching
    community and his integrity when she hired him to tutor her daughter.  Aird was
    a professional tutor in the sense that he had the credentials and was paid for
    his work.  The fact that Aird was a tutor was his introduction to S.L.  Airds
    university degree in mathematics, the fact that he was a student teacher and 28
    years of age gave Aird significant status in relation to S.L. who, in October,
    2008, was a 16-year-old high school student.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The nature of the tutor/student relationship
    between Aird and S.L. created an opportunity for Aird, 11 and ½ years S.L.s
    senior, to use his status and the persuasive and influencing factors he held in
    their relationship to effectively groom her into a sexual relationship.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>That finding is a finding of fact.  It is, therefore, entitled to the
    usual appellate deference unless the appellant can show that it rests on an
    error of law or principle.  Mr. Humphrey submits that the trial judge erred in
    principle because he elevated the appellants status as a tutor to that of a
    teacher.  He points to several characteristics of the relationship between the
    appellant and the complainant that distinguishes it from a teacher/student
    relationship.  For example: </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>I do not accept this submission for two reasons.  First, the trial
    judge did not equate the appellants status as a tutor with that of a teacher
    and therefore, presume a position of trust.  Rather, he took into account the
    appellants position at the school and his training as a teacher because they
    were key considerations in assessing whether the appellant stood in a position
    of trust.  The appellants position as a student teacher and his expertise in
    mathematics undoubtedly informed the complainants and, perhaps more importantly,
    K.L.s expectations about the relationship.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Second, although the relationship between the appellant and the complainant
    differed from the traditional teacher/student relationship in a school, that
    difference does not undermine the trial judges finding of a relationship of
    trust.  The vast majority of teachers stand not only in a position of trust
    towards their students, they also stand in a position of authority towards
    them.  Some of the distinguishing characteristics Mr. Humphrey relies on  for example,
    authority over grades and ability to discipline  reflect only a position of
    authority.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Positions of trust and authority are related concepts.  But they are
    different concepts and provide separate routes to the offence of sexual
    exploitation.  An accused not in a position of authority towards a young person
    may nonetheless be found to be in a position of trust.  Blair J. made this
    point in </span><em>P.S.</em><span lang=EN>, at para. 37:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>I take a position of trust to be somewhat
    different than a position of authority.  The latter invokes notions of power
    and the ability to hold in ones hands the future or destiny of the person who
    is the object of the exercise of the authority: see, R. v. Kyle (1991), 68
    C.C.C. (3d) 286 (Ont. C.A.).  A position of trust may, but need not
    necessarily, incorporate those characteristics.  It is founded on notions of
    safety and confidence and reliability that the special nature of the
    relationship will not be breached.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The Crown did not argue that the appellant was in a position of
    authority towards the complainant, only that he was in a position of trust. 
    And, as Ms. Roberts noted in her factum, in some important ways, the
    complainant and her family trusted or relied on the appellant more than they
    would have were he her teacher at school.  In particular:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

lang=EN>According to the trial judge, when the complainant met the appellant,
    she was naïve, easy to lead on, and had no sexual experience.  She, along
    with her mother, looked to the appellant for his help and guidance.  She was
    entitled to trust that he would not take advantage of his position and use it
    to start a sexual relationship with her.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Mr. Humphrey submits that the trial judge erred by applying different
    standards in assessing the evidence of the appellant and the complainant. 
    Specifically, he contends that the trial judge scrutinized the appellants
    evidence more strictly than that of the complainant.  His contention has two
    parts to it:  the trial judge was unforgiving in his criticism of the
    appellants evidence; and he was not critical at all of various aspects of the
    complainants evidence that warranted scrutiny.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The different standards of scrutiny argument is a difficult argument
    to succeed on in an appellate court.  It is difficult for two related reasons:
    credibility findings are the province of the trial judge and attract a very
    high degree of deference on appeal; and appellate courts invariably view this
    argument with skepticism, seeing it as a veiled invitation to reassess the
    trial judges credibility determinations.  Thus, as Doherty J.A. said in </span><em>R.
    v. J.H.</em> <span lang=EN>(2005), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 480 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
    59: [t]o succeed in this kind of argument, the appellant must point to
    something in the reasons of the trial judge or perhaps elsewhere in the record that
    make it clear that the trial judge had applied different standards in assessing

    rejection of his explanation why he could not remember certain details, at p.
    33:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>When Aird allegedly had difficulty remembering
    things, he tried to blame his memory problems on a motor vehicle accident which
    took place approximately 12 years ago.  I find this extremely unlikely since
    hes been able to obtain two university degrees since the motor vehicle
    accident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>When viewed in context, I do not think this example assists the
    appellants different standards of scrutiny argument.  In his evidence-in-chief,
    the appellant did not mention that his car accident 12 years earlier had
    affected his memory.  In cross-examination, the Crown questioned the
    appellants evidence that he scheduled twice weekly physiotherapy appointments
    to begin across town at the same time as his tutoring sessions with the
    complainant ended.  During this questioning, the Crown asked for the name of
    the appellants physiotherapist.  Although the appellant apparently had been
    going to the physiotherapy twice a week for 16 months, he claimed not to recall
    the names of his therapists.  The Crown asked: [d]o you have an issue with
    your memory?  The appellant answered: I dont know.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Later in his cross-examination, the Crown returned to the theme of the

    place:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Q.      Okay.

lang=EN>This was the only evidence that the appellant had a memory problem. 
    The trial judge was entitled to reject his attempt to blame his memory on a car
    accident many years earlier, when in the years following, the appellant
    obtained a university degree in mathematics, completed teachers college, and
    became a skilled tutor.  Indeed, the appellant had no difficulty directly

    judges assessment of the appellants credibility.  The appellant did not
    testify that he had trouble remembering what happened in his relationship with
    the complainant.  Instead, he gave a different account, and much of that
    account made little sense.  </span></p>

    sessions back to back with his physiotherapy appointments, with no allowance

    complainant in December 2008, as he claimed, when her examination did not take
    place until the end of January 2009.  And it made little sense that the
    complainant would give the appellant an engraved bracelet on Valentines Day
    if, as he claimed, he stopped tutoring her months earlier, he had virtually no
    contact with her since then, and he had not yet begun an intimate relationship
    with her.  </span></p>

    time, that she was uncomfortable with her relationship with the appellant
    because he was a tutor and she saw him as a professional.  The defence
    contended that the complainant tailored her evidence at trial to accord with
    the key issue in the case: whether the appellant was in a position of trust
    towards her.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    evidence that tutoring ended in February 2009 and K.L.s evidence that she
    continued to give the complainant cash to pay the appellant for tutoring until
    March or April.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The trial judge, however, addressed and scrutinized each of these
    aspects of the complainants evidence.  In particular:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge noted that before discussing the
    case with the Crown, the complainant did not complain about the tutor/student
    relationship.  But the trial judge also noted that the complainant saw the
    appellant as her sisters teacher and that he felt like a teacher to her.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge recognized that when the
    complainant spoke to the police she was angry with the way the appellant had
    treated her.  However, it was not the complainant, but her girlfriend, who
    initially went to the police.  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>During the Crowns submissions, the trial judge
    directly asked about the inconsistency between the complainants evidence and K.L.s
    evidence as to when tutoring ended.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The trial judge noted the inconsistency in the
    complainants evidence about whether she was shocked when the appellant kissed
    her.  However, the trial judge concluded that it made sense that a young
    17-year-old girl would think it was weird that a man, more than 11 years her
    senior and her tutor, would hold her hand after a tutoring session and on
    another occasion kiss her on the mouth.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>It therefore seems to me that the appellants different standard of
    scrutiny argument cannot prevail.  The trial judge did scrutinize the
    complainants evidence appropriately.  He took into account the defence
    concerns about her testimony.  However, he found the complainants evidence to
    be candid and highly believable.  That was his call to make.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>At trial, the Crown asked that the appellant be sentenced to 12 to 18 months
    imprisonment.  The appellant asked for a sentence of between 45 days, which was
    the mandatory minimum at the time, and six months.  The trial judge imposed a
    sentence of one year imprisonment plus one year probation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The appellant submits that his prison term ought to be reduced.  He
    contends that the trial judge overstated the gravity of his offence by
    effectively treating his tutoring relationship with the complainant as
    equivalent to a teacher/student relationship.  In support of his contention, he
    points to the following passage from the trial judges reasons on sentence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The court draws very little if any distinction
    between the position of trust of a teacher and a tutor under the circumstances
    of this case.  As set out in the reasons for judgment, it was that position of
    trust that allowed Mr. Aird entre to the victim and gave him the continuing
    ability to groom her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>I do not agree with the appellants contention.  The trial judge knew
    that the appellant was not the complainants actual teacher.  And he did not
    sentence the appellant as if he were her teacher.  Later in his sentencing
    reasons, he noted that the cases the Crown relied on to support a sentence in
    the range of 15 to 18 months were all cases in which the accused was the
    victims teacher.  See for example, </span><em>R. v. Gaukrodger</em><span
lang=EN> (2006), 215 O.A.C. 74 (C.A.).  By sentencing the appellant to 12
    months, the trial judge rejected the range of sentence for teachers, who,
    unlike the appellant, stand in a position of authority as well as trust towards
    a young person.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In the passage the appellant relies on, the trial judge was merely
    expressing his opinion that under the circumstances of this case the
    seriousness of the appellants breach of trust was similar to the seriousness
    of a teachers breach of trust.  I agree with the trial judges assessment.  As
    I said earlier in these reasons, in some respects the complainant and her
    family placed more trust on the appellant than they would have placed on the
    complainants teacher.  That they did so elevates the seriousness of the
    appellants breach.  Therefore, the trial judge did not err in the way the
    appellant alleges that he did. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>That leaves the issue whether the trial judge was justified in imposing
    a one year term of imprisonment.  The appellant can claim several mitigating
    considerations:</span></p>
