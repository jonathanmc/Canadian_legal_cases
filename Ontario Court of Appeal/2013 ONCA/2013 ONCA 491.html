  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Johanne N. Morissette

    the order of Justice Peter R. W. Isaacs of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated
    September 2, 2010.</p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b>Feldman and Simmons JJ.A.:</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L.H. was born in June 2007. In March 2008, an order was made under the <em>Child
    and Family Services Act,</em> R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (the “CFSA”) designating her
    a Crown ward with no access. In February 2009, L.H.’s mother brought a status
    review application, seeking an order that L.H. be returned to her care, subject
    to supervision by the <span style='line-height:200%'>Children’s Aid Society of
    Oxford County (the “Society”). The trial of the status review application
    commenced in November 2009 and was completed in February 2010. </span>On September
    2, 2010, the status review application was dismissed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother’s first level appeal from the dismissal of the status review
    application was dismissed by a Superior Court judge on July 20, 2012. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this court, the mother raises several issues relating to
    both the decision of the Superior Court appeal judge and the decision of the status
    review judge. In our view, the central issue to be determined is the impact of
    the fresh evidence applications filed by the mother and the Society.</p>
  <h1 style='line-height:250%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> L.H. was apprehended by the Society shortly after her birth in June
    2007, before she left the hospital. She has four siblings: three older sisters,
    D.S. (born in December 1995), T.C. (born in September 2000) and T.C. (born in
    October 2002<em>)</em>, and a younger brother, W.H. (born in October 2008). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L.H. and her sister, D.S., were made Crown wards with no access on March
    14, 2008; similar orders were made in relation to T.C. and T.C. on April 7,
    2008. The mother’s issues at the time of the Crown wardship orders included a
    transient lifestyle, exposure to domestic violence and drug use. Nonetheless,
    during the time these children were in foster care, their mother continued to
    have access to them until December 2007.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like L.H., her younger brother, W.H., was apprehended soon after his
    birth and before he left the hospital. W.H. was made a Crown ward, with
    specified access, on December 22, 2008. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the mother was pregnant with W.H., she began taking steps to try
    to turn her life around. In February 2009, she initiated status review
    applications in relation to all of her children who had been made Crown wards. The
    proceedings relating to T.C. and T.C. were dismissed in June 2009 because the
    two girls were adopted in January 2009, before the status review applications
    were commenced.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time of the trial of the status review proceeding for L.H., which
    began in November 2009, the mother had a job at Wendy’s and an apartment. She
    had been drug free for over a year and was continuing to pursue drug
    rehabilitation programs. Her progress was such that the Society was prepared to
    return her oldest child, D.S., and her youngest child, W.H., to her care,
    subject to supervision orders. At the trial of the status review application,
    the foster mother of W.H. attested to the mother’s bond with W.H. and to the
    appropriateness of the mother’s parenting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite its position concerning D.S. and W.H., on the status review
    application, the Society took the position that L.H. had special needs and that
    it was not in her best interests that she be returned to her mother’s care. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    adduced at the hearing indicated that L.H. was born five weeks premature, that
    she was exposed to cocaine while in the womb and that she developed feeding
    problems while in care, necessitating first the use of an “NG” tube in her nose
    and later the insertion of a “G” tube into her stomach to ensure that she
    received sufficient nutrition. The evidence also indicated that L.H. was
    developmentally delayed and required the services of several professionals,
    including a speech therapist, occupational therapist and nutritionist. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the Society led evidence at the hearing indicating that, in her first
    foster home, L.H. went through an initial period – about three months – of
    extreme irritability, screaming and crying for hours. The foster mother also
    testified L.H. was a wilful child, given to tantrums.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the
    time of the status review hearing, L.H. had been placed with a potential
    adoptive family – a mother, a father and three boys – for several months, since
    June 2009. L.H.’s foster mother testified that she helped train the potential
    adoptive parents in the use of the G tube and that feeding using the G tube
    could take up to an hour or more. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the foster mother, by the time of the status review hearing L.H. was feeding
    orally much of the time. However, she still had choking episodes and was
    fearful about eating. On some days, she needed supplementary nourishment
    through the G tube with a pump. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L.H.’s
    adoption worker testified that L.H.’s needs were such that her potential
    adoptive mother initially left her employment to be at home full time to care
    for her. During cross-examination, the worker indicated it had taken six months
    for the relationship between L.H. and her potential adoptive mother to develop.
    She also expressed the opinion that it would be damaging for L.H. to go through
    the placement process again.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    concluded in early January 2010 and written submissions were filed on February 26,
    2010. </p>
  <h1 style='line-height:250%'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE status review JUDGMENT</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reasons
    released on September 2, 2010, the status review judge dismissed the status
    review application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on
    the submissions of the parties, he approached the issue before him as being
    whether the mother’s changed circumstances constituted “a material change in
    circumstances … so as to justify the remedy sought.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The status
    review judge concluded that a change in the disposition of Crown wardship was
    not justified taking account of several factors:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>because L.H. was born premature and medically fragile, it had
    been necessary to place her with experienced foster parents;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>L.H.’s first foster mother had provided compelling evidence that
    parenting L.H. required a significant commitment, both because of her medical
    needs and her temperament;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although the mother’s drug use had significantly improved, it
    remained possible she could relapse;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the mother had not demonstrated a real understanding of the
    commitment and effort that would be required to successfully parent L.H.;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the mother had not provided specifics concerning how she would
    acquire the knowledge and experience to feed L.H.; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>L.H.’s best interests required that she be “placed in a safe,
    stable, secure home with parents who are capable of providing the time and expertise
    that is necessary in order to prepare [L.H.] for long term development.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the status review judge concluded that “[n]othing ha[d] been produced to
    demonstrate that access to [L.H.] by [the mother] will be either beneficial or
    meaningful for the child.”</p>
  <h1 style='line-height:250%'>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE SUPERIOR COURT APPEAL JUDGMENT</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July
    20, 2012, a Superior Court appeal judge dismissed the mother’s appeal from the
    status review order, holding that the mother had failed to demonstrate any
    palpable and overriding error in the status review judge’s reasons. The
    Superior Court appeal judge made no comment on the mother’s fresh evidence
    application.</p>
  <h1 style='line-height:250%'>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ISSUES RAISED ON APPEAL</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal
    to this court, the mother argues that the Superior Court appeal judge erred in
    declining to admit her fresh evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the
    mother submits that the status review judge failed to apply the correct test on
    a status review application and that he failed to appreciate that the evidence
    led by the Society did not support a finding that L.H. continued to be in need
    of protection. In the alternative, the mother contends that the status review

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As an
    additional ground of appeal, the mother submits that neither the Superior Court
    appeal judge nor the status review judge gave adequate reasons for their
    decisions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, after
    this appeal was perfected, the mother delivered a notice of constitutional
    question, giving notice of her intention to seek a remedy under s. 24(1) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. In that regard, the mother
    claims that delays in dealing with this matter have infringed her right to
    security of the person under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the
    mother and the Society have applied to introduce fresh evidence on appeal.
    However, the Society contends that such evidence is relevant only if this court
    determines there has been an error in the courts below.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ANALYSIS</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have
    said, in our view, the central issue to be determined on this appeal is the
    impact of the fresh evidence applications filed by the parties. Before turning
    to that issue, we will briefly explain why we would not give effect to the
    other grounds of appeal raised by the mother. We will deal with the mother’s
    notice of constitutional question and the issue of delay as a separate matter.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:250%'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Preliminary Issues</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    this is an appeal from the Superior Court appeal judge, the mother’s grounds of
    appeal focus primarily on the status review judge’s reasons. In the
    circumstances, we take the mother to be asserting that the Superior Court
    appeal judge erred by failing to identify a material error in the status review
    judge’s reasons: see <em>Children’s Aid Society of Toronto v. G.S.</em>, 2012
    ONCA 783, 299 O.A.C. 24, at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother
    and the Society both submit that the test to be applied on a status review
    application is set out in <em>Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan
    Toronto v. C.M.</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165, at p. 200</span>:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does the child continue to be in need of protection?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Which of the available range of orders is in the child’s best interests?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said,
    the mother and the Society disagree on the precise meaning of the test
    articulated in <em>C.M.</em>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the
    mother’s interpretation, the first step of the test requires the status review
    judge to determine whether the child continues to be in need of protection as
    that term is defined in s. 37(2) of the CFSA.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> According to the mother, the Society could not meet that test on the status
    review application based on the evidence adduced at the review hearing for two
    reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the
    mother had addressed the protection concerns raised by the Society in its
    initial application – a fact that was demonstrated by the Society’s agreement
    that two of the mother’s children be returned to her. Second, according to the
    mother, the Society failed to adduce evidence on the status review application
    of L.H.’s needs, or other aspects of her situation after the Crown wardship
    order that could demonstrate new protection concerns. In these circumstances,
    no finding that L.H. continued to be in need of protection was available and it
    was necessary that L.H. be returned to her mother.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not
    accept the mother’s interpretation of <em>C.M.</em>, namely, that the first
    step of the test requires the status review judge to determine whether the
    child continues to be in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 37(2)
    of the CFSA. At p. 200 of its decision in <em>C.M.</em>, the Supreme Court of
    Canada made it clear that, in addition to the factors enumerated in s. 37(2) of
    the CFSA, a finding of a continuing need for protection could also be premised
    on the need to protect a child from emotional harm arising from removing the
    child from caregivers to whom the child had become attached and whom the child
    regarded as psychological parents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the status review judge did not specifically address the issue in this way,
    taking account of his view of the mother’s evidence, we are satisfied that if
    he had considered the full <em>C.M.</em> test, he would have come to the
    conclusion that a continuing need for protection existed and that it was in
    L.H.’s best interests to maintain the order for Crown wardship with no access. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the mother’s submissions, the Society led evidence at the status review
    hearing relating to L.H.’s circumstances following the Crown wardship order.
    That evidence consisted, in part, of the evidence of L.H.’s first foster mother
    concerning her experience with L.H. as a child living in her home as well as
    her experiences in assisting the proposed adoptive parents in learning to feed
    L.H. In addition, the evidence included the testimony of an adoption worker who
    spent time with the proposed adoptive parents, visited with them as recently as
    November 2009, and opined, when asked to do so by the mother’s hearing counsel,
    that it would be damaging for L.H. to go through the placement process again.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    clear that the status review judge considered this evidence in arriving at his
    decision. He referred to the need to place L.H. in a stable environment that
    could ensure her long-term development. This evidence demonstrated that L.H.
    still had significant needs relating to feeding and arising from her
    developmental delay, that she had experienced difficulties in settling into new
    environments, that she had formed an attachment with her proposed adoptive
    parents, and that, despite her initial difficulties, she appeared to be making
    progress in her proposed adoptive parents’ home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When this
    evidence is combined with the status review judge’s findings about the
    challenges that the mother would face in coping with L.H.’s needs and the needs
    of her two other children, as well as the evidence establishing that the mother
    had not seen L.H. since December 2007, we are satisfied that, in making his
    disposition, the status review judge believed that there would be a significant
    risk of harm to L.H. if she were removed from the potential adoptive parents’
    home and that her best interests, as defined in s. 37(3) of the CFSA and as
    more broadly described in <em>C.M.</em>, would be served by making an order
    that would facilitate her adoption – Crown wardship with no access. In our
    view, this conclusion is supported by the evidence at the hearing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    counsel made submissions to us about the amendments made to the provisions of
    the CFSA generally and relating to status review applications that came into
    force in 2000; nor did they make submissions about the case law from lower
    courts and commentary suggesting that those amendments may have resulted in a
    shift from the two-step <em>C.M.</em> test to a pure best interests test.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> In these circumstances, we consider it unnecessary to address the effect, if
    any, of the 2000 amendments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light
    of our conclusion concerning the status review judge’s application of the test
    on a status review application, it is unnecessary to address the ground of
    appeal relating to the adequacy of his reasons. The Superior Court appeal judge’s
    reasons were responsive to the submissions that were made to her, which did not
    include submissions about the test on a status review application. Although we
    agree that the Superior Court appeal judge should have addressed the mother’s
    fresh evidence application, the fresh evidence that was tendered is not before
    us. Accordingly, we are not in a position to comment on whether that failure
    gave rise to reversible error.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The mother’s fresh evidence is in the form of her own sworn
    affidavit. The mother explains that while she could not get medical training
    relating to L.H.’s specific needs, she did take other medical courses to better
    prepare herself to provide for L.H.’s care. She also explains that she graduated
    from a medical lab assistant/technician course that included some
    health-related components. The mother states that her career has improved
    dramatically since the original hearing, that she now has a part-time managerial
    position at a restaurant, and that she owns a home with a new partner that has
    space to accommodate L.H. The mother also deposes that D.S. and W.H. have been
    living with her and are thriving.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The Society, for its part, submits an affidavit from the private
    adoption practitioner who supervised the placement of the child with her
    prospective adoptive parents. The affidavit confirms that L.H. no longer
    requires a feeding tube, that the abdominal opening for the feeding tube was
    surgically repaired in January 2013, and that L.H. is in good general health.&nbsp;Without
    any specific supporting information, the practitioner states that the child
    “has become very secure and appears to be well attached to her prospective adoptive
    family.”&nbsp;It is also noted that the proposed adoptive parents, who also
    have three boys, have separated since the time of the adoption home study but
    that they “cooperate and focus on the needs of the children when arranging
    their time.” The affidavit confirms that the prospective adoptive family “do[es]
    not feel comfortable with any openness in an adoption” and that L.H. has not
    seen her older sister D.S. since the placement. The affidavit also includes a
    hearsay statement from the adoptive mother speaking to the child’s current

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In </span><em>C.M.</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    at pp. 188-89, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that a flexible standard
    should be adopted for the admission of fresh evidence in family law cases
    involving children, in circumstances where accurate and up-to-date information
    concerning the best interests of children, when considered with the evidence adduced
    at trial, might reasonably affect the outcome of the appeal. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>(1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 174 (C.A.), this court noted, that having
    regard to the flexible standard, the admission of fresh evidence will not lead
    inexorably to reversal of the trial judgment or ordering a new trial. Rather,
    the fresh evidence, if admitted, “must be reviewed with the other evidence in
    determining what the appropriate disposition of the appeal should be”: at p.
    193.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>In our view, this is just such a case requiring the admission of
    fresh evidence to determine the proper disposition of the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The evidence submitted by the Society indicates that the proposed
    adoptive parents have now separated. The status review judge’s reasons make it
    clear that the stable two-parent home provided by the proposed adoptive parents
    was a key factor in his decision to uphold the order for Crown wardship with no
    access. If stability – and harmony – and two supportive parents – are no longer
    features of the proposed adoptive home, those are factors that could impact the
    outcome of the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>In our view, in its role as the statutory protector of L.H.’s best
    interests, it was incumbent on the Society to seek to introduce fresh evidence
    relating to the separation of the proposed adoptive parents and the impact of
    the separation on L.H., so that this court can satisfy itself that the order
    under review remains in the child’s best interests.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>On our review, the Society’s evidence is not adequate to permit us
    to do so. Although the adoption practitioner states that the proposed adoptive
    parents remain co-operative and child-focused, her evidence in that respect is
    supported by little in the way of facts capable of permitting us to assess the
    accuracy of her statements. She did not disclose the particulars of the
    financial arrangements between the parties concerning the children in the
    mother’s care, nor did she indicate how the financial or access arrangements
    have been formalized. Equally important, the adoption practitioner’s evidence
    does not provide us with facts to permit us to assess the impact of the
    proposed adoptive parents’ separation on L.H.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the
    circumstances, we consider this an appropriate case for the Society to provide
    an assessment of the proposed adoptive parents and L.H. to address: the impact
    of the separation on the ability of the proposed adoptive parents to parent
    L.H., the impact of the separation on L.H., and whether access with her birth
    mother and her siblings in her birth mother’s care would be in L.H.’s best
    interests. The assessment should be in the form contemplated by s. 54 of the
    CFSA. The parties shall have ten days following the release of these reasons to
    select an assessor and submit the name of the assessor to the court. The
    assessor shall submit an assessment report to this court within 30 days of the

  <h2 style='line-height:250%'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constitutional Remedy</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    bringing the appeal to this court, the mother served a Notice of Constitutional
    Question on the Attorney General of Ontario and on the Attorney General of
    Canada, stating that her s. 7 <em>Charter</em> rights were infringed by the
    institutional delay in the progress of this case, which caused L.H. to remain
    in the care of the prospective adoptive parents from June 2009 to the present
    with no access to the mother. This delay effectively created a situation where
    L.H. has lived with the prospective adoptive family for four years and
    therefore had the exclusive opportunity to bond with them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her
    factum, the mother asked for a declaration that her <em>Charter</em> rights had
    been breached. In oral argument, on the issue of remedy, counsel confirmed that
    the mother was asking for the same relief that she was already seeking on the
    appeal, or a monetary award, although he noted that the mother is not really
    seeking such an award. She is seeking custody of or access to her daughter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No one on
    behalf of either Attorney General appeared nor did anyone seek to take part in
    this appeal. We also note that the Notice of Constitutional Question that was
    served did not seek any remedy from the Attorneys General.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The basis
    of the mother’s s. 7 claim is the institutional delay that occurred in this
    case. The chronology began in March 2008 when the order for Crown wardship with
    no access was made for L.H. The mother applied for a status review under s.
    65.1 of the CFSA on February 20, 2009, returnable on April 6, 2009. Although
    Rule 33 of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, O. Reg. 114/99 provides that a status
    review hearing must be completed within 120 days, for reasons unexplained in
    the record, the status review hearing in this case did not begin until November
    16, 2009. In the meantime, in June 2009, L.H. was placed with the prospective
    adoptive family with whom she continues to reside today. The hearing was continued
    on January 5, 2010 with written submissions on February 26, 2010. The reasons
    of the status review judge were released on September 2, 2010.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the
    purposes of the appeal to the Superior Court, the mother ordered the transcript
    of the hearing on January 29, 2011, but it was not prepared for 13 months until
    March 7, 2012. The appeal record to the Superior Court was filed on April 23,
    2012. The Superior Court appeal judge released her reasons on July 20, 2012. Because
    her reasons were given orally, the transcript of those reasons had to be
    ordered for the purpose of the appeal to this court. The transcript was not
    produced until December 17, 2012. The mother was also not able to perfect her
    appeal to this court without orders of the two lower courts, which could only
    be obtained with the Society’s cooperation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the mother submits that her rights under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> have been violated by delays she did not cause. Although she initiated the
    status review in February 2009, the decision of the court only came in
    September 2010. Her appeal was then delayed for 13 months because the
    transcript of the hearing, which was required, took that long to prepare. There
    was then an additional delay in bringing the further appeal to this court
    because the oral reasons of the appeal judge, which were very brief – just two
    pages (plus 17 pages of submissions) – were not prepared for several months.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is evident
    that expedition of the proceedings is particularly important in child welfare
    cases, where the lives of a child, her family and in some cases such as this
    one, a potential adoptive family, are put on hold awaiting the outcome.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the Society suggested in oral argument that the onus was on the mother to
    move before the court for orders expediting the transcripts. We disagree. As
    custodian of the process, it is incumbent on the Society to use its best
    efforts to ensure that the process moves expeditiously, in the best interests
    of the child. In that role, it is the Society that should be alerting the court
    to any delays that may be occurring and asking the court to make the necessary
    orders to remedy those delays.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, institutional delays, such as in transcript preparation, are not the
    fault of either party to the process. The mother argues that the delays in this
    case have affected the fairness of the review process and have thus violated
    her s. 7 <em>Charter</em> rights.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    clear that in child welfare matters, where the fate of a child is determined
    through the CFSA protection process, including appeals, hearing dates must be
    timely and transcripts must generally be produced on a priority basis. Where
    that does not occur, the rights of the child and of her family can be affected.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    whether any of these delays can amount to a <em>Charter</em> breach, whether
    they do in this case, and if so, who is responsible for them and whether there
    is an appropriate remedy that does not affect the court’s disposition regarding
    the child, are questions where the court would benefit from submissions on behalf
    of the Attorney General of Ontario.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    reasons shall be provided to the Attorney General of Ontario by the Registrar.
    The court requests the Attorney General to provide written submissions to
    assist the court within 30 days. If the Attorney General would like to make
    oral submissions, arrangements will be made as well.</p>
