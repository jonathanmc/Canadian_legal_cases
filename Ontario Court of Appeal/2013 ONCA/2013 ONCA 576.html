  <p class=Heard>Heard: June 11, 2013</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Helen A. Rady of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated October 18, 2012, with reasons reported at
    2012 ONSC 5412, 113 O.R. (3d) 67.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>By the Court:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This appeal involves a dispute
    over the interpretation of various oil and gas agreements and whether they
    confer a right to inject and store gas into and under certain lands now owned
    by McKinley Farms Limited (the “McKinley Lands”). Both the appellant, Tribute
    Resources Inc. (“Tribute”), and the respondent, 2195002 Ontario Inc. (“219
    Ontario”), claim the right to inject and store gas into and under the McKinley
    Lands under agreements made with the landowner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge held that
    219 Ontario was entitled to the disputed rights by virtue of a Gas Storage
    Lease made in March 2009 (the “219 Ontario Gas Storage Lease”).  She rejected
    Tribute’s claim to those rights under an Oil and Gas Lease dated October 12,
    1977 (the “1977 Oil and Gas Lease”) as amended by a Unit Operation Agreement
    dated November 30, 1984 (the “1984 Unit Operation Agreement”).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Although the application judge accepted
    that the 1977 Oil and Gas Lease and the 1984 Unit Operation Agreement conveyed
    certain gas storage rights that were in turn subsequently assigned to Tribute,
    she found that those rights were replaced by the terms of a Gas Storage Lease
    entered into by Tribute and </span><span style='line-height:200%'>McKinley
    Farms Limited</span><span style='line-height:200%'> on September 24, 1998 (the
    “1998 </span><span style='line-height:200%'>Tribute Gas Storage Lease</span><span
style='line-height:200%'>”).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Previous litigation that reached this court determined that the 1998
    Tribute Gas Storage Lease terminated in September 2008: see <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Tribute Resources Inc. v. McKinley Farms Ltd.</span></em>, <span style='line-height:200%'>2010 ONCA 392, 263 O.A.C. 214.</span>  The
    application judge concluded that the termination of the 1998 Tribute Gas
    Storage Lease left Tribute without any right to store gas on the McKinley
    Lands. Any of Tribute’s gas storage rights with respect to the land had been
    replaced by the terms of the now terminated 1998 Tribute Gas Storage Lease. The
    219 Ontario Gas Storage Lease was, therefore, the only agreement permitting gas
    storage rights on the McKinley Lands.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On appeal, Tribute argues that the
    1977 Oil and Gas Lease and the 1984 Unit Operation Agreement do contain gas
    storage rights and that those rights continue to exist despite the termination
    of the 1998 </span><span style='line-height:200%'>Tribute Gas Storage Lease</span><span
style='line-height:200%'>.  Tribute’s argument turns primarily on the
    interaction of the relevant provisions of these three documents and, in
    essence, involves an issue of contractual interpretation.  </span></p>

    Ontario submits that the application judge properly interpreted the relevant
    documents. However, 219 Ontario also raises a preliminary argument that this
    court’s jurisdiction to hear this appeal has been ousted because of an order
    made by the Ontario Energy Board (the “OEB”) after the application judge’s
    decision. </span></p>

    that although the application judge had jurisdiction to determine the
    contractual rights of the parties under the various agreements, this court has
    no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the application judge’s decision
    because of an order made by the OEB four months after the application judge’s
    decision in respect of the McKinley Lands.</span></p>

    the McKinley Lands as a gas storage area and a further order under s. 38 of the
    Energy Act authorizing Tribute to inject, store and remove gas from those
    lands. In addition, the OEB stayed the pending compensation application in
    relation to those lands pending conclusion of “all related court proceedings …
    including any appeal of [the application judge’s decision].” Presumably, 219
    Ontario’s contractual rights in the lands, if any, would be relevant to any
    compensation order made by the OEB.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>The parties are agreed that the recent decision of this court

  <p class=CQuote>Section 38(1) provides that the OEB may make a designation
    order authorizing a person to “inject gas into, store gas in and remove gas
    from a designated gas storage area and, and to enter into and upon the land in
    the area and use the land for that purpose” and such an authorized person is
    required under s. 38(2) to make “just and equitable compensation” for the right
    to store gas or for any damage resulting from the authority to do so. <em>The
    substances of the claims in this case do not fall within the language of s.

  <p class=CQuote>The pending application filed by 219 [Ontario], dated September
    1, 2011, requests a judge of the Superior Court to interpret the Tribute Oil
    and Gas Lease and the 219 Ontario Gas Storage Lease. The Board has not
    “designated a gas storage area” or “authorized a person to inject gas into,
    store gas in and remove gas from a designated gas storage area and to enter
    into and upon the land in the area and use the land for that purpose” or made a
    compensation order under s. 36.1, s. 38(1), s. 38(2) or s. 38(3) of the [Energy

  <p class=CQuote>In my view, the substance of the claims made by 219 Ontario in
    its application to the Superior Court for the interpretation of leases does not
    fall within the language of s. 36.1, s. 38(1) or s. 38(2) of the [Energy Act].
    I find that judges of the Superior Court regularly interpret leases and other
    contracts and have the jurisdiction to interpret the contacts at issue and to
    grant the relief sought by 219 Ontario. I further find that the interpretation
    of the leases is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board because the
    Board has not made an order designating the proposed storage areas under s.
    36.1 or 38 of the Act [Energy Act]. [Footnotes omitted.](<em>Tribute v.

    Further, while the 1984 Unit Operation Agreement specifically provided that

  <p class=BContinuingPara>In her view, it was “disingenuous” for Tribute to
    assert that the 1998 Tribute Gas Storage Lease was created to “supplement” the

    Tribute Gas Storage Lease were: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>strong objective evidence that the parties intended the storage

    states that the lands (save and except the surface rights) are leased “for the
    purpose of injecting, storing and withdrawing gas, natural and/or artificial …
    within or from the demised lands”. The terms of the 1998 Tribute Gas Storage
    Lease are detailed and make more specific provision for matters addressed in
    less detail in the earlier agreements. </span></p>

    and Gas Lease as amended by the 1984 Unit Operation Agreement deals primarily

    further agreement to address residual royalties. Clause 12 of the 1984 Unit
    Operation Agreement states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>12. If, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement,
    the Lessee should decide to utilize the underlying productive gas sand as a
    storage reservoir for gas originally produced from other lands, the Lessee
    agrees to notify the Lessor of such utilization, and thenceforth to pay Lessor
    double the herein specified acreage rental amount as full compensation for the
    storage rights herein granted and in lieu of all delay rental in event there is
    a productive well or wells on these lands at the date of said notification the
    Lessee shall not commence utilization of the lands as a storage reservoir

    the Lessor’s royalty.</p>

    Storage Lease provides that the lessee will serve a notice of what it proposes
    to pay for gas storage rights and that if the parties cannot agree, the issue
    will be determined by arbitration. Clauses 16-18 of the 1998 Tribute Gas
    Storage Lease read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>16. Subject to its rights, if any, under the oil and gas lease,
    the Lessee shall not inject gas into the demised lands under the provisions
    hereof until it has offered to the Lessor the additional acreage rental to be
    paid to the Lessor in respect of its storage operations to be conducted
    hereunder in the manner hereinafter provided and until it has offered to
    purchase from the Lessor, as hereinafter provided, the Lessor’s interest in
    such of the gas and oil and related hydrocarbons (hereinafter called “the
    petroleum substances”) contained in the demised lands as are liable on the
    withdrawal of the gas so injected to be co-mingled indistinguishably therewith
    as to their respective volumes, or as are liable to be rendered commercially
    unrecoverable by reason of such injection or the storage operations to be
    conducted by the Lessee hereunder. Nothing herein shall prevent the Lessee from
    and it is hereby given the right at any time and from time to time to purchase
    the Lessor’s interest in any or all the other petroleum substances contained in
    the demised lands.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>17. The purchase price of any of the petroleum substances to be
    purchased by the Lessee under Clause 16 hereof shall be computed as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>18. In the event that the Lessee desires to purchase any of the
    petroleum substances as provided in Clauses 16 and 17 hereof, it shall give
    written notice to the Lessor of the quantity thereof to be purchased, the price
    therefor computed as provided in Clause 17(a) and the effective date of such
    purchase. The Lessee shall in addition state the additional acreage rental to
    be paid by the Lessee in respect of its storage operations to be conducted
    hereunder. The Lessor shall within Thirty (30) days from the receipt of the
    aforesaid notice advise the Lessee that it disputes either the purchase price
    or the additional acreage rental or both of them and in default of such notice
    of dispute the Lessor shall be deemed to have agreed thereto and the same shall
    become final and binding upon the Lessor and the Lessee. In the event that the
    Lessor gives such notice of dispute, such purchase price and additional acreage
    rental and any other compensation payable to the Lessor in respect of the
    Lessee’s storage rights hereunder shall be determined by a board of arbitration
    in the manner provided under the Energy Board Act of Ontario and the
    regulations thereunder or any act or regulations in amendment or substitution
    therefor.</p>

    the termination provision in Schedule B demonstrates that the parties intended

    renewal provision ensured that Tribute’s gas storage rights were to continue
    indefinitely and that they were to do so on the terms set out in the 1998
    Tribute Gas Storage Lease. However, they would only continue indefinitely if
    the issue of gas storage rights had been taken to the OEB during the initial
    term of the 1998 Tribute Gas Storage Lease. Otherwise, gas storage rights would
    end.</span></p>
