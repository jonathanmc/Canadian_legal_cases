  <p class=Heard>Heard: September 11, 2013</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on May 2, 2012 and
    the sentence imposed on June 20, 2012 by Justice L.M. Baldwin of the Ontario
    Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p><strong>By the Court:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction and sentence on charges of
    threatening death, assault, sexual assault and breach of probation. Baldwin J.
    sentenced the appellant to a total of 6 years imprisonment in addition to 15.5
    months pre-sentence custody. At the conclusion of oral argument the court
    dismissed the conviction appeal but allowed the sentence appeal and reduced the
    effective global sentence to three years and 8.5 months, with reasons to
    follow.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the conviction appeal, the case turned on the assessment of
    credibility. The appellant and the complainant had known each other for many
    years and had an intimate relationship at various times. On the date of the
    offences, however, the complainant had made it clear that she did not want the
    appellant at her home. The essential dispute was whether, after an initial
    dispute, the complainant consented to sexual activity with the appellant. The
    appellant argues that the trial judge did not properly analyze credibility
    because she made the assessment solely on the basis of the assessment of the
    character of the appellant and the complainant and failed to consider the evidence
    of additional witnesses, such as the parties’ son and his girlfriend. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that the trial judge did not err in her assessment of
    credibility and provided adequate reasons for her findings. There was physical
    evidence in the form of injuries to the complainant that confirmed her
    testimony. The trial judge was entitled to consider the history of the
    relationship between the parties in making her assessment of credibility. That
    history was directly relevant since it explained the behaviour of both parties
    and informed the credibility assessment. This was not merely an exercise in
    reasoning from character. The trial judge made brief reference to the evidence
    of the other witnesses. In the circumstances that is all that was required,
    since there was little dispute that the central issue, the nature of the
    alleged sexual assault, depended almost entirely on the evidence of the
    appellant and the complainant. Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to sentence, in our view, the trial judge made several errors in
    principle. She exceeded the sentence sought by the Crown by a substantial
    amount, over two years, without giving the parties an opportunity to make
    submissions as to why the range suggested by counsel was inappropriate and failed
    to provide reasons for such a significant departure from the suggested range.
    Further, the sentence was manifestly excessive.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, defence counsel sought a sentence of thirty months
    imprisonment less credit for pre-sentence custody of 15.5 months. Crown counsel
    sought a sentence of 5 years less credit for pre-sentence custody. Both counsel
    relied upon this court’s decision in <em>R. v. B.R.</em> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d)
    641, where the court upheld a sentence of 30 months imprisonment for a sexual
    assault arising out of a domestic relationship. Crown counsel sought a higher
    sentence in the appellant’s case because of his record for offences of domestic
    violence involving this same complainant. Another helpful case in fixing the
    range for these types of offences is <em>R. v. Smith</em> (2011), 274 C.C.C.
    (3d) 34 (Ont. C.A.), which suggests a range of 21 months to four years for
    cases of forced sexual intercourse with a former spouse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the submissions of Crown counsel at trial that a global
    sentence in the range of five years less credit for pre-sentence custody was
    appropriate. A sentence greater than those imposed in <em>B.R.</em> and <em>Smith</em> was required given the history of abuse in this relationship, even though the
    earlier offences were less serious and involved much shorter periods of
    imprisonment. On the other hand, there was also reason to give some emphasis to
    rehabilitation. After many years of drug and alcohol addiction, the appellant
    had discontinued the use of illicit drugs and had substantially reduced his consumption
    of alcohol. The appellant was a skilled mechanic and had developed a plan to
    remove himself from any contact with the complainant by obtaining employment in
    Fort McMurray.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we agree with Mr. Di Luca that the trial judge’s offer to provide
    further written reasons should her decision be reviewed did not comply with her
    obligation to provide reasons for imposing a sentence substantially outside the
    range suggested by counsel. It would have been inappropriate to ask the trial
    judge for further reasons once her judgment was under appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal allowed and
    the sentence on count 4 is reduced to 2 years and 8.5 months imprisonment
    consecutive and the sentences on counts 5 and 6 are made concurrent to the
    other sentences imposed. The sentences imposed on the other counts will remain.
    In the result the appellant is serving a total sentence of 3 years and 8.5
    months imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We wish to thank Mr. Di Luca, who was retained only on the sentence
    appeal, for his assistance with the conviction appeal.</p>
