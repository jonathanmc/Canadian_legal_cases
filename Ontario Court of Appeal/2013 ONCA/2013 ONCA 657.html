  <p><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sought to certify a class action against Whirlpool Canada
    LP and Whirlpool Corporation (“Whirlpool”), alleging that their front-loading
    washing machines were poorly designed and prone to developing an unpleasant
    smell. They claimed damages for breach of express and implied warranty, breach
    of the <em>Competition Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34, negligence, and waiver
    of tort. The motion judge refused certification, concluding that none of the
    claims disclosed a cause of action. These appeals arise from that decision. </p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2001, Whirlpool began manufacturing front-loading clothes washing
    machines. Before this, Whirlpool had only manufactured the top-loading washing
    machines conventionally used in North America. The front-loading machines had
    significant advantages: they were more energy- and water-efficient and gentler
    on clothing than top-loading machines. However, they did not self-clean as well
    as top-loading machines.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By September 2003, Whirlpool began receiving some complaints about
    odour, mould or mildew.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whirlpool undertook efforts to improve its design: between 2001 and
    2008, it manufactured 14 successive models of its front-loading machines,
    incorporating various features intended to improve the machines’ ability to
    self-clean. While from the outset, Whirlpool’s User and Care Guides recommended
    the use of high efficiency (“HE”) detergents and provided cleaning instructions
    for the washer door, it modified its User and Care Guides to emphasize that
    only HE detergents should be used, to direct owners to clean the inside of the
    machines on a periodic basis, and to provide troubleshooting tips for odour
    problems. In September of 2007, it also began selling a cleaner in tablet form,
    called “Affresh”, to be used in the cleaning cycle to alleviate washer residue
    and odour.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2010, the appellants, Vijay Arora, Stacey Jacobs and Kathleen Oliver,
    launched this proposed class action on behalf of a class comprised of persons
    in Canada (other than Quebec) who own or previously owned a 2001 through 2008 model
    of a Whirlpool front-loading washing machine. They elected to sue Whirlpool,
    and not the retailers from which they purchased the machines.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> They allege that all these models suffer from common design defects that fail
    to prevent or adequately eliminate a buildup inside the machine of soap,
    softener, dirt and debris and to provide air circulation to allow the interior
    surfaces of the machine to dry once a wash has ended. This in turn is alleged
    to have resulted in the growth of mould, mildew, fungi and bacteria – referred
    to in the litigation as “biofilm” – and a musty or mouldy smell being imparted
    on clothes washed in the machine, the machine itself, and in the laundry room. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants do not allege that the front-loading machines are
    dangerous or allege injury to their health.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The appellants pleaded that they have incurred repair costs, but pleaded no
    particulars. Two of the three appellants pleaded their clothing was damaged by
    the smell imparted on them and that they incurred out-of-pocket expenses as a
    result, but pleaded no particulars and do not claim the expenses allegedly
    incurred or damaged clothing as a head of damages. While none of the appellants
    pleaded that he or she purchased Affresh, there was evidence that one of the
    appellants (Ms. Jacobs) did so, and the appellants also claim the cost of
    Affresh or similar cleaning tablets.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is conceded both that not all class members have sustained damage to
    their clothing, and that repair costs would be an individual issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The heart of the appellants’ claim, therefore, is that the machines
    purchased were shoddy goods that were not worth their purchase price. They seek
    what they style as damages for the overpayment – a form of rebate, or
    “diminution in value”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants advanced several claims: breach of express warranty;
    breach of implied warranty; breach of s. 52 of the <em>Competition Act</em>;
    negligence; and waiver of tort. Jurisprudentially, the most significant of
    their claims is in negligence for pure economic loss for negligent design against
    a manufacturer of a non-dangerous consumer product.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the motion for certification, the motion judge concluded that the pleadings did
    not disclose a cause of action. Moreover, he concluded that if he were wrong in
    determining that the appellants’ claim in negligence was not tenable, a class
    action was in any event not the preferable procedure for the resolution of
    their negligence claim. In two orders, the motion judge dismissed the
    certification motion and dismissed the appellants’ action against Whirlpool.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellants argue that the motion judge erred in concluding that the
    pleadings did not disclose a cause of action and that a class proceeding was
    not the preferable procedure for resolution of the negligence claim. I conclude
    that the motion judge did not err in determining that the pleadings do not
    disclose a cause of action, and would accordingly dismiss these appeals without
    the need to address the appellants’ arguments on the issue of preferable
    procedure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below,
    I address each of the pleaded claims in turn. However, I first briefly set out
    the approach that must be taken in determining whether the pleadings disclose a
    cause of action. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NO REASONABLE PROSPECT OF SUCCESS</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    proceeding will not be certified as a class proceeding if the pleadings do not
    disclose a cause of action: see s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em><i>,
    1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certification
    is to be denied on the basis that the requirement of s. 5(1)(a) is not met only
    “if, assuming the facts pleaded are true, it is plain and obvious that the
    pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action, meaning that the plaintiff
    has no reasonable prospect of success”: <em>Taylor v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>,
    2012 ONCA 479, 111 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 22, citing <em>Hunt v. Carey</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959</span></em><em>, </em>at p.
    980; <em>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</em>, 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R.
    45, at paras. 17-19; <em>Wellington v. Ontario</em>, 2011 ONCA 274, 105 O.R.
    (3d) 81, at para. 14, leave to appeal refused, [2011] S.C.C.A. No. 258. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Imperial Tobacco</em>, at paras. 19-21 and 25, McLachlin C.J. explained the
    delicate balance to be applied in determining if a claim has no reasonable
    chance of success:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The power to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect
    of success is a valuable housekeeping measure essential to effective and fair
    litigation. It unclutters the proceedings, weeding out the hopeless claims and
    ensuring that those that have some chance of success go on to trial. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>This promotes two goods – efficiency in the conduct of the
    litigation and correct results.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Valuable as it is, the motion to strike is a tool that must be
    used with care. The law is not static and unchanging. Actions that yesterday
    were deemed hopeless may tomorrow succeed…. The approach must be generous and
    err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to proceed to trial.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The judge on a motion to strike asks if the claim has any
    reasonable prospect of success. In the world of abstract speculation, there is
    a mathematical chance that any number of things might happen. That is not what
    the test on a motion to strike seeks to determine. Rather, it operates on the
    assumption that the claim will proceed through the court system in the usual
    way – in an adversarial system where judges are under a duty to apply the law as
    set out in (and as it may develop from) statutes and precedent. The question is
    whether, considered <em>in the context of the law and litigation process</em>,
    the claim has no reasonable chance of succeeding. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    keep this in mind in considering each of the claims pleaded by the appellants.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whirlpool
    provided three different forms of warranty during the period 2001-2008. Each
    warranty was limited to one year from the date of purchase and applicable only
    if the washer was operated and maintained according to instructions attached to
    or furnished with the product. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first, in effect from 2001-2006, provided that “Whirlpool Corporation will pay
    for FSP replacement parts and repair labor costs to correct defects in materials
    or workmanship.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second, in effect from 2006-2008, similarly provided that Whirlpool “will pay
    for Factory Specified Parts and repair labor to correct defects in materials or
    workmanship”. In addition, that warranty went on to provide that the “Customer’s
    sole and exclusive remedy under this limited warranty shall be product repair
    as provided herein”, and that Whirlpool was not liable for incidental or
    consequential damages. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third warranty, in effect from 2007-2008, is the same in all respects material
    to a consideration of the appellants’ express warranty claim as the second
    warranty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 181 of his reasons, the motion judge wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Plaintiffs do not sue to correct defects in materials or
    workmanship. They sue because they allege that the Whirlpool machines have a
    defective design. As a matter of contract interpretation, it is plain and
    obvious to me that their claim is not covered by the express warranty, that
    their claim is exculpated by the disclaimer language in the warranty, and there
    is no overriding public policy reasons (as there might be for a dangerous
    product) for not enforcing the express terms of the Whirlpool warranty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants do not argue that the motion judge erred in considering the wording
    of the express warranties that they pleaded Whirlpool breached in determining
    whether they had a tenable claim for breach of express warranty. They argue
    that it is not plain and obvious that their claims are not covered by the
    express warranties, and that the interpretation of the express warranties
    should be conducted at trial, on a full record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree. In my view, the motion judge correctly concluded that it is plain
    and obvious that the express warranties provided by Whirlpool do not cover the
    claims advanced by the appellants. As the motion judge noted, the appellants
    did not sue to correct defects in materials or workmanship. They sued alleging
    defective design. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also argue that the motion judge failed to consider that the
    warranties are analogous to contracts of adhesion, and to apply the principle
    of <em>contra preferentum</em>. This is indeed a situation in which the
    principle of <em>contra</em><i> <em>preferentum</em></i>, i.e., any ambiguity
    should be decided against the party that drafted the contract, would apply.
    However, this principle cannot assist the appellants, because there is no
    ambiguity in the language of the warranty. See e.g. <em>Canadian National
    Railway Co. v. Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance Co. of Canada</em>, 2008 SCC
    66, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 453, at para. 33; <em>Maher v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific
    Co. of Canada</em>, 2010 ONCA 415, 266 O.A.C. 173, at para. 51. I also note
    that two of the appellants pleaded that their machines were purchased in 2004,

    show that the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment, and the goods are
    of a description that it is in the course of the seller’s business to supply (whether
    the seller is the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the
    goods will be reasonably fit for such purpose, but in the case of a contract
    for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name there
    is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>2. Where goods are bought by description from a seller who
    deals in goods of that description (whether the seller is the manufacturer or

    as regards defects that such examination ought to have revealed.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>3. An implied warranty or condition as to quality or fitness

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whirlpool
    argues that it is plain and obvious that s. 15 of the SGA does not apply
    because it is not a “seller” within the meaning of the SGA vis-à-vis the
    appellants. It relies on the wording of the SGA and <em>Mann-Tattersall
    (Litigation guardian of) v. Hamilton (City) </em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>(2000)</span></em>, 38 C.L.R. (3d) 255 (Ont. Sup. Ct.). In <em>Mann-Tattersall</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 31</span></em><i>,</i> the court held that
    “[a] party cannot advance a claim for breach of any of the implied warranties
    provided for in the [SGA] against a party with whom it has no privity of
    contract.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, the appellants point to <em>Caputo v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (2004)</span></em>, 236 D.L.R. (4th) 348 (Ont.
    S.C.), at paras. 22 and 23, which was decided after <em>Mann-Tattersall</em>. <em>Caputo</em> was a certification motion for a proposed class action seeking damages for
    personal injuries caused by the use of cigarettes. The numerous causes of action
    pleaded included breach of implied warranty. While the SGA was not specifically
    pleaded, the tobacco manufacturers relied on it, as well as <em>Dunlop
    Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Selfridge &amp; Co. Ltd.</em>, [1915] A.C. 847 (H.L.),
    and <em>Mann-Tattersall</em>, to argue at para. 20 that where (as here) “a
    retailer sells goods to the ultimate consumer, the consumer cannot sue the
    manufacturer on implied warranties.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Caputo</em>, Winkler J. (as he then was) referred to <em>Fraser River Pile
    &amp; Dredge Ltd. v. Can-Dive Services Ltd.</em>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 108, which
    established a two-part test to determine when a new exception should be made to
    the law regarding privity of contract. He concluded that, in light of <em>Fraser
    River</em>, it was not plain and obvious that the plaintiffs could not succeed
    in establishing that an exception to the doctrine of privity of contract might
    apply in the circumstances of that case. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that Whirlpool did not sell the machines directly to consumers is critical
    to the viability of the appellants’ implied warranty claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that individuals resident in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick could have
    a cause of action against Whirlpool for breach of the warranty of fitness for
    purpose implied under the sale of goods legislation in those provinces. In Saskatchewan
    and New Brunswick, legislation expressly provides that lack of privity does not
    defeat a third party’s claim for damages as a result of a breach of an implied
    warranty: see <em>Consumer Protection Act</em>, S.S. 1996, c. C-30.1, at s. 55; <em>Law Reform Act</em>, R.S.N.B. 2011, c. 184, at s. 4(1).  Accordingly,
    subject to certain requirements, a consumer in those provinces can claim
    directly against a manufacturer if a product fails to conform to the implied
    warranties of fitness and quality. The appellants, however, are all resident in
    Ontario and therefore cannot.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge that the appellants’ claim against Whirlpool for
    breach of the warranty of fitness for purpose implied under the SGA has no
    reasonable prospect of success. Their remedy under the SGA is against the
    seller, and in this case Whirlpool was not the seller. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    on the contractual provision the very activities contemplated as coming within
    the scope of the contract in general, or the provision in particular, again as
    determined by reference to the intentions of the parties? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants pleaded as follows with respect to the SGA:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>31A. Further, the defendants were subject to an express
    warranty and/or implied warranty at common law or under the <em>Sale of Goods
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.1 (or equivalent in other provinces) to supply the
    Whirlpool Front-loaders free from material defects and fit for their intended
    use.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>38A.The defendants breached their express or implied warranty
    (pleaded in para. 31A) when they supplied the Whirlpool front-loaders because,
    as pleaded above, these machines were not free from material defects or fit for
    their intended use. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my reading, the appellants assert a direct, implied warranty from Whirlpool to
    the appellants. To possibly fit within <em>Fraser River</em>, the appellants
    must plead that the contracts between Whirlpool and its many retailers included
    the implied condition that the appellants seek to rely on, and that Whirlpool
    and the retailers intended to extend the benefit of that implied warranty to
    class members who purchased machines from those retailers. They have not done
    so, and it cannot be assumed that the contracts between Whirlpool and its
    retailers include such an implied condition. Section 53 of the SGA provides
    that the parties may contract out of such a term, expressly or otherwise. As
    pleaded, <i>Fraser River</i> does not assist the appellants.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    even if there were such an implied condition between Whirlpool and the
    retailers, the appellants’ SGA claim cannot succeed as it relates to class
    members such as the representative plaintiff Ms. Jacobs, who did not buy her
    washing machine from a retailer but rather acquired it from its original owner
    when she purchased a new house. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    not argued, I also note that <em>Fraser River</em> recognizes an exception to
    the doctrine of privity of contract to <i>protect</i> a party from liability,
    not to permit a party to sue. Thus that case does not establish the particular
    exception to privity that the appellants would require. While <em>Fraser River</em> and its predecessor<i>, <em>London Drugs Ltd. v. Kuhne &amp; Nagel Ltd.</em></i>,
    [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299, do allow for additional exceptions to be recognized in
    certain circumstances, those exceptions must be incremental: see <em>Fraser
    River</em>, at para. 43-44; <em>Brown v. Belleville (City)</em>, 2013 ONCA 148,
    114 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 97. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had
    the appellants pleaded that the contracts between Whirlpool and the retailers
    included the implied condition on which they seek to rely, and that Whirlpool
    and the retailers intended to extend the benefit of that provision to the
    appellants, they would also have to establish that allowing the third party
    appellants to sue under those contracts would be an incremental change to the
    doctrine of privity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Vandewal v. Vandewal</em>, [2002] O.J. No. 393 (S.C.), Robertson J. would
    have allowed such a claim, and that decision and the reasons were upheld by
    this court: 2003 CanLII 1002 (ON CA). However, that part of the trial judge’s
    reasons was clearly <em>obiter</em>. The B.C. Court of Appeal has concluded
    that such an extension of privity is a “monumental change” that goes “well
    beyond anything contemplated” by <em>London Drugs</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> or </span></em><em>Fraser River</em>: see <em>Kitimat
    (District) v. Alcan Inc.</em>, 2006 BCCA 75, 265 D.L.R. (4th) 462, at paras.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have concluded that, as pleaded, <em>Fraser River</em> does not apply, it is
    unnecessary for me to decide whether I would endorse the B.C. Court of Appeal’s
    conclusion in <em>Holmes</em>, and it is preferable that such a determination
    await a case where argument is squarely focussed on that issue. It is also
    unnecessary for me to address the question of whether the warranties the
    appellants allege were implied were, in fact, disclaimed by the language of the
    express warranties.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge noted that the appellants did not plead a common express

    Whirlpool did not tell them that the front-loading washing machines they were
    buying did not self-clean in the same way as top-loading washing machines and
    were susceptible to the buildup of biofilm, resulting in unpleasant odours, and
    that moreover the machines had design defects that exacerbated this
    susceptibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    paras. 194-195, the motion judge acknowledged that “in some circumstances
    silence may constitute a misrepresentation”, but noted that “as a general rule,
    however, silence is not a representation, unless there is a duty of care, a
    statutory duty to disclose, or a fiduciary duty to speak”. He concluded, at
    para. 197:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[S]ince the alleged design defect in the washing machines did
    not make the machines dangerous, it is plain and obvious that Whirlpool was not
    under an obligation to disparage its own product and disclose the alleged

    duty to disclose, and no statutory duty to disclose. It was entitled to remain
    silent, and in my opinion, it is plain and obvious that it did not commit an

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whirlpool
    does not dispute the principle that misrepresentation by omission may be

    implication does not form the basis of a tenable claim. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that where, as here, there is no common express representation pleaded
    which could convert an omission into a misrepresentation by implication, and
    there is no duty to disclose, it is plain and obvious that a claim for breach
    of s. 52 cannot succeed. Section 52 of the <em>Competition Act</em> does
    prohibit “material” false or misleading representations. However, unlike
    statutes such as provincial securities legislation, which require the provision
    of “full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts” (see e.g.<i> <em>Securities
    Act</em></i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S-5, s. 56(1)), the <em>Competition Act</em> does

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span

    would note and adopt the holding in <em>Williams v. Canon</em>, at para. 227,
    that “the failure to disclose the alleged defect cannot be a ‘representation’”
    for the purpose of s. 52. The appellants argue that this analysis by Strathy J.
    (as he then was) was both <em>obiter</em> and incorrect. However, the authority
    they cite (Allen Linden &amp; Bruce Feldthusen, <em>Canadian Tort Law</em>, 9th
    ed. (Markham, LexisNexis: 2011), at p. 470) does not support them; it deals
    with misrepresentations in negligence as opposed to under the <em>Competition
    Act</em>, and merely recognizes what Whirlpool concedes, namely that in some
    circumstances omissions can constitute misrepresentations. <em>Spinks</em><i> </i>and <em>Knight</em> merely recognize the same undisputed principle. If <em>obiter</em>,
    Strathy J.’s conclusion is in any event persuasive.</p>

  <p class=CQuote>[I]t has been recognized that in limited circumstances damages
    for economic loss absent physical or proprietary harm may be recovered. The
    circumstances in which such damages have been awarded to date are few. To a
    large extent, this caution derives from the same policy rationale that
    supported the traditional approach not to recognize the claim at all. First,
    economic interests are viewed as less compelling of protection than bodily
    security or proprietary interests. Second, an unbridled recognition of economic
    loss raises the spectre of indeterminate liability. Third, economic losses
    often arise in a commercial context where they are often an inherent business
    risk best guarded against by the party on whom they fall through such means as
    insurance. Finally, allowing the recovery of economic loss through tort has
    been seen to encourage a multiplicity of inappropriate lawsuits. [Citations

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em>, the Supreme Court considered whether there were
    policy reasons to negate a duty of care in a case that involved a shoddy
    structure. The building at issue, a condominium, was not only shoddy, but
    dangerous. La Forest J., writing for a unanimous court, distinguished, on a
    policy level, between “dangerous” and “shoddy” defects. He concluded, at para.
    12, that “compelling policy reasons exist for the imposition upon contractors
    of tortious liability for the cost of repair of these [dangerous] defects.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crucially
    for our purposes, La Forest J. expressly declined to consider whether a similar
    duty should be recognized when the defect is not dangerous. He stated, at para.
    41:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given the clear presence of a real and substantial danger in
    this case, I do not find it necessary to consider whether contractors should
    also in principle be held to owe a duty to subsequent purchasers for the cost
    of repairing non-dangerous defects in buildings…. I would require argument more
    squarely focused on the issue before entertaining this possibility. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The washing machines in this case are alleged to be
    shoddy, but not dangerous.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The motion judge’s reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s analysis is detailed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    brief, the motion judge interpreted <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> and subsequent authorities</span></em> as settling
    that there is no product-liability negligence action for pure economic loss
    against a manufacturer for negligently designing a non-dangerous consumer
    product. He accordingly concluded that it was plain and obvious that the
    appellants’ negligence claim could not succeed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then went on to consider whether, if he were wrong in concluding
    that <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em> had settled the issue, it was nonetheless
    plain and obvious from the application of the two-stage <em>Anns</em> test that
    the appellants’ negligence claim could not succeed. The motion judge determined
    that, assuming that the relationship between the appellants and Whirlpool was
    sufficient to give rise to a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care, and the
    appellants’ claim therefore survived the first stage of the test, there were
    overriding policy considerations that negated that duty of care. It was
    therefore plain and obvious that the appellants’ claim could not survive the
    second stage of the test and a duty of care could not be found to exist. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citing <em>Martel Building</em>, the motion judge relied on what he described, at
    para. 280, as “the traditional factors that justified the traditional rule that
    pure economic losses are not recoverable in negligence.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 281, the motion judge acknowledged “that the spectre of indeterminate
    liability, a commonly mentioned policy reason for negating a duty of care with
    respect to pure economic losses, is not a factor in the case at bar.” The
    members of the class economically harmed could be identified and their losses
    were not unbounded.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 288, he set out his view of the underlying policy theme of <em>Martel
    Building</em>: “[C]ompensation for economic losses are best regulated by
    contract and property law and … there must be some countervailing policy to
    justify tort law regulating an economic activity.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded, at para. 289:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the context of the case at bar, the same negating policy
    themes identified by the court in <em>Martel Building</em> apply and indicate
    that the Plaintiffs should be left to their contractual remedies including
    express, implied, or statutory warranties and they should not look to tort law
    to negotiate a better bargain for themselves. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The appellants’ submissions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants make four main arguments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they say that the motion judge failed to appreciate the nature of the damages
    suffered. He did not consider that two of the three appellants pleaded damage
    to clothing – a musty or mouldy smell imparted on clothes washed in the
    machines – and resultant out-of-pocket expenses. Therefore, they submit, the
    motion judge mischaracterized their claim in negligence as one for pure
    economic loss, as opposed to one arising from damage to property. Similarly,
    they submit that the cost claimed of buying the Affresh tablets manufactured by
    Whirlpool or similar cleaning tablets for use in cleaning the machines are
    mitigation damages, to prevent further damage to property (the clothes washed
    in the machines), and not pure economic loss.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Second, the appellants submit that the motion judge
    erred in concluding that </span></em><em>Winnipeg Condominium</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> decided the question of whether a manufacturer is
    liable in tort for pure economic loss arising from a defective, non-dangerous
    consumer product. They submit that this remains an open question in Canadian
    tort law.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellants say the motion judge should not have undertaken the policy
    analysis required to decide the duty of care issue without the benefit of a
    full factual record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants submit that the motion judge erred in concluding that their
    negligence claim had no reasonable prospect of success.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    deal with each of the appellants’ arguments in turn.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The appellants do not have a claim for damage to property </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge did not err in concluding that the appellants’ claim
    was not one for damage to property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Whirlpool argues, the appellants conceded that their negligence claim was one
    for pure economic loss.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> The appellants seek to re-characterize their claim on appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellants amended their statement of claim several times, they did not
    claim clothing as a head of damages. This was not an oversight: only two of the
    three appellants pleaded that their clothing was damaged because a smell was
    imparted on them, and counsel for the appellants conceded in the course of
    submissions that many of the proposed class members may not have suffered
    “damage” to their clothing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the appellants who alleged that their clothing was damaged because a smell was
    imparted on them did not plead that the smell was in any way lasting, that they
    were unable to wear their clothing as a result, or that there was any physical
    damage to the clothing. The proposition that such <em>de minimis</em><i> </i>harm
    could give rise to an actionable negligence claim is dubious.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Rothwell v Chemical and Insulating Co.</em>, [2007] UKHL 39, [2008] 1 A.C.
    281, at para. 8, Lord Hoffman affirmed the familiar principle that “[a]n action
    for compensation should not be set in motion on account of a trivial injury. <em>De
    minimis non curat lex</em><i>.</i>” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    written in the context of tort liability for psychiatric injury, McLachlin
    C.J.’s comments from <em>Mustapha v. Culligan</em>, 2008 SCC 27, [2008] 2
    S.C.R. 114, at para. 9, are apt: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The law does not recognize upset, disgust, anxiety, agitation
    or other mental states that fall short of injury.&nbsp; I would not purport to
    define compensable injury exhaustively, except to say that it must be serious
    and prolonged and rise above the ordinary annoyances, anxieties and fears that
    people living in society routinely, if sometimes reluctantly, accept.&nbsp; The
    need to accept such upsets rather than seek redress in tort is what I take the
    Court of Appeal to be expressing in its quote from <em>Vanek v. Great Atlantic
    &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada</em> (1999), 48 O.R. (3d) 228 (C.A.): “Life goes
    on” (para. 60).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the cost of buying the Affresh tablets, as noted above, none of the
    appellants pleaded that he or she purchased Affresh, and the evidence was that
    only one of them (Ms. Jacobs) did. Agreeing as I do that the appellants’ claim
    in negligence is not, in substance, one for physical damage to property, I
    would not characterize the cost of purchasing Affresh as an expense incurred to
    prevent damage to property. </p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred in concluding that <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em> settled that there is no recovery in tort for defective, non-dangerous consumer
    products </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellants that <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em> did not settle
    that there is no recovery in tort for economic loss caused by defective,
    non-dangerous consumer products.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em>, a condominium corporation – the subsequent
    purchaser of a building – sued the general contractor responsible for the
    construction of the building for the cost of repairing structural defects in
    the masonry work on the outside of the building. The damages incurred – the
    cost of repairing the cladding – were purely economic. The Supreme Court held
    that the condominium could recover the cost of repairing the defects because
    they posed a real and substantial danger. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 36, La Forest J. explained:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If a contractor can be held liable in tort where he or she
    constructs a building negligently and, as a result of that negligence, the
    building causes damage to persons or property, it follows that the contractor
    should also be held liable in cases where the dangerous defect is discovered
    and the owner of the building wishes to mitigate the danger by fixing the
    defect and putting the building back into a non-dangerous state. In both cases,
    the duty in tort serves to protect the bodily integrity and property interests
    of the inhabitants of the building.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>I repeat for ease of reference his comments, at para.
    41: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given the clear presence of a real and substantial danger in this
    case, I do not find it necessary to consider whether contractors should also in
    principle be held to owe a duty to subsequent purchasers for the cost of
    repairing non-dangerous defects in buildings…. I would require argument more
    squarely focused on the issue before entertaining this possibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Supreme Court carefully left the issue of whether there should be
    no recovery for pure economic loss where goods are shoddy, but not dangerous,
    for another day. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion:
    see <em>Sable Offshore Energy Inc. v. Ameron International Corp.</em>, 2007
    NSCA 70, 255 N.S.R. (2d) 164, leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 425.
    Academic commentary is to the same effect: in <em>Economic Negligence</em>, at
    p. 195, Professor Feldthusen states that the Supreme Court “expressly left the
    question of negligence liability for non-dangerous defects open for future
    consideration.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did the other authority principally relied on by the motion judge – this
    court’s decision in <em>Mariani v. Lemstra</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'> (2004)</span></em>, 246 D.L.R. (4th) 489, leave to appeal refused,
    [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 355 – settle the issue in Ontario. Like <em>Winnipeg
    Condominium</em>, <em>Mariani</em> involved a dangerous defect in a building.
    The issue was whether or not the plaintiff fell within the principle in <em>Winnipeg
    Condominium</em>, not whether that principle should be extended to
    non-dangerous consumer goods.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Ducharme
    v. Solarium de Paris Inc.</em>, [2008] O.J. No. 1558, a more recent decision of
    the Divisional Court also relied on by the motion judge, similarly involved the
    integrity of a structure. <em>Ducharme</em> was indeed binding on the motion
    judge, and it clearly states that there can be no recovery for economic loss
    for shoddy products absent danger to property or persons. However, the Divisional
    Court simply asserted, at para. 23, that there can be no liability, without any
    analysis or support other than <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em><i> </i>– which, as
    discussed above, does not establish or preclude such liability. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>However, as I explained above, the motion judge
    proceeded to analyse the appellants’ claim for economic loss as if the issue were
    not yet settled. He assumed that the appellants had established a </span></em><em>prima
    facie</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> duty of care at step one of </span></em><em>Anns</em><i> </i>but held that the duty should be negated for policy reasons at step two. He <em><span style='font-style:normal'>therefore concluded that the appellants’
    negligence claim had no reasonable prospect of success. </span></em></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was entitled to decide the issue on the certification
    motion without the need for a trial </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the motion judge erred in conducting a policy analysis
    without a full evidentiary record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court commented in <em>Haskett v. Equifax</em> (2003), O.R. (3d) 577, a
    judge must proceed cautiously if she conducts a stage two policy analysis under
    the <em>Anns</em> test on a pre-trial motion. Feldman J.A. explained, at para.
    24, that while the judge may well recognize potential policy concerns at the
    second stage, she should be circumspect in using those policy concerns to
    decide the “plain and obvious” question without a statement of defence and
    without any evidence. She cautioned, at para. 52: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>A court should be reluctant to dismiss a claim as disclosing no
    reasonable cause of action based on policy reasons at the motion stage before
    there is a record on which a court can analyze the strengths and weaknesses of
    the policy arguments…. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    certain circumstances, however, a policy analysis can be conducted on a
    pleadings motion: the detailed policy analysis conducted by the Supreme Court
    in <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em> resulting in a conclusive recognition of a
    duty of care was undertaken on appeal from a pleadings motion. Doherty J.A. in <em>Taylor</em>,
    at para. 22, provides some guidance: “If the question gives rise to genuine
    legal or factual uncertainties, it cannot be answered at this stage and the
    answer must await a trial and a complete record.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also important to consider what, in a particular case, a factual record
    could reasonably be expected to add to the court’s determination. In <em>Andersen
    v. St. Jude Medical Inc.</em>, 2012 ONSC 3660 (appeal to the Court of Appeal
    listed for November 25-29, 2013), Lax J., concluded at the end of trial that
    the full record before her would not have assisted her in deciding whether the
    plaintiffs’ waiver of tort claim was a viable cause of action in Ontario. She
    provided the following insight, which in my view is not limited to the waiver
    of tort issue, at paras. 585 and 587:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The extensive factual record that was developed during a 138
    day trial did not illuminate for me the important issues of policy that were
    meant to arise from the trial record. The written submissions of the parties
    did not rely on any evidence from the factual record in advancing arguments to
    support or oppose extending the waiver of tort doctrine to a negligence case.
    The plaintiffs did not lead any policy evidence to explain why waiver of tort
    should be available in a product liability negligence case.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While generally, courts are reluctant to determine unsettled
    matters of law at a pre-trial stage and particularly on a pleadings motion,
    there is certainly precedent for doing this…. My experience from this trial
    suggests that deciding the waiver of tort issue does not necessarily require a
    trial and that it may be possible to resolve the debate in some other way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts pleaded in this case, it is doubtful that a full factual record would
    have been of assistance to the trial judge in deciding the legal question of
    whether Whirlpool owes the appellants a duty of care.  As discussed above, the
    pleading raises the most minimal allegations of harm.  This is not a case where
    a trial is needed to see how much of what is claimed is actually proved. Nor
    did counsel provide any meaningful indication of the nature of the policy
    evidence the appellants would lead if the matter proceeded to trial. And unlike
    in <em>Haskett</em>, a statement of defence was before the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, the motion judge had the benefit of a significant body of
    jurisprudence to assist in answering this precise question: see e.g. <em>Ducharme</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>;</span></em><em> Zidaric v. Toshiba of Canada Ltd.</em> (2000), 5 C.C.L.T. (3d) 61 (Ont. S.C.); <em>M. Hasegawa &amp; Co. v. Pepsi
    Bottling Group (Canada) Co.</em> (2002), 213 D.L.R. (4th) 663. This indicates
    that the issue is not an entirely novel one. Moreover, in this case there is an
    existing, relevant statutory framework, discussed below, as well as abundant
    academic commentary on the subject of tort liability for shoddy, non-dangerous
    consumer goods. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in my view, the continued uncertainty in the law in this area promotes
    increased litigation and litigation costs that hinder the access-to-justice
    function of class proceedings. This case is illustrative: costs against the
    appellants for the certification motion, as agreed to by the parties, were
    $278,500. The negligence issue significantly complicated the certification
    motion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Abella J. held in <em>Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D.</em>, 2007 SCC
    38, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83, at para. 19, the benefit of testing the viability of a
    novel claim on a Rule 21 motion is obvious: “If there is no legally recognized
    duty of care … there is no legal justification for a protracted and expensive
    trial.” Access to justice would not be served by forcing these parties on to an
    even more costly trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the motion judge did not err in deciding the appellants’
    negligence claim on the certification motion. </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The motion judge was correct to
    conclude that the appellants’ negligence claim had no reasonable prospect of success</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    its core, the appellants’ economic loss claim is for diminution in value – that
    is, the difference in value between the product they thought they were getting
    and the one they actually received. In my view, it is clear that such a claim
    has no reasonable prospect of success in light of the jurisprudence and the
    relevant statutory framework, both of which I discuss in more detail below. </p>

    Condominium</em></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is trite to observe that the law is not static and unchanging,
    recognizing the possibility of tort liability on the pleaded facts of this case
    would represent such a quantum leap that it is plain and obvious the
    appellants’ negligence claim will not succeed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have explained, in <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em>, the plaintiff was entitled
    to recover the reasonable cost of putting the building into a non-dangerous
    state. The Supreme Court specifically disallowed the cost of any repairs that
    would merely improve the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>quality</span></em> of the building. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>LaForest
    J. concluded that policy considerations did not negate a contractor’s duty to
    ensure that the building is free from defects that “pose foreseeable and
    substantial danger to the health and safety of the occupants” (para. 54). Risk
    of indeterminate liability was not a concern: the class of claimants was
    limited to the very persons for whom the building was constructed; the quantum
    of damages recoverable was limited to the reasonable cost of repairing the
    building to a non-dangerous state and mitigating the danger; and the contractor
    was only liable during the useful life of the building. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    “warranties respecting quality of construction are primarily contractual in
    nature and cannot be easily defined or limited in tort” (para. 44), it was
    appropriate to recognize a tort duty to construct a building without dangerous
    defects, independent of contract. The court held that the doctrine of <em>caveat
    emptor</em> should not shield a contractor from liability for dangerous
    defects. Because of their expertise, contractors and builders are in a better
    position to ensure that buildings are free from dangerous latent defects than
    purchasers are to detect them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extension of
    liability in <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em> derived from conventional concerns
    of protection of bodily integrity and property interests. Here, the appellants
    have abandoned their claim that the washing machines pose a real and
    substantial danger to their health and safety and to the physical well-being of
    the proposed class members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As discussed
    above, the case is not about damage to property. Nor is the primary relief
    sought even damages for what might normally be considered economic loss. This
    case is not about the cost of repairs and replacement parts – an individual
    issue, requiring proof – or losses arising from the fact that allegedly defective
    products were not available for use. On the contrary, the pleadings suggest
    that the representative plaintiffs continued to own and use their Whirlpool
    washing machines even after the litigation was commenced.<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the
    appellants accept that design changes Whirlpool made to machines manufactured
    in 2007-2008 sufficiently (although not completely) alleviated the problem of
    biofilm buildup and resultant odours. They concede that such machines should be
    excluded from the class definition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of
    the relief that the appellants seek is expectation damages for breach of
    contract, calculated as if Whirlpool had warranted that the machines they were
    purchasing would be of the same quality as machines subsequently designed and
    manufactured by Whirlpool in 2007-2008. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At its heart,
    the appellants’ claim is that they paid more for their washing machines than
    they are worth. It is squarely about relative product quality – a matter that,
    as LaForest J. noted in <em>Winnipeg Condominium</em>, is customarily dealt
    with by contract and not easily defined by tort. In my view, requiring the
    courts to analyze a myriad of consumer transactions – some involving small
    outlays of money for goods that quickly depreciate and become redundant – in
    tort, without the framework of consumer protection legislation, to determine
    whether the consumer received value for his or her money, would burden an
    already taxed court system.  </p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commercial vs. Consumer transactions and consumer protection legislation</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants
    submit that the policy considerations which may negate the duty of care in the
    commercial context should not apply in the consumer context.  Unlike both <em>Martel
    Building</em><i> </i>and <em>Hasegawa</em>, where the courts held that the
    parties’ commercial contracts already allocated the risk for poor quality,
    consumers like the appellants are not in a position to negotiate contractual
    warranties provided by manufacturers. Their choice is not to buy. I accept
    these submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree
    with the appellants that a major impetus for class proceedings legislation in
    Ontario was to provide access to justice for consumer claims, including those
    for defective products. See for example the <em>Ontario Law Reform Commission’s
    Report on Class Actions (Toronto: Ministry of the Attorney General, 1982)</em> at p. 121, citing <em>Naken v. General Motors Ltd.</em> (1978), 21 O.R. (2d)
    780, at pp. 784-785, rev’d on other grounds, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 72.  I would also
    note that McLachlin C.J. in <em>Western Canadian Shopping Centres Inc. v.
    Dutton</em>, 2001 SCC 46, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 534, at paras. 26-29, in discussing
    the role of class proceedings and their three advantages – judicial economy,
    access to justice, and behaviour modification – specifically mentioned faulty
    consumer products. I further recognize that, where the manufacturer, as opposed
    to the retailer, is the defendant, the class would be larger, and the
    litigation therefore often more economical.<span style='background:yellow'> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other
    hand, it is noteworthy that the legislature has enacted broad consumer
    protection legislation: in Ontario, the <em>Business Practices Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.18</span></em><em> </em>(the
    “BPA”) in respect of consumer agreements entered into before July 30, 2005, and
    the significantly expanded <em>Consumer Protection Act</em> (the “CPA”) in
    respect of consumer transactions entered on or after that day. This legislation
    applies to the purchase of a washing machine.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the BPA and
    the CPA permit a consumer to claim against a manufacturer who engages in an
    “unfair practice”, which is defined to include false, misleading, deceptive and
    unconscionable representations. Under the BPA and the CPA, damages are an
    available remedy. In certain cases where rescission is not available, remedies
    for an unfair practice include recovery of an amount by which payment under the
    consumer agreement exceeds the value that the goods have to the consumer. This
    is essentially the remedy that the appellants seek in this litigation without
    pleading an unfair practice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While both the
    CPA and the BPA require a consumer to give notice if the consumer wishes to rescind
    the agreement or otherwise seek recovery (within one year in the case of the
    CPA and 6 months in the case of the BPA after entering into the impugned
    consumer agreement), under the CPA the court may disregard the notice
    requirement if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The CPA also
    incorporates the implied conditions and warranties under the SGA and provides
    that they apply despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that the
    appellants abandoned their claim under the CPA prior to the certification
    motion. While I cannot speculate as to their reasons for doing so, there was no
    argument before the court that these statutory provisions were difficult,
    expensive, inconvenient or otherwise inadequate.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    providing these remedies against manufacturers and many other protections for
    consumers, the CPA does not provide an exception to privity of contract so as
    to allow consumers to recover against manufacturers for breach of implied
    warranties of quality or fitness for purpose. Other jurisdictions have done so
    in their equivalent legislation; see for example <em><span style='font-style:
normal'>Saskatchewan’s </span></em><em>Consumer Protection Act</em>, S.S. 1996,
    c. C-30.1, s. 55, which predates the Ontario CPA.<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[8]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the CPA was
    first passed, the Ontario legislature’s Standing Committee on Finance and Economic
    Affairs received a written submission highlighting this problem of privity as
    between manufacturers and consumers, but rejected a proposed amendment that
    would have attempted to address the issue.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[9]</span></span></span></a> In the more than ten years since then, the legislature has made multiple
    substantive amendments to the CPA but has not changed the law in this respect.<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Iacobucci J.
    observed at para. 43 of <em>Fraser River</em>, “the legislature is better
    placed to appreciate and accommodate the economic and policy issues involved in
    introducing sweeping legal reforms.” Where, as here, the legislature considered
    and did not enact the doctrinal change that would provide the consumer remedy
    against Whirlpool that the appellants seek, there is in my view no reasonable
    prospect that a court would fundamentally alter the law of negligence to
    effectively provide such a remedy. The legislature – which has signalled its
    intention to regulate consumer transactions through the enactment of consumer
    protection legislation – should make any such change, after taking into account
    all relevant considerations, and input from all stakeholders. The court, after
    a trial between private parties, could not hope to be sufficiently versed in
    the implications of such a change. It is illusory to think that it would make
    such a significant change to the law based on any factual record that might
    develop at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in
    determining whether the law of negligence should be extended in this case, it
    must be remembered that this is not a case where the appellants were without a
    remedy. The SGA and CPA provided a statutory remedy against the seller of the
    machines for breach of implied warranties of quality and fitness for purpose,
    and the BPA and the CPA provided remedies against Whirlpool for unfair
    practices.</p>
  <h5 style='page-break-after:avoid'>Conclusion</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming,
    as the motion judge did, that a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care is made out
    on the pleaded facts, in my view policy considerations negate recognizing a
    cause of action in negligence for diminution in value for a defective,
    non-dangerous consumer product. On the pleaded facts, I agree with the motion
    judge that the appellants should be left to their statutory and contractual
    remedies, including express, implied or statutory warranties, and “should not
    look to tort law to negotiate a better bargain for themselves” (para. 28). </p>
  <h1>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WAIVER OF TORT</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    held that the appellants’ waiver of tort claim failed to satisfy s. 5(1)(a) of
    the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em><i> </i>because there was no predicate
    wrongdoing upon which to base a plea of waiver of tort, be it a remedy or a
    cause of action. He provided a helpful summary of the state of the law on
    waiver of tort, at paras. 297-299: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The last cause of action to consider is the claim
    of waiver of tort. One could write a lot about this topic, but for present
    purposes I can be brief. Historically, the doctrine of waiver of tort provided
    the victim of certain types of tortious wrongdoing with the option of foregoing
    (waiving) tort compensation measured by the damages suffered by the victim and
    claim instead disgorgement of the tortfeasor’s ill-gotten gains. The
    traditional view was that waiver of tort was a remedy available for certain
    torts.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Without deciding the point, </span><em>Serhan v.
    Johnson &amp; </em><em>Johnson </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>[(2006),
    85 O.R. (3d) 665 (Div. Ct.), leave to appeal to C.A. refused, Oct. 16, 2006, </span></em>leave
    to appeal that denial of leave to S.C.C. refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 494<em><span
style='font-style:normal'>],</span></em><span lang=EN> initiated a debate about
    whether waiver of tort was not just a remedial choice but rather a cause of
    action available for more than the traditional short list of torts for which it
    had been available as a remedy or perhaps for wrongdoing generally. In other
    words, there has been a debate about the doctrinal nature of waiver of tort and
    the range of its availability. There, however, has been one point beyond
    debating. Whether a remedy or a cause of action, for waiver of tort to be
    available, the defendant must have done something wrong.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In <em>Aronowicz v. Emtwo Properties Inc.</em>, [2010 ONCA 96,
    98 O.R. (3d) 641], at para. 82, Justice Blair stated about the waiver of tort
    doctrine:&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>82. Whether the claim exists as an independent
    cause of action or whether it requires proof of all the elements of an
    underlying tort aside, at the very least, waiver of tort requires some form of
    wrongdoing. The motion judge found none here. No breach of contract. No breach
    of fiduciary duty, or duty of good faith or confidentiality. No oppression. No
    misrepresentation. No deceit. No conspiracy. As counsel for Mr. Grinshpan put
    it in their factum, &quot;its eleventh hour insertion into the statement of
    claim does not provide the appellants' claim with a new lifeline given that the
    record discloses no wrongful conduct on the part of the respondents in respect of
    any of the causes of action pleaded.&quot;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The motion judge concluded, at paras. 300-301:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the case at bar, for the reasons discussed earlier, in my
    opinion, it is plain and<span lang=EN> obvious that there is no predicate
    wrongdoing upon which to base a plea of waiver of tort. All of the proposed
    causes of action are untenable and thus there is no predicate wrongdoing to
    support a claim of waiver of tort be it a remedy or a cause of action.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Accordingly, the waiver of tort claim also fails to satisfy <a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’
    primary submission is that the motion judge erred in finding that the claim for
    waiver of tort was untenable because all of the proposed causes of action were
    untenable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> With respect to
    their negligence claim, I understand them to argue in the alternative that if a <em>prima</em> <em>facie</em> duty of care is negated on policy grounds, but a
    breach of such a duty of care, had one been found to exist, is established,
    there would be sufficient wrongful conduct to ground a claim for waiver of
    tort.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I have
    concluded that the appellants did not plead a tenable cause of action and agree
    with the motion judge that there is therefore no predicate wrongdoing upon
    which to base a plea of waiver of tort. I also conclude that the appellants’
    alternative argument is without merit; if no duty of care is established, there
    is no legal wrong doing and no basis to argue waiver of tort. </p>
