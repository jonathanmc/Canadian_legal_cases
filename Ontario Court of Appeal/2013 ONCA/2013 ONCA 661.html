  <h1>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brian Saliba was charged with three offences arising out of his sexual
    activity with H., a 14 year old girl (counts 1-3).  He was also charged with
    several offences arising out of his sexual activity with A., a 15 year old girl
    (counts 5-11) as well as a count of Internet luring that involved A. (count 4). 
    In addition to the charges involving H. and A., Mr. Saliba was charged with a
    count of possession of child pornography (count 12) and a count of violating a
    non-communication provision in his bail order (count 13).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Mr. Saliba pled guilty to the possession of child pornography
    charge.  He was acquitted on the bail violation charge.  Mr. Saliba was
    convicted on the charges relating to H. and acquitted on the charges relating
    to A.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed concurrent two year sentences on the charges
    arising out of the sexual activity with H, and a two and one-half year
    consecutive sentence on the possession of child pornography charge, resulting
    in a total sentence of four and one-half years.  The trial judge gave Mr.
    Saliba credit for 265 days of pre-trial custody, leaving a net sentence of
    about three years and nine months. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals the acquittals on the charges relating to A. (counts
    4-13).  Mr. Saliba, with the assistance of duty counsel, appeals the
    convictions on the charges relating to the sexual activity with H. (counts 1-3)
    and seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These reasons address the Crown appeal.  I would allow that appeal and
    order a new trial on the counts relating to A.  Mr. Salibas appeals are the
    subject of a separate endorsement.  Those appeals are dismissed.</p>

  <h1>the facts</h1>
  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Relationship with H.</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Saliba, who was 38 years old, met H. through a website called
    Mocospace in December 2008.  That website was limited to persons who stated their
    ages as 18 or over in their website profiles.  In her profile, H. indicated
    that she was 18.  She also provided a picture in which she tried to make
    herself look older than she actually was.  H. was 14.      </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Saliba and H. met very shortly after they connected through the Mocospace
    website.  Mr. Saliba, at H.s invitation, went to H.s home when her parents
    were not there.  They had sexual intercourse.  H. was a willing participant in
    the sexual activity.  H.s father arrived home while Mr. Saliba was still in
    the house.  A physical confrontation occurred and Mr. Saliba left.  There was
    evidence that H.s father made it clear to Mr. Saliba that H. was underage.  Mr.
    Saliba denied being told by H.s father that she was underage.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Saliba testified that he believed H. was 18 years of age.  He based
    this belief on her stated age in her Mocospace profile and on her appearance,
    both in her profile picture and when he met her.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H. and Mr. Saliba carried on a sexual relationship for about nine months
    until September 2009.  According to Mr. Saliba, H. acted as if she were in her
    twenties.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H.
    testified that shortly after she began her relationship with Mr. Saliba, she
    told him that she was 14.  She did this because she thought her father had told
    Mr. Saliba her real age when he found Mr. Saliba and H. in H.s home at the
    time of their first sexual encounter.  Mr. Saliba denied that H. told him she
    was 14, although he conceded that she eventually dropped her age from 18 to 17.</p>
  <h6>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Relationship with A.</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Saliba met A. on the Mocospace website in February 2010, about five or six
    months after he terminated his relationship with H.  A. was 15 years of age but
    stated she was 18 in her profile.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    their initial online communication, A. told Mr. Saliba she was 18.  She said
    she was in high school.  According to Mr. Saliba, she explained that she had
    failed twice.  A. also told Mr. Saliba that she lived at home and did not have
    a drivers licence.  According to Mr. Saliba, there was no discussion about her
    age in their online conversations.  He accepted the age that A. stated in her profile.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.
    and Mr. Saliba met shortly after they first communicated online.  They began a
    relationship that lasted for about two months.  That relationship involved
    sexual activity almost from the outset.  That activity eventually included
    vaginal intercourse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Saliba testified that he never asked A. about her age after they met.  When confronted
    with statements to the police in which he said that A. looked young and that
    he had asked her about her age on several occasions and that she had given
    answers ranging from 17 to 19, Mr. Saliba refused to adopt those statements. 
    In the same statements, he indicated that he had eventually found out that A.
    was 15 turning 16.  It is fair to say that Mr. Salibas evidence, considered
    as a whole, is unclear as to exactly what A. told him about her age.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.
    and Mr. Saliba visited Mr. Salibas friends.  One of those friends testified at
    trial.  This friend testified that, when she first saw A., she thought A. was
    about 13 and was perhaps Mr. Salibas niece.  Mr. Saliba introduced A. as his
    girlfriend.  This witness spoke with A. and eventually came to the view that
    because A. was in grade 12 she was probably about seventeen.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Saliba told A. that he wanted to meet her mother.  A. told Mr. Saliba that her
    mother was aware of, and had no problems with, her relationship with Mr.
    Saliba.  A. indicated a willingness to have Mr. Saliba meet her mother.  In
    fact, A. had not told her mother about the relationship and did not arrange for
    Mr. Saliba to meet her mother.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span

    and A. were both willing participants in the sexual activity.  However, since
    both were under sixteen years of age at the relevant time, they could not
    consent to sexual activity:  see <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,</span></em> s. 150.1(1).  Mr.
    Saliba claimed he believed that both H. and A. were over sixteen.  That belief,
    or, more accurately, a reasonable doubt as to the existence of that belief, combined
    with the complainants willing participation in the sexual activity, could
    afford a defence to the charges only if the accused took all reasonable steps
    to ascertain the age of the complainant:  <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge outlined the principles governing the application of s. 150.1(4). 
    He correctly noted that Mr. Saliba was entitled to be acquitted on the charges
    unless the Crown could show beyond a reasonable doubt that he had not taken all
    reasonable steps to ascertain the true ages of H. and A.  The trial judge
    recognized that a determination of what constituted all reasonable steps
    depended on the circumstances of the particular case and had to be determined
    from the perspective of the reasonable person and not solely by reference to
    the accuseds subjective perception:  <em>R. v. Duran</em>, 2013 ONCA 343, at
    paras. 51-55.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    setting out the principles, the trial judge applied those principles to the
    evidence as it related to the activity with H.  He concluded that the Crown had
    proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Saliba had not taken all reasonable
    steps to ascertain H.s true age before engaging in sexual activity with her.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to the application of s. 150.1(4) to the evidence as it
    related to the steps taken by Mr. Saliba to ascertain A.s age:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Saliba never directly asked A. her age.  As was the case
    with respect to H., the age difference, considerable age difference, between
    these parties required a higher level of inquiry than would otherwise be the
    case.  Having said that, in the final analysis, there is a reasonable doubt, in
    my mind, as to whether all reasonable steps were taken in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, in addition to the computer profile and the picture,
    it is of some significance in my view that Mr. Saliba had made it clear that he
    wanted to meet A.s mother and that she agreed and encouraged him to believe
    that they would meet.  In fact, they did meet by chance, and theres no
    evidence of any adverse reaction from the person he did meet.  <span
class=Underline><i><span style='text-decoration:none'>Once he was told that
    meeting A.s mother was all right and that, in fact, A.s mother was aware of
    the relationship, it seems to me that it would be highly unlikely that Mr.
    Saliba would have considered it acceptable if he actually thought A. was
    underage.</span></i></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><i><span style='text-decoration:none'>There
    was no other real inquiry.</span></i></span>  This is a borderline case, but,
    in the final analysis, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether all reasonable

  <h1>the argument on appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    an appeal from an acquittal, the Crown can raise only questions of law alone:  <em>Criminal
    Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> s. 676(1)(a).  Mr.
    Skerkowski, counsel for the Crown, argues that, on the facts, either undisputed
    or as found by the trial judge, there could be no doubt that the appellant did
    not take all reasonable steps required by s. 150.1(4).  He submits that the
    trial judge erred in law in concluding that the undisputed facts and the facts
    as found by the trial judge could leave him with a doubt as to whether the
    Crown had proved that Mr. Saliba did not take all reasonable steps to ascertain
    A.s true age.  Mr. Skerkowski analogizes this case to a case where the trial
    judge makes all of the findings of fact necessary to convict but nonetheless
    acquits.  In those circumstances, the failure to convict constitutes an error
    in law:  see <em>R. v. Morin</em>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286 at 294; and <em>R. v.
    Davis</em> (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 517, at pp. 519-20 (Ont. C.A.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Webster, for Mr. Saliba, submits that the Crowns appeal does not raise a

    determination that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
    Mr. Saliba had not taken all reasonable steps to determine A.s age is not a
    question of law alone, but rather a determination that the Crown had failed to
    meet its burden on that issue:  see <em>R. v. J.M.H.</em>, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197

  <h1>analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Crown that the trial judge erred in law in his application of s.
    150.1(4).  I characterize that error differently than the Crown does.  I do not
    see this as a case of failing to draw the only available legal conclusion from
    a set of facts, but rather as a case where the trial judge failed to make the
    legal inquiry mandated by s. 150.1(4).  With respect, the trial judge looked to
    and relied on evidence which, while relevant to Mr. Salibas belief as to A.s
    age, could not assist in determining whether he took all reasonable steps to
    ascertain A.s age.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    150.1(4) is not concerned with the accuseds belief as to a complainants age. 
    Indeed, the section assumes that the accused believes that the complainant is
    old enough to give legal consent and requires an inquiry into the basis for
    that belief.  The trial judge did not make that inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    generally applicable criminal law principles, a belief that a person is old
    enough to consent, or, more accurately, a reasonable doubt as to the existence
    of that belief, would be enough to lead to an acquittal, assuming the
    complainant had been a willing participant in the sexual activity.  Parliament,
    however, by enacting s. 150.1(4), has limited the availability of the honest
    belief defence to cases where the accused has taken all reasonable steps to
    ascertain the age of the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    explained in <em>R. v. Dragos</em> (2012), 291 C.C.C. (3d) 350, at paras. 29-33
    (Ont. C.A.), s. 150.1(4) mandates an inquiry akin to a due diligence inquiry. 
    The trier of fact must compare the steps, if any, taken by an accused to
    determine the true age of a complainant with the steps that a reasonable person
    would have taken in those circumstances.  Of course, unlike the more familiar due
    diligence inquiry, the s. 150.1(4) analysis does not place any onus on the accused. 
    The onus is on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that all reasonable
    steps were not taken:  <em>Duran</em>, at para. 54.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have set out the entirety of the relevant part of the trial judges reasons
    above at para. 21.  The trial judge was heavily influenced by the evidence that
    Mr. Saliba wanted to meet A.s mother, was told by A. that her mother was aware
    of and approved of their relationship, and was told by A. that he could meet her
    mother.  The trial judge also relied on the evidence that there was no adverse
    reaction from A.s mother when she eventually met Mr. Saliba.  In the trial
    judges view, all of this evidence was inconsistent with the claim that Mr.
    Saliba actually thought A. was underage.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can accept that most of the evidence referred to by the trial judge was
    relevant to Mr. Salibas belief as to A.s age.  However, none of that evidence
    had any relevance to what steps, if any, Mr. Saliba had taken to ascertain A.s
    age.  Nor is the evidence relevant to the steps that a reasonable person would have
    taken in those circumstances.  With respect, the trial judges analysis stopped
    with a finding of Mr. Salibas state of mind.  The s. 150.1(4) analysis begins
    at that point and looks to the steps taken to confirm the accuracy of the
    accuseds belief as to the complainants age.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    must also disagree with the trial judges finding that the absence of any
    adverse reaction from A.s mother when she met Mr. Saliba was of assistance
    in the s. 150.1(4) inquiry.  Mr. Saliba did not tell A.s mother anything about
    himself other than his first name and certainly made no reference to his
    relationship with A. when he was speaking to A.s mother.  In that
    circumstance, the absence of any adverse reaction from A.s mother had no
    evidentiary value either as it related to Mr. Salibas state of mind or to the
    steps that a reasonable person would have taken to ascertain A.s age.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the trial judge focused on evidence that was relevant to Mr. Salibas belief
    rather than on the steps he had taken to confirm that belief and the steps that
    a reasonable person would have taken to confirm that belief, the trial judge erred
    in law in his s. 150.1(4) analysis.  While I agree that the evidence suggests
    that Mr. Saliba had taken precious few, if any, steps to determine A.s age, this
    is not a case where the court can substitute convictions.  I would order new
    trials on the counts relating to the sexual activity with A. and the count
    alleging Internet luring (counts 4-11).</p>

  <h1 style='page-break-after:auto'>The Evidentiary Point</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also challenges an evidentiary ruling made by the trial judge.  Although
    it is not necessary to address this issue given my conclusion on the first
    ground of appeal, I will do so as it may arise on the retrial.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>At trial, the Crown argued that, in determining
    whether Mr. Saliba took all reasonable steps to ascertain A.s age before
    engaging in sexual activity with her, it was relevant that Mr. Saliba knew that
    he had been previously lied to by H. about her age on the same website.  </span>As
    I understand the argument, the Crown contends that knowledge that a source of
    information had previously proved unreliable as to a persons age is relevant
    to the steps that a reasonable person would take in confirming information
    subsequently received from the same source about another persons age.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    issue was raised and argued at trial as an application to introduce similar
    fact evidence.  This characterization was unfortunate.  In my view, the admissibility
    of the evidence does not engage the complexities of the similar fact analysis. 
    The relevance is the product of the common sense proposition that if a person
    knows that information obtained from a source was inaccurate in the past, that
    knowledge may affect the steps that a reasonable person would take to confirm
    similar information received from the same source on a subsequent occasion. 
    The evidence was admissible for the limited purpose advanced by the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    holding that Mr. Salibas knowledge that H. had lied to him about her age in
    her Mocospace profile was relevant to the reasonable steps necessary to confirm
    the same information provided by A., I do not suggest that this knowledge was
    determinative or even necessarily entitled to significant weight.  The weight
    of the evidence is for the trial judge.  These reasons also should not be taken
    as any comment on the possible admissibility on the charges involving A. of
    other conversations involving H. and Mr. Saliba.  </p>
