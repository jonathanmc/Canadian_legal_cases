  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentence imposed on March 12, 2013 by
    Justice J.E. Allen of the Ontario Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the disposition imposed by Allen J. on March
    12, 2013 of 12 months closed custody and supervision and 12 months probation on
    a charge of sexual interference. For the following reasons the appeal is
    dismissed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel have been very helpful in their submissions on this difficult
    case. The 17-year-old appellant, who had no prior criminal record, committed a
    very serious offence. He gained access to an apartment building lobby, pursued
    the 13-year-old complainant, a complete stranger, grabbed her, groped her
    between her legs and grabbed her breasts. He continued the assault
    notwithstanding the complainant’s screams and attempts to get away.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Extensive material was placed before the trial judge to assist him with
    sentencing the appellant. Because of his very unfortunate antecedents detailed
    in the pre-sentence report, the Gladue report and the reports of Dr. Chretien
    and Dr. Dickey, the appellant presents as a high risk to re-offend generally
    and to re-offend sexually. He suffers from a relatively severe conduct disorder
    that could lead to Antisocial Personality Disorder as an adult. He may well
    suffer from a deviant sexual preference which would cause additional serious
    concern. Due to his intellectual limitations, effective treatment is
    problematic. The evidence strongly supported the view that the appellant
    required residence in a structured living situation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two principal issues raised by appellant’s counsel are the lack of
    credit for pre-sentence custody and the imposition of a sentence that does not
    accord with s. 38 of the <em>Youth Criminal Justice Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, S.C. 2002., c. 1</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the pre-sentence custody, we agree that it would have been helpful
    if the trial judge had explicitly dealt with the issue. That said, we are
    satisfied that this is one of those exceptional cases, as discussed in <em>R.
    v. E.L. </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(2006)</span></em>, 210 O.A.C.
    124 (C.A.), and <em>R. v. N.W.P.</em>, 2008 MBCA 101, 231 Man. R. (2d) 61, in
    which it was open to the trial judge to not give any credit for pre-sentence
    custody. The lengthy comments by the trial judge in his dialogue with counsel
    and his reasons on March 6, 2013 explain why the maximum disposition was
    required, in this unusual case, to protect the public through rehabilitative
    measures in a highly structured setting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are also satisfied that the disposition is consistent with s. 38 of
    the Act. Counsel submits that the trial judge’s candid observation about the
    difficulty in holding this appellant accountable shows that the custodial
    portion of the sentence was imposed solely for the purpose of incapacitation.
    We do not agree for the following reasons. The trial judge explicitly stated
    that he was not imposing sentence for the purpose of incapacitation or general
    deterrence. It is clear that the trial judge was rightly concerned that if the
    appellant did not get proper treatment a time would come when a sentence would
    have to be imposed to segregate the appellant from society. However, that was a
    matter that would occur only if the appellant was sentenced in the future as an
    adult for new serious offences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made it abundantly clear that the disposition he was
    considering was for purposes of rehabilitation. His comments about protection
    of the public must be seen in that context.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 38(1) of the Act provides that the purpose of youth sentencing
    is to hold a young person accountable for an offence through the imposition of
    just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person and that
    promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby
    contributing to the long-term protection of the public. In the course of his
    reasons on March 6, the trial judge made some very strong comments about accountability,
    at one point stating that “holding him accountable in the context of this
    particular case is nonsense”. Counsel submits that accordingly the trial judge
    must have imposed the custodial sentence for reasons other than accountability.
    When the reasons are read as a whole it is apparent that the trial judge’s
    comments were rooted in the appellant’s intellectual limitations and the
    impulsiveness of the act. The sentence imposed did attempt to hold the
    appellant accountable for his actions in the sense discussed in <em>R. v.
    B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>2006
    SCC 27, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 941, at para. 33, to the extent possible, given the
    appellant’s limitations. It is doubtful that any lesser disposition would have been
    effective in holding the appellant accountable while at the same time promoting
    his rehabilitation and reintegration into society as required by s. 38(1) of
    the Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in principle in
    failing to consider alternatives such as a group home or custody at the Syl
    Apps facility. However, the trial judge did consider these alternatives and
    rejected them for cogent reasons. The group home option would not be sufficient
    after the appellant turned 18, which was to occur shortly. As to Syl Apps, the
    sentencing had already been adjourned once to get more information. Through his
    counsel, the appellant opposed a further adjournment and provided reasons why
    the Hope Manor facility was preferable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while leave to appeal is granted, the appeal from sentence is dismissed.</p>
