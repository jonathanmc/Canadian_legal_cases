  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a)   by
    overemphasizing the <em>Gladue</em> principles; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b)  by failing

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant requested a sentence in the range of two to
    three years. While the appellant now submits that the appropriate sentence is
    in the range of five to six years, in light of its position at trial, the
    appellant seeks a sentence of three years.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the offence, the victim was 14 years of age.  She was a close
    friend of the respondents daughter whom she had known since grade four.  The
    victim was being bullied at school.  She began to attend at the respondents
    home on a daily basis.  The respondent, who was 40 years old at the time, told
    her that he too had been bullied and could help her deal with it.  The two
    began to exchange text messages.  After a few months, the respondent began
    telling the victim that his sex life with his wife was unsatisfactory.  He invited
    the victim to engage in his sexual fantasies.  When the victim was
    unresponsive, he threatened to kill himself. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the victim initially resisted the appellants advances, he
    persisted and the victim began to feel that she was in a relationship with him. 
    She would regularly meet him in his truck before and after school.  He
    digitally penetrated the victim without her consent and, after this the
    respondent routinely digitally penetrated the victim.  On one occasion, he had
    sexual intercourse with her without using a condom.  He also penetrated her
    with a vibrator and placed a ball gag in her mouth.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police were contacted when the victims father discovered some of
    the text messages on the victims cell phone.  By this time, the respondent and
    the victim would communicate upwards of 600 times per day.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent pled guilty to the offence of sexual interference.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent obtained a secondary school diploma.  He has worked as a
    fabricator for the past 12 years. He has no prior criminal record.  He has been
    married for many years and has three children.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent and his mother are members of the Kettle and Stony Point
    First Nation.  She attended a public off-reserve school where she was subject
    to racism.  The respondents father is of German descent.  The respondents
    parents have been married for over 45 years and continue to live in London
    where they raised the respondent and his sister.  They owned and successfully operated
    a variety store and a Dairy Queen there.  They worked hard and with substantial
    savings, were able to retire when the respondent was 14 years old.  The
    respondent was disciplined by his father through corporal punishment.  The
    respondent felt that his parents doted on his sister and that he was unloved.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent did not grow up in an Aboriginal community.  His father was a
    disciplinarian who disapproved of any Aboriginal cultural involvement or
    practices within their home.  Accordingly, the respondents knowledge of, and
    participation in, Aboriginal culture is limited.  The respondent asserted that
    his only connection to Aboriginal culture was through regular visits with his
    maternal grandparents who resided on the reserve.  His grandfather died when he
    was 13 and his grandmother died when he was 30.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    impact of the offence on the victim and her family has been enormous.  She had
    previously been an A student.  Her marks fell.  She switched schools and lost
    most of her friends. She commenced self-cutting and was on suicide watch.  She
    suffers frequent panic attacks and has been put on anti-depressants. She has
    been accused of lying about the offence.  Her father admonishes himself for
    having failed to protect her.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>Grounds of Appeal</p>
  <h4 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the sentencing judge err in the <i>Gladue </i>analysis by
    overemphasizing factors that had limited application to this particular
    accused?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The respondent
    accepts that the sentencing judge imposed a lesser sentence than he would have
    if not for the </span></strong><em>Gladue</em><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'> principles. He submits that there is no way of quantifying the
    differential and submits that the overall sentence was nonetheless fit.</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the sentencing judge did correctly state the <em>Gladue</em> principles, he
    failed to tie them in some way to the offender and the offence and in so
    doing, underemphasized the respondents moral culpability for this offence.  While
    an Aboriginal offender need not establish a direct causal link between his
    circumstances and the offence, the <em>Gladue</em> factors need to be tied in
    some way to the offender and the offence (<em>R. v. Ipeelee</em>, 2012 SCC 13,
    [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433 at para. 83.  See also <em>R. v. Gladue</em>, [1999] 1
    S.C.R. 688).  The rationale for <em>Gladue</em> is that many Aboriginal
    offenders come from situations of social and economic deprivation with few
    opportunities for positive development and these circumstances may diminish
    their moral culpability (<em>R. v. Ipeelee</em>, at para. 73).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case the respondents circumstances did not diminish his moral
    culpability.  As the <em>Gladue</em> report indicated, the respondents
    knowledge of, and participation in, his Aboriginal culture was limited. He grew
    up off-reserve and was raised by parents who have been married for over 45
    years and who ran a successful business. There was no suggestion of any
    residential school history within his mothers family of origin.  The
    respondent never attended a residential school and there is no evidence he
    experienced any sexual abuse, discrimination, or forced displacement.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, the judges emphasis on addressing the impact of residential
    schools, displacement from communities, and higher incidents of suicide,
    substance abuse and incarceration among Aboriginal people was misplaced in this
    case. There was nothing in the <em>Gladue </em>report that would warrant a
    sentence outside the normal range.</p>
  <h4 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does the sentence imposed fail to give proper effect to denunciation and
    deterrence and result in a sentence outside the range and that is manifestly
    unfit?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quite
    apart from the foregoing, the sentencing judge failed to appreciate the gravity
    of the offence and the culpability of the offender. This was an exploitative,
    repeated and demeaning series of sexual assaults against a vulnerable 14
    year-old by a person in a position of trust. An eight month sentence cannot
    adequately reflect the principles of denunciation and deterrence. The judge
    appears to have treated the childs acquiescence as a mitigating factor; he
    said that she had not been raped. However, a childs willing participation is
    not a mitigating factor in circumstances where the respondent made the victim
    feel that she was in a relationship with him (<em>R. v. P.M.</em> (2002), 155
    O.A.C. 242 (C.A.)). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mid-to-upper
    single digit penitentiary sentences are appropriate where an adult in a
    position of trust sexually abuses a young child on a regular basis over a
    substantial period of time (<em>R. v. D.D.</em><i> </i>(2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788
    (C.A.), at para. 44).  This range may apply even to a single instance of sexual
    abuse (<em>R. v. Woodward</em>, 2011 ONCA 610, 284 O.A.C. 151 (C.A.)).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent groomed the victim and used emotional blackmail.  Not realizing that
    she was being manipulated by the offender, the complainant was seduced into
    thinking that she was in a relationship with him. This was not an isolated
    incident of sexual interference.  The first instances were forced. The
    respondent used a vibrator and a ball gag without the victims consent. The abuse
    escalated over time to include one incident of full unprotected intercourse
    thereby exposing the victim to the possibility of an unwanted pregnancy and the
    risk of sexually transmitted disease.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is of paramount importance that children be protected from seducers and  predators
    through sentences that emphasize the principles of denunciation and deterrence.

    the circumstances, a three year sentence of incarceration less time spent in
    post-conviction custody is fit and appropriate.  We calculate time spent as
    amounting to 162 days (June 6, 2013  November 14, 2013).  In giving this
    sentence, we are not departing from the <em>R. v. D.D.</em> range but are
    giving effect to the range of sentence sought by the appellant.  The ancillary
    orders remain in place.</p>

    trial varied in accordance with these reasons. </p>
