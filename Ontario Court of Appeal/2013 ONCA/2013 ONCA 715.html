    the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 1, 2012, with reasons reported at
    2012 ONSC 685.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeader><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Simmons
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant father appeals from an order requiring that he pay lump
    sum child support to the respondent mother. The issues on appeal concern the
    motion judge’s findings that the father, who had been experiencing mental
    health problems, was capable of returning to work and of earning an income
    equal to the amounts of capital the motion judge found he had been spending
    annually.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After several years of litigation, the father and the mother resolved various
    issues in matrimonial proceedings between them by way of a consent order dated
    May 7, 2007. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the consent order, the father began experiencing mental health
    problems and his licence to practise psychiatry was suspended. Among other
    things, the consent order: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>terminated the father’s obligation to pay child support under an interim
    order; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>fixed the father’s child support obligation for the period from January
    1, 2007 to September 1, 2007 at nil; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>established
    a mechanism for reviewing the father’s child support obligations in the future. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, the consent order required that the father place $200,000 from
    his share of the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home in trust and provided
    that those funds would be returned to him if he satisfied his child support
    obligations between September 1, 2007 and September 1, 2010. If the father did
    not satisfy his child support obligations, the mother could apply for payments
    from the funds held in trust as child support.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As of September 1, 2010, the father’s licence to practice medicine had
    not been reinstated. However, during the period between January 1, 2008 and January
    1, 2012, he received monies totalling about $800,000 – consisting of some capital;
    some income (including RRSP income); the proceeds of a motor vehicle accident
    settlement, and CPP disability payments. The father did not disclose these
    receipts to the mother and paid no child support during this period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a motion by the father for the return of the $200,000 placed in trust,
    the motion judge concluded that the father had not satisfied his child support
    obligations between September 1, 2007 and September 1, 2010. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the motion judge accepted that the father had an illness, she
    was “not satisfied he is totally disabled and the victim of his illness.”
    Instead, the motion judge found that the father had chosen not to follow any
    active treatment plan and she accepted the mother’s submission that the father
    could have gotten better.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account of the father’s long history of failing to pay support
    orders, the motion judge concluded that a lump sum award of child support was
    appropriate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, after noting that the father had chosen to live off capital
    of about $80,000 per year, the motion judge found that he could probably return
    to work and earn at least that amount. Holding that the $80,000 figure should
    be grossed up for income tax, she imputed to the father a before tax income of $118,000.
    Based on her estimate that child support arrears and future child support using
    that income would exceed $200,000 by a significant amount, the motion judge
    awarded the balance<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> of the trust fund to the mother and dismissed all other claims for relief. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father raises two main issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge err by artificially conflating capital with income
    for child support purposes?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the motion judge err by imputing employment income to the father
    when he is under a disability and cannot work?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the first issue, the father submits that, in stating that the
    father had chosen to live off capital of about $80,000 per year, the motion
    judge failed to distinguish between income and capital and improperly imputed
    income to him based largely on his capital expenditures. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that in calculating the figure of $80,000 per year, the motion judge
    failed to distinguish between income and capital receipts.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> 
    I also agree that it is not generally appropriate to impute income to a spouse for
    child support purposes on the basis of the spouse’s expenditure of
    non-recurring capital receipts that are not treated as income for income tax
    purposes.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, I do not consider the motion judge’s reference to the father living off
    capital of $80,000 per year as being determinative of the appeal. As I read the
    motion judge’s reasons, she imputed an $80,000 annual income to the father, not
    because she found he had been living on capital of $80,000 per year and treated
    his capital as the equivalent of income, but rather because she found he could
    get better, return to work and earn an annual after tax income of at least
    $80,000. The father’s second issue addresses these core findings. I will
    therefore focus on the father’s second issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the motion judge erred in rejecting,
    without giving reasons, the father’s medical evidence concerning the nature of
    his illness and its impact on his ability to work. Further, on my review of the
    record, it does not support the motion judge’s findings that the father could
    get better, return to work and generate an after tax income of at least $80,000
    per year and that he failed to follow an active treatment plan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    conclusions raise the following additional issues: i) what is the father’s annual
    income for child support purposes?;  ii) is the father entitled to the return
    of the balance of the funds held in trust?; and iii) what are the father’s retroactive
    and ongoing child support obligations? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would set aside the motion judge’s order and award past and
    future child support based on income figures I have determined for the father. Given
    that funds are being held in trust to satisfy child support payments, I would
    not make an order for lump sum ongoing child support. Instead, I would direct
    that the ongoing child support payments I have calculated be made on an annual
    basis from the trust fund. I would also direct that the father make ongoing
    disclosure to the mother of his health situation and his income. </p>

  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Parties</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties were married in 1994 and separated in 2002. They have two children, a
    daughter born in 1995 (now 18 years old) and a son born in 1998 (now 15 years
    old). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the motion judge, prior to the separation, the parties enjoyed a lavish
    lifestyle. They lived in a two million dollar home and the children attended
    private school. The father was a successful psychiatrist earning more than
    $300,000 per year.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the separation, the children continued to live with their mother. At least by
    the time of the consent order, the mother was operating a lighting store. In
    2011, she purchased a home for $678,000 that is subject to a $200,000 mortgage.
    Apart from this, the record contains little information about the mother’s
    current financial situation.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father has since remarried. Until about mid to late 2011, he lived in a home
    registered in his new wife’s name that was purchased for $391,000 in 2008 with
    his money. Since about mid to late 2011, the father has lived, at least
    intermittently, in a long-term care facility. I will say more about the
    father’s current financial situation later in these reasons.</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Consent Order</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the father’s motion for the return of the monies held in trust was made
    pursuant to the consent order, I will review the relevant provisions of the
    order in some detail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    10 of the consent order terminated the father’s support obligation under an interim
    order, acknowledged his inability to work and stipulated that he would have no
    obligation to pay support from January 1, 2007, to August 31, 2007:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>10. THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES THAT the [father’s]
    obligation to pay interim child support pursuant to paragraphs 8, 11 and 12 of
    the Interim Order of Van Melle, J., dated February 26, 2003, is terminated.
    Arrears are hereby fixed at $0.00 as any amounts owing are satisfied with the
    payment to the [mother] in paragraph 13(c) of this Order. The [father] is
    currently unable to work and his current child support obligation for the
    period January 1, 2007 to August 31, 2007, is therefore nil.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraphs
    11 and 13 of the consent order required a solicitor to hold $200,000 from the
    father’s share of the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home in trust; to
    invest the funds in short term interest bearing securities; and to pay any
    interest to the father. The funds were not to be disbursed without the written
    consent of both parties or further court order, except in the event of the
    father’s death – in which case the funds were to be paid to the mother as a
    fund for the future support of the children. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    11 of the consent order also specified that the father would be entitled to the
    return of the $200,000 if he satisfied his child support obligations between
    September 1, 2007 and September 1, 2010 – but that the mother could apply for
    payments from the fund on account of child support if he did not:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the [father], after three years, has met his child support
    obligations from September 1, 2007 to September 1, 2010, and is then meeting
    his reasonable child support obligations, such funds, or the balance then
    remaining, shall be returned to him. In the interim, if the [father] has failed
    to meet his reasonable child support obligations, the [mother] may apply to the
    Court for an Order directing payment of such funds, at any time, for child
    support to cover any period following September 1, 2007, or costs awarded to
    her in any future litigation with the [father]. After September 1, 2010, if any
    part of the fund remains in trust, the [mother] may apply to the Court for an
    Order directing payment of such funds, at any time, for child support, or costs
    awarded to her in any future litigation with [the father] relating to the fund.
    In the event of a dispute in regard to the release of such funds, either party

    12 of the consent order is important because it creates a review mechanism for
    the father’s child support obligations after September 1, 2007 and specifies
    the parties’ disclosure obligations:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>12. THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES THAT at any time after
    September 1, 2007, and once per year thereafter, either party may request in
    writing to review the child support arrangements, including the table amount
    and amounts then incurred for extraordinary expenses. Within 30 days of the
    making of such request and upon receipt of such a request, the party shall
    disclose the documents required in Section 21 of the <em>Child Support Guidelines</em>,
    information about the amount incurred for the extraordinary expenses for the
    previous period, current information about the children’s extraordinary
    expenses and any other information needed to review child support. The
    [father’s] disclosure obligation will include a year to date summary, to the
    then most recent month end, of his OHIP billings as well as all other income.
    The [mother’s] disclosure obligation will include production of Watts Current
    Inc. Financial Statements to the most recent fiscal year end, and evidence of
    revenue and expenses since the most recent fiscal year end Financial Statement.
    The parties will thereafter attempt to resolve the issue but if they are
    unable, either party is at liberty to bring a Motion before the Court for the
    determination of child support.</p>

    exhibits consist primarily of a series of medical reports and progress notes
    authored by the father’s psychiatrist. It is not clear on what basis these
    reports and progress notes were admitted into evidence. However, no issue was
    raised on appeal concerning the propriety of their admission and, in their

    whom he described as his psychiatrist. In the October 6, 2010 letter, Dr. Ofosu
    said that the father had been under his care at a hospital since July 29, 2010;
    that the father suffers from bipolar disorder; and that the father “will not be

    different psychiatrists “with a focus on treatment from Dr. Hoffman of
    Sunnybrook Hospital.” She noted that the father’s material does not mention Dr.
    Hoffman and does not disclose what course of treatment, if any, the father had
    been following. She expressed the view that “[m]any patients with bipolar
    disorder are able to lead normal lives, and work productively, by following a
    prescribed medication regime.” She observed that the father’s material did not
    disclose his proposed treatment plan nor indicate whether he was following it.</p>

    returned to the care of Dr. Turner. The father said that, except when he was an
    in-patient in hospital, Dr. Turner had been his treating psychiatrist since
    2007; that Dr. Turner had provided an extensive report to the court in 2007;

    his care since he first saw the father in the emergency room of a hospital on
    January 5, 2007 (which was a few months prior to the May 2007 consent order).
    The father presented in an agitated state with suicidal ideation, symptoms of
    depression and emotional upset. He was initially admitted to the in-patient
    psychiatric unit of the hospital. Following the father’s discharge from the
    hospital, Dr. Turner continued to see him as an office patient on what Dr.
    Turner described as regular intervals – however, Dr. Turner also noted that the

    chances for improvement, he eventually concluded that any significant

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in a January 2007 Consultation Report, Dr. Turner described the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in an April 2007 Medical-Legal Report, Dr. Turner described the

    reaction”; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>by September 2007, Dr. Turner was describing the father as having
    “Major Depression, marked severity” – in particular, Dr. Turner noted that at
    their August 20, 2007 session, the father had more severe psychiatric symptoms
    – including depression and suicidal thoughts and difficulty in attention and
    concentration – and in addition the father appeared to be developing cognitive
    difficulties, impairment of memory and inappropriateness; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>on November 29, 2007, while saying that the father had been
    co-operative with prescribed psychiatric treatments and was improving, Dr.
    Turner described the father as suffering from: moderate to severe psychiatric
    symptoms that caused significant anxiety and distress, and at times contributes
    to inappropriate behaviours, particularly when he becomes depressed and
    suicidal.” Dr. Turner continued to diagnose the father with “Major Depression,
    marked severity” and described prior diagnoses of Bipolar Mood disorder and
    Narcissistic Personality Disorder as “deferred”;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in a December 12, 2007 progress note, Dr. Turner said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>“[The father] remains chronically para-suicidal. There is a
    risk that he may complete suicide, which remains chronic and unchanged from before.
    I do not think much else can be done other than being as supportive as possible
    and optimizing his various medications … and continuing to see him as regularly
    as possible. There is no value in repeated certification and involuntary
    commitments. This may be harmful in increasing his sense of being a victim and
    be traumatizing him further”;</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in June 2008, Dr. Turner noted that although the father had been
    somewhat more stable in the last six months, his “psychiatric condition was
    reemerging and that he presented with similar clinical symptoms of depression,
    hopelessness, suicidality and thought disorder” as had been present in the
    past. Dr. Turner identified a treatment plan impasse as between himself and a
    psychologist the father had been seeing and noted that the father would have to
    decide what plan he wanted to go with as he could not continue with both
    practitioners in the circumstances. Following this visit, Dr. Turner did not
    see the father again until March 2009, at which time the father resumed his

    report to CPPD:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>When I saw [the father] originally in the emergency department
    … he was in an acute state of distress with unstable symptoms of depression and
    episodic suicidal plans and gestures. Since that time I have continued to
    follow [the father] for regular follow up visits in my office. At the time of
    this writing he has continued to experience unstable mood symptoms particularly
    episodes of depression, despondency and expressed suicidal ideation. He has
    been tried on various mood stabilizers, antidepressants and mood stimulants…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Current mental status examination indicated the presence of
    unstable mood symptoms as noted above. He has somewhat reduced energy. His
    concentration and attention was rated as very poor. He was inconsistent in
    giving his history, has difficulty in understanding complex issues, and has the
    tendency to perseverate and repeat himself… He gets periods of partial mood
    elevation in conjunction with poor judgment and impulsive behaviours including
    inappropriate spending if given the opportunity.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>… I understand that [the father] has not been working sometime
    prior to my first contact with him in January of 2007. His medical license has
    been under suspension for the same period of time. At one point there was the
    question of whether he could potentially be reinstated but given the
    continuation of his current symptoms I do not see any chance of that happening
    at this time.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[The father] self reported that he is doing some counselling
    with clients at his current wife’s office, which helps him to feel better about
    himself but is limited to a few hours each week. Notwithstanding that, I do
    think that [the father] is clearly totally disabled from his former profession
    and from any competitive alternative employment related to the severity of his
    continuing psychiatric symptoms and cognitive symptoms. I do not foresee any
    significant improvement in his psychiatric symptoms given my experience with
    his treatment over the last 3 years.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am continuing to follow [the father] as an outpatient in my
    office. He has generally been very compliant with his attendance at the office…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>subsequent progress notes include the following observations by
    Dr. Turner: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>April 30, 2010 – [the father] continues to present as somewhat
    agitated. At times his conversation appeared slightly bizarre, disjointed and
    inappropriate … It is not clear to me … whether [his] lack of insight and
    inappropriateness is representative of fairly severe attention deficit symptoms
    … and he may have some degree of thought disorder related to bipolar features,
    or alternatively that this is representative of a developing organic brain
    syndrome;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>January 7, 2011: [the father] remains unchanged essentially
    with some mood lability, talking inappropriately of events past particularly
    owing $18,000 a month to the FRO, some suicidal thoughts, planning for his
    funeral and getting ready to organize his funeral plots and arrangements</p>
  <p class=CQuote>April 15, 2011: [the father] overall continues to show
    significant thought disorder, thought disorganization and inappropriateness …
    He continues to be very stressed out. He has had frequent hospital visits and
    his overall functional rating is GAF of 50 or less … Certainly I cannot see
    [the father] ever returning to work at present with what appears to be a
    somewhat deteriorating course…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>June 10, 2011: In the office [the father] continues to show
    significant thought disorganization and inappropriateness … At this time I see
    no chance of [the father] working either in his original profession as a
    psychiatrist or in any other profession because I continue to have serious
    concerns about his prognosis due to his deteriorating clinical course
    currently.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Turner’s reports also note that, following a ten-day hospitalization in January
    2010, the father was in a residential placement for an unspecified period,
    until a decision was reached on how to best manage the father’s current
    situation.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[18]</span></span></span></a> They also suggest, based on the father’s self-reporting, that subsequently, in
    July 2010, the father was hospitalized for about four months. It was this
    hospitalization that led to Dr. Ofosu’s handwritten report. However, as I have
    noted in a footnote above, the OHIP records suggest a two-month hospitalization
    from June to early August 2010. According to Dr. Turner’s progress notes, after
    the father returned home from hospital, his new wife arranged for him to be
    supervised while she was working either through attendance at a senior’s centre
    or by a hired supervisor. In his July 29, 2011 progress note, Dr. Turner
    expressed concern about whether the father was developing a degree of dementia. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    in his August 29, 2011 progress note, Dr. Turner noted that the father had been
    on a respite placement for five days and was to go to a similar placement for a
    further five days. He described the father’s mental state as having worsened
    overall compared to when he first saw the father in January 2007. He said,
    “[c]ertainly there has been an increase in his bizarreness, his obsessive
    ruminations and disorganization of thought. He requires frequent supervision of
    his activities of daily living now.” In a September 2, 2011 progress note, Dr.
    Turner noted that the father was asked to leave the respite program because he
    was too agitated and restless and required more supervision than the program could
    provide.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Turner’s final progress note in the record is dated December 9, 2011. In it, he
    states that the father was continuing in respite treatment on a semi-permanent
    basis. He described the father as having “delusional preoccupation” and a
    tendency to be “disjointed and tangential” in his conversation.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Discharge
    summaries</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    attachments to Dr. Turner’s Summary Report also include two discharge summaries
    from other psychiatrists relating to hospital visits by the father. I set these
    out in detail because the motion judge relied heavily on their contents.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first discharge summary was prepared by Dr. Gagan Gaind. It is dated May 21,
    2007, and relates to a hospitalization from May 8, 2007, to May 16, 2007. Dr.
    Gaind discharge diagnosis was:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis I: malingering</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis II: narcissistic personality disorder</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his report, Dr. Gaind explained that his diagnosis of malingering arose from
    the circumstances around the father’s admission to hospital. Prior to being
    admitted to the hospital, the father was apparently charged with mischief for
    pulling a fire alarm at a hotel. After he was charged, he apparently told the
    police that he had been mugged in a garage and that he had injected himself
    with potassium chloride earlier in the day. In Dr. Gaind’s view, the father
    pulled the fire alarm because he was angry with the hotel staff and concocted
    these stories in order to be taken for a psychiatric assessment rather than
    jail. In his view, that conduct fulfilled the criteria for malingering. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gaind also described the father’s narcissistic personality disorder as being
    severe and a problem that would make it difficult for him to get any help:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Everything that [hospital staff] observed … pointed very much
    to a severe narcissistic personality disorder who had decompensated
    increasingly since his marriage broke up five years ago. It was clear that in
    many ways he is the architect of his own misfortune in the various things he
    has done and the lies he has told lead him to greater and greater ruin. It was
    also clear that he had a great deal of difficulty engaging in any meaningful
    therapy with anyone and was simply going from person to person until perhaps he
    hears what he wants to hear … However, the larger picture does suggest a
    narcissistic personality disorder in quite an advanced stage of decompensation.
    Whether he has bipolar disorder type I or type II or attention deficit
    disorder, I cannot say for sure, but my general impression would be that his
    personality disorder explains his behaviours. Unfortunately, this personality
    includes a very marked tendency towards lying and exaggeration, and this will
    make it very difficult for [the father] to get any meaningful help.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second discharge summary was prepared by Dr. Janet Patterson. It is dated July
    20, 2011, and relates to a hospitalization on June 30, 2011. Dr. Patterson also
    diagnosed the father on Axis I as malingering and on Axis II as narcissistic
    personality disorder. Following “an interview [with the father] that was quite
    difficult to sort out”, Dr. Patterson spoke to the father’s new wife who
    explained that the father called the police and told them he tried to kill
    himself because she had gotten angry with him. Concerning the father’s mental
    status, Dr. Patterson said, “there is no current suicidal ideation or evidence
    of mood disorder or psychosis.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Turner’s progress notes include a reference to one other hospital discharge
    summary, but that summary was not included as one of the attachments to his
    Summary Report. The discharge summary relates to a hospitalization from January
    10 to 20, 2010. In a progress note dated February 5, 2010, Dr. Turner describes
    the discharge summary as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I did review the extensive report produced by Dr. Adam and she
    did not really have any new findings. She did comment on his inconsistency of
    presentation, felt him to be possibly malingering and have behavioural and
    personality disorder features. She did not identify any of the underlying
    possible mood disorder features or ADHD features.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge relied on excerpts from some of these discharge summaries
    indicating that the father is a malingerer and a compulsive liar, as well as
    medical records indicating that the father had consulted with multiple
    psychiatrists, to reach her conclusion that the father could return to work.
    However, in doing so, the motion judge did not refer to the indications in the
    material that these characteristics were part of the father’s illness, nor did
    she consider that no report contained an opinion indicating that the father
    could return to work. I will return to these issues in the analysis section of
    these reasons. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion judge’s reasons</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching her conclusion that the father should pay the balance of the trust
    fund to the mother as lump sum child support, the motion judge took account of
    several factors:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the father had a history of non-payment of child support both in
    relation to his two children of this marriage and a child of a prior marriage;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the father had been using capital as opposed to income to support
    his lifestyle since 2007 but had not paid any child support or s. 7 expenses
    for the benefit of the two children during that period;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the father failed to meet his child support obligations between
    September 1, 2007 and September 1, 2010;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although the father had an illness, he had been diagnosed as malingering,
    as having a narcissistic  personality and as a habitual liar;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the father had made repeated false statements that he was paying
    $18,000 per month in child support;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>rather than following an active treatment plan as he had been
    expected to do at the time of the consent order, the father had chosen not to
    do so – instead, he chose to “doctor-shop”. In this regard, the motion judge
    noted that, as a psychiatrist, the father knew the system and that he had
    consulted 209 different doctors between April 2004 and June 2011. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the following key passages of her reasons the motion judge concluded that the
    father could get better and that he was capable of earning an income equal to
    what he had been spending in capital, which would translate into a before-tax
    income of $118,000 per year:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am satisfied that [the father] has an illness. I am not
    satisfied that he is totally disabled and the victim of his illness.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The respondent father is a chronic liar. His doctors have
    diagnosed him as a “habitual liar”. (See the medical reports dated August 20,
    2007 December 30, 2007; August 7, 2009, April 30, 2010 and January 7, 2011.)<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[19]</span></span></span></a> He makes repeated false statements such as:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>–he pays $18,000/month child
    support to FRO</p>
  <p class=CQuote>–his father and uncles all
    committed suicide</p>
  <p class=CQuote>–the judge ordered $400,000.00 held
    in trust in case he killed himself</p>
  <p class=CQuote>He has been diagnosed as:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1) malingering</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) dramatic</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) a narcissistic personality</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) having a propensity towards
    lying disorder.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Dr. Gaind, M.D., described [the father] in 2007 as “the
    architect of his own misfortunes”:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>“It was clear that in many ways, he is the architect of his
    own misfortune and the various things he has done and the lies he has told lead
    him to greater and greater ruin. It is also clear that he had a great deal of
    difficulty engaging in any meaningful therapy with anyone and was simply going
    from person to person until perhaps he hears what he wants to hear…”</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(from the report of Dr. Gaind, M.D., dated May 17, 2007).</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The [father’s] diagnosis on discharge was:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis I: malingering</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis II: narcissistic personality
    disorder</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is clear from the evidence that the respondent father has
    chosen not to follow any ‘active treatment’ plan. He has gone from place to
    place to ‘doctor shop’.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As a psychiatrist, [the father] knows “the system”. The
    evidence before this court shows that [the father] saw 209 <span
class=Underline>different</span> doctors from April 2004 to June 2011 (OHIP
    records) in various locations all across southern Ontario.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Is he ill? Yes, he is ill.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Is he able to get better? I agree with [the wife’s] counsel
    that on the balance of probabilities [the father] could get better except he
    has chosen to focus on not paying child support and, as a result, his illness
    has taken on a life of its own. He has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid
    paying child support to [the mother].</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This is an exceptional case. For all of the above reasons, I am
    content to impute income to [the father] in the amount of $80,000.00 This is a
    far cry from the $300,000.00 – $600,000.00 that he claims that he earned prior
    to the separation. The $80,000 (before taxes) is the approximate amount of
    capital that he has chosen to live on. I believe that if the respondent father
    would accept his responsibility to pay child support he could probably (balance
    of) return to work and earn at least $80,000.00/year. This amount then must be
    grossed up for tax – being approximately $118,000.00/year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using
    an annual income of $118,000, the motion judge went on to estimate the father’s
    total past and future child support obligation at $281,370 calculated as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>$97,534 on account of child support arrears from August 2007 to
    January 2012;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>$133,836 on account of future child support (the children were 16
    and 13 years of age at the time of the motion. The motion judge assumed five
    additional years of child support for two children, and three additional years
    of child support for one child); </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>$60,000 on account of the father’s share of post-secondary
    education expenses. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    noting that her estimate of $281,370 provided nothing for retroactive s. 7
    expenses, the motion judge concluded that a lump sum award for child support
    equivalent to the balance of the trust fund would be appropriate.</p>

    her endorsement, the motion judge accepted that the father had an illness. She did
    not specify what illness and did not explain the chain of reasoning that led to
    her finding that he could get better, return to work and generate an after tax
    income of $80,000 per year. On my reading of her reasons, these findings appear
    to be based on the evidence that the father had been diagnosed as a habitual
    liar, as a malingerer and as having a narcissistic personality disorder along
    with her conclusion that the father failed to follow an  “active treatment”
    plan. In addition, she relied on findings that the father had intentionally
    evaded child support obligations in the past, that he was focused on not paying

    The first error was rejecting, without giving reasons, the father’s medical
    evidence concerning the nature of his illness and its impact on his ability to
    work. The second error was making findings – that the father could get better,
    return to work and earn an after tax income of $80,000 per year, and that he failed
    to follow an active treatment plan – that are not supported by the record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    motion judge’s errors require that this court set aside both her rejection of
    the father’s medical evidence, and her central findings: that the father could
    get better, return to work and earn an after tax income of $80,000 and that he
    failed to follow an active treatment plan. However, because of the costs that
    would be involved in remitting this matter to the Superior Court, I consider
    this to be an appropriate case in which to make the necessary findings to
    dispose of this matter on the merits.</p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(a) The
    motion judge failed to give reasons for rejecting Dr. Turner’s medical evidence
    concerning the nature of the father’s illness and its impact on the father’s
    ability to return to work</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    characterizing the father’s illness as essentially malingering and narcissistic
    personality disorder and in holding that the father could get better and return
    to work, the motion judge implicitly rejected Dr. Turner’s evidence opining
    that the father’s illness is of a broader character and that, because of this
    illness, the father is disabled from working as a psychiatrist or at any form
    of competitive alternative employment. In doing so, the motion judge relied on
    evidence that was either dated or that was of a very limited character – and
    she did so without explaining why. In the circumstances of this case, in my
    view, the motion judge’s failure to give reasons for rejecting these aspects of
    Dr. Turner’s evidence constitutes reversible error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the motion judge relied heavily on Dr. Gaind’s discharge summary,
    which is dated May 21, 2007, and which relates to a hospitalization earlier
    that month. Given that the motion was heard in early 2012, Dr. Gaind’s evidence
    was significantly dated. Moreover, subsequent reports by Dr. Turner describe
    the diagnoses of narcissistic personality disorder and possible bi-polar
    disorder referred to by Dr. Gaind as “deferred” and proffer alternate diagnoses
    – including Mood Disorder [Not Otherwise Specified] and ADHD Traits. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s conclusions about the nature of the father’s illness are also
    consistent with evidence provided in discharge summaries prepared by Dr. Adam
    and Dr. Patterson. However, the evidence provided by these discharge summaries
    was of a limited character. In one of his progress notes, Dr. Turner gave a
    very brief account of Dr. Adam’s 2010 discharge summary without reproducing it.
    Dr. Patterson’s discharge summary related to a one-day hospitalization. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast to the evidence relied on by the motion judge, Dr. Turner’s evidence
    provides far more extensive and detailed observations of the course of the
    father’s illness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Dr. Turner’s opinions and progress notes are premised, to a certain extent, on
    self-reports by the father and reports by his new wife, Dr. Turner’s reports
    and progress notes also include Dr. Turner’s observations of the father’s state
    of mind over a lengthy course of treatment. Dr. Turner’s first-hand
    observations support his conclusions that the father does and has suffered from
    a psychiatric illness for a considerable period of time and that, despite Dr.
    Turner’s efforts, the father’s condition had not improved. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the nature of Dr. Turner’s evidence – evidence arising from first hand observations
    made over a lengthy period of time – in contrast to the nature of the evidence
    relied on by the motion judge – significantly dated evidence and evidence of a
    limited character – no obvious explanation arises from the record for rejecting
    the evidence of Dr. Turner and relying instead on the evidence of Drs. Gaind,
    Adam and Patterson. If the motion judge had a basis for rejecting the evidence
    provided by Dr. Turner’s ongoing observations, in my view, it was necessary
    that she state it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even if the motion judge’s failure to give reasons for rejecting Dr. Turner’s
    evidence does not constitute reversible error, on my review of the record, it
    contains no evidence capable of supporting the motion judge’s finding, premised
    on her more limited characterization of the father’s illness, that the father
    could get better, return to work and generate an annual after tax income of
    $80,000. I will turn to that issue in the next section. </p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(b) The motion
    judge made findings that are not supported by the record</h5>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='line-height:

    evidence that the father could get better, return to work and generate an after

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming,
    as the motion judge seems to have found, that the father’s illness is
    restricted to malingering and narcissistic personality disorder, the motion
    judge referred to no medical evidence that would support her finding that the
    father could get better and return to a form of work that would allow him to
    generate an after tax annual income of $80,000 – a level of income that implies
    some level of professional or equivalent competency. On my review of the
    record, there is no such evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only evidence that addressed the severity of and prognosis for this limited
    understanding of the father’s illness is Dr. Gaind’s evidence. Even his
    evidence does not support the motion judge’s conclusion that the father could
    get better and return to a form of work that could generate an after tax annual
    income of $80,000.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gaind explained his diagnosis of malingering in terms of the father’s concocting
    a story about a suicide attempt to avoid the consequences of pulling a hotel
    fire alarm. However, he described the father’s narcissistic personality
    disorder as “severe” and also described the father as having “decompensated
    increasingly” in the past five years since his marriage broke up. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gaind also noted that persons with a narcissistic personality have a “very
    marked tendency towards lying and exaggeration” and said “this will make it
    very difficult for [the father] to get any meaningful help.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    Dr. Gaind gave no opinion concerning whether and how the father’s condition
    might improve, concerning how long that might take – and if the father’s
    condition did improve, concerning the likelihood that the father could return
    to significant gainful employment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, in contrast to the evidence of Dr. Gaind, Dr. Turner’s evidence
    suggests that the father’s illness is of a broader scope. Moreover, he did not
    foresee the father getting better. In particular, in a letter dated December
    30, 2009, Dr. Turner reached the conclusion that the father was:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[C]learly totally disabled from his former profession and from
    any competitive alternate employment related to the severity of his continuing
    psychiatric symptoms and cognitive symptoms. I do not foresee any significant
    improvement in his psychiatric symptoms …</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    premise of the consent order was that the father was disabled by his illness
    from practising psychiatry. However one characterizes the father’s illness, the
    record contains no medical evidence to support a finding that it was likely
    that he could get better and return to work as a psychiatrist or in a
    competitive alternative field of employment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the record contains no medical evidence to support a finding that the father’s
    condition was likely to improve such that he could return to any identifiable
    form of employment that would generate an annual after tax income of $80,000. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did not specify what she meant by “get[ting] better”. If she meant
    simply that the father’s condition was likely to improve enough that he could
    work in some lesser, but still well-paying, form of employment, again the
    record does not support this finding. As I have said, there was simply no
    evidence that the father’s condition was likely to improve.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the motion judge failed to refer to any specific evidence that would support
    her finding that the father could earn an annual after tax income of $80,000 if
    his condition did improve to some extent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the motion judge’s finding, the fact that the father chose to spend, on
    average, $80,000 per year, does not support a finding that he could generate an
    after tax income equivalent to that amount.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    s. 19 of the <em>Guidelines</em> provides the court with a broad discretion to
    impute income, in <em>Drygala v. Pauli</em> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 711 (C.A.), at
    para. 44, this court confirmed that a rational basis must exist for the amount
    that is chosen:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Section 19 of the Guidelines is not an invitation to the court
    to arbitrarily select an amount as imputed income. There must be a rational
    basis underlying the selection of any such figure. The amount selected as an
    exercise of the court’s discretion must be grounded in the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had
    there been some basis for concluding that the father’s condition was likely to
    improve, in my view, the motion judge erred in failing to identify a proper
    basis for imputing to him an annual after tax income of $80,000.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='line-height:

    finding that the father had chosen not to follow an “active treatment” plan,
    the motion judge relied on the fact that he had “doctor-shop[ped]” and that he
    saw 209 different doctors between April 2004 and June 2011. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    reasoning ignores, or rejects without explanation, important elements of the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it ignores the fact that, when not in hospital between January
    2007 to December 2011, the father saw Dr. Turner on 45 occasions – a course of
    visits and hospitalizations that Dr. Turner described as constituting “adequate
    and reasonable” psychiatric treatment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, even if the evidence supported a finding that the father failed to
    follow an “active treatment” plan, there was no evidence demonstrating on a
    balance of probabilities that the father would have recovered had he done so.
    As I have said, Dr. Gaind did not give that evidence; nor is any such evidence
    to be found in Dr. Patterson’s discharge summary or in Dr. Turner’s account of
    Dr. Adam’s discharge summary. Dr. Turner’s evidence is explicitly to the
    contrary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her affidavit, the mother relies on the father’s alleged failure to follow
    through with treatment with Dr. Hoffman, which she understood he was receiving
    at the time of the consent order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OHIP
    records forming part of the record disclose that the father saw Dr. Hoffman
    about once a month between January and September 2007 – and that the father did
    not see Dr. Hoffman after that. In the light of the fact that Dr. Turner’s
    treatment of the appellant as described in his November 2009 report to CPP was
    “monthly psychotherapy”, I am unable to understand how the father’s termination
    of monthly psychotherapy with Dr. Hoffman could support a finding that the
    father failed to follow an active treatment plan.<a href="#_ftn20"

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the motion judge made a palpable
    and overriding error in holding that the father could have gotten better,
    returned to work commencing in August 2007, and earned an after tax income of
    $80,000 per year. It follows that the motion judge also erred in holding that
    the father’s annual income for child support purposes is $118,000. I would set
    these findings aside. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>What is the father’s annual income for child support purposes?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father submits that he is totally disabled by his illness from working and
    that, apart from his annual CPP disability payments totalling $12,266 per year,
    he has had essentially no income for child support purposes since January 2007. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, the father submits that his 2008 RRSP income should not be treated
    as income for child support purposes and that all the proceeds of the motor
    vehicle accident settlement he received were on account of pain and suffering
    and therefore are not income for child support purposes. In addition, the
    father relies on the fact that the motion judge made no finding that his  property
    has not been reasonably used to generate income that would justify imputing
    income to the father under s. 19(1)(e) of the <em>Guidelines</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not accept these submissions. For reasons that I will explain, I conclude
    that the father’s 2008 RRSP income should be treated as income for child
    support purposes. Further, while I consider that it would be open to this court
    to treat some portion of the proceeds of the father’s motor vehicle accident
    settlement as income for child support purposes and to impute some modest employment
    income to him based on underemployment, I conclude that the better course is to
    impute income to the father under s. 19(1)(e) of the <em>Guidelines</em>.</p>
  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The father’s RRSP
    income </h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father submits that the motion judge treated his 2008 RRSP income as capital and
    not as income because, when imputing income to him, she described his 2008 RRSP
    income as part of the capital he chose to live on. Relying on s. 17 of the <em>Guidelines </em>and <em>P.(J.M.) v. K.(T.L.)</em>, [2008] W.D.F.L. 2803 (Ont. S.C.), the
    father contends that the motion judge’s characterization is correct and that
    his 2008 RRSP income should not be treated as income for child support purposes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>P.(J.M.) v. K.(T.L</em>.), the trial judge expressed the view that “the
    treatment of RRSP receipts as income for child support purposes is
    discretionary under the express terms of the [<em>Guidelines</em>].” The trial
    judge in <em>P.(J.M.)</em><i> </i>also said that if the RRSP has been subject
    to equalization, “that will be an important factor militating against inclusion
    of the receipts in calculating income for child support purposes.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the father relies on his assertion that his RRSPs were equalized as
    part of the settlement effected by the consent order, as well as the fact that
    the RRSP withdrawal was a non-recurring event and was used to assist in the
    purchase of a home to argue that it should not be treated as income for child
    support purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not accept these submissions. Subject to ss. 17-20 of the <em>Guidelines</em>,
    s. 16 provides that a spouse’s annual income for child support purposes is
    determined using the sources of income set out under the heading “Total income”
    on the T1 tax form. RRSP income is included as part of Total income on the T1
    tax form. Accordingly, subject to ss. 17-20 of the <em>Guidelines</em>, RRSP
    income received in a particular year is presumptively part of a spouse’s income
    for child support purposes.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    17 of the <em>Guidelines</em> permits a court to depart from the income
    determination made under s. 16 where it is satisfied that would not be the
    fairest determination of income. In such a case, the court may have regard to
    the spouse’s income over the last three years and determine an amount that is
    fair and reasonable “in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income
    or receipt of a non-recurring amount during those years.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    begin with, I am not persuaded that the father has demonstrated that treating
    his RRSP withdrawal as income “would not lead to the fairest determination of …
    income”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Stevens
    v. Boulerice</em>, [1999] O.J. No. 1568, 49 R.F.L. (4th) 425 (S.C.), Aitken J. declined
    for two reasons to exclude RRSP withdrawals from income simply because the RRSP
    had been the subject of an equalization calculation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she noted
    that s. 16 of the <em>Guidelines</em> requires that RRSP withdrawals be
    included as income for child support purposes. Further, Schedule III to the <em>Guidelines</em>,
    which provides some special rules for adjustments to income for child support
    purposes in certain cases, does not make any special provision for RRSP
    income.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Aitken
    J. observed that the equalization was a matter between the parents while the
    issue before her was a question of child support. She could see no reason why
    an available source of income to fund child support should be excluded because
    of dealings between the parents. The child support was not being paid to
    increase the mother’s lifestyle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find this
    reasoning persuasive. The clear wording of the <em>Guidelines</em> includes
    RRSP withdrawals as income and no special exception for RRSP withdrawals has
    been provided in Schedule III. Although I would acknowledge the possibility
    that the facts of a particular equalization could in theory reach the threshold
    of unfairness, I have no evidence about the specifics of the equalization
    calculation that occurred in this case and cannot so conclude. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, I do
    not consider the fact that the father may have used some or all of the RRSP on
    account of his house purchase as a factor creating unfairness in terms of
    characterizing the RRSP. Particularly in circumstances where he was not
    working, the father’s first obligation was to ensure that his children were
    properly supported. The fact that the father  chose instead to buy a four
    bedroom house should not deprive his children of an available source of child
    support. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I am of
    the opinion, that some of the early cases relied on by the trial judge in <em>P.(J.M.)
    v. K.(T.L.)</em>, at para. 161, which adopted the view that non-recurring
    withdrawals from RRSPs should essentially be automatically excluded from income
    for child support purposes, have been superseded by amendments to s. 17<a
href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[21]</span></span></span></a> and by subsequent case law such as <em>Stevens v. Boulerice</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event,
    the father’s material does not disclose his income for the three years
    preceding 2008 – the year that he reported $152,946 in RRSP income. Absent such
    disclosure, I cannot perform the steps required under s. 17. If the father
    wished to invoke s. 17 of the <em>Guidelines</em>, he should have made proper
    disclosure. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the
    foregoing reasons, I would hold that the father’s 2008 RRSP income is income
    for that year for child support purposes.  </p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The proceeds of the motor vehicle
    accident settlement  and imputing income </h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said,
    in my view, it would be open to this court to treat a portion of the proceeds
    of the motor vehicle accident settlement the father received as income for
    child support purposes and to impute a modest amount of employment income to
    the father based on undermployment. Nonetheless, I conclude that the better
    course is to impute income to the father under s. 19(1)(e) of the <em>Guidelines</em>.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Proceeds of the Motor Vehicle Accident Settlement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 2010,
    the father received $269,441.08 to settle his claim for damages arising from a
    2005 motor vehicle accident. The father maintains that the entire amount of the
    award was for pain and suffering and thus he did not report any portion of the
    settlement proceeds as lost income for income tax purposes.<a href="#_ftn22"
name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[22]</span></span></span></a> For the same reason, he submits that none of the settlement proceeds should be
    treated as income for child support purposes. In that regard, he relies on <em>Rivard
    v. Hankiewicz</em>, 2007 ONCJ 180, 38 R.F.L. (6th) 189, at paras. 32-33, which
    he submits stands for the proposition that only the portion of personal injury
    settlement funds attributable to lost income will be treated as income for
    child support purposes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not find
    these submissions persuasive. As I have said, the father provided no documentary
    evidence, and no evidence from his counsel in the personal injury action, to
    support his claim that the entire amount of the settlement proceeds represents
    damages for pain and suffering. Although I consider it possible that a
    settlement was reached without allocating amounts to specific heads of damages,
    I find it unlikely that the father received such a significant settlement
    without any portion of it being attributable to past or future loss of income. If
    the father contends that <em>Rivard v. Hankiewicz</em> stands for the
    proposition that only funds specifically designated in a settlement as being on
    account of wage loss should be treated as income for child support purposes, I
    reject that proposition. In addition to the case cited in <em>Rivard v. Hankiewicz</em> that the father relies on, that decision also refers to cases in which courts
    treated all or a portion of settlement proceeds as being attributable to lost
    income even though no specific allocation of the damages had been made.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said,
    because of the father’s failure to make proper disclosure, any allocation of
    the settlement proceeds made by this court would be entirely arbitrary. Moreover,
    the parties provided us with no authorities concerning the tax treatment of
    motor vehicle accident settlement proceeds. As noted in footnote 22, our
    research suggests that no portion of such proceeds is taxable and, accordingly,
    that any amounts we might attribute to past or future income loss should be
    grossed up in the father’s hands for income tax. However, we have not had the
    benefit of submissions from the parties concerning this issue. </p>

lang=EN-US>Although I have concluded that the motion judge made a palpable and
    overriding error in holding that the father could get better, return to work
    and earn an after tax income of $80,000 per year</span>, that is not to say
    that the father should not have attempted to maintain gainful employment of
    some kind.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the record
    makes it clear that the father could not work as a medical doctor or in any capacity
    likely to generate an after tax annual income of $80,000, in my opinion, it
    does not support a finding that the father could not have engaged in some form
    of employment sufficient to generate at least a minimum wage on at least a
    part-time basis at least until he began living in the retirement home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    that regard, I note that Dr. Turner never gives an opinion that the father
    could not work at some form of minimally demanding employment. Particularly
    where child support is at issue, any assertion that a parent is totally
    disabled and unable to generate any income should be supported by cogent
    medical evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>That said, taking account of the father’s mental health problems and
    frequent hospitalizations, I am unable to identify anything that the father
    might have done to generate an income other than to work at some form of
    minimum wage, likely part-time, type of employment – and even in that form of
    employment, the father may well have had difficulty maintaining a job.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Taking account of the father’s lack of disclosure concerning the
    details of his motor vehicle accident settlement, the absence of submissions
    concerning the income tax consequences arising from that settlement, and the
    difficulties inherent in imputing income to the father due to underemployment
    in the unique circumstances of this case, it seems to me that the better course
    is to impute income to the father under s. 19(1)(e) of the </span><em>Guidelines</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>Section 19(1)(e) of the </span><em>Guidelines</em><span lang=EN-US> permits a court to impute income to a spouse where the spouse’s property is not
    reasonably utilized to generate income. As I have said, in this case, the
    father received monies, consisting of both capital and income, in excess of
    $800,000 during the period between September 1, 2007 and September 1, 2010.
    Having regard to the father’s obligations to support his children and his
    inability to continue to work at employment that would generate a significant
    income when he had done so in the past, I consider it unreasonable that he
    would not have invested some significant portion of those receipts to generate
    income that could be used in part to help support his children. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In all the circumstances, I find that it was unreasonable for the
    father not to have invested at least the sale proceeds from his wine collection
    and the proceeds of his motor vehicle accident settlement to generate an
    income. These amounts ultimately total $611,216. No evidence was led concerning
    reasonable prevailing rates of return. I would therefore impute investment
    income on that sum at the modest rate of 3% per year.</span></p>

    the table amount for $150,000 plus the table percentage (1.16% in 2008) of any
    income over $150,000 unless the court considers the total yielded  inappropriate.

    the medication aspect of his care and had met with Dr. Brian Hoffman earlier
    this week. I had made it clear to [the father] that I would be able to manage
    his psychiatric medication but not necessarily all other aspects, which
    included psychotherapy, and some of the medical/legal component of his care.
    Therefore today, I have advised him, and he has agreed that I would continue
    with his medication treatments and he would continue to see Dr. Hoffman at the
    usual monthly intervals. Dr. Hoffman was planning to be away over the next
    month and there was going to be a hiatus in the continuing care, which was a

    Dr. Turner and Dr. Hoffman but was successful in speaking only to Dr. Hoffman.
    Dr. Gaind says Dr. Hoffman advised him that the father was no longer planning
    to return to Dr. Hoffman although Dr. Hoffman was willing to have him back.
    This aspect of Dr. Gaind’s report is clearly hearsay.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>As I have said, the
