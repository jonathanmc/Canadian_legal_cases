  <p><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Lauwers
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The motion judge,
    sitting as a judge on the Commercial List, granted partial summary judgment in a
    commercial dispute about the exercise of a shotgun buy-sell provision in a
    partnership agreement.  He ruled that although the respondents’ buy-sell offer did
    not comply perfectly with the shotgun buy-sell provision, it was nonetheless
    valid and enforceable. He directed a trial on the appellants’ claims for
    damages for three breaches of contract. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>For the reasons
    set out below, I would dismiss the appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Overview </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The respondent Alpa
    Partnership operated through the respondent Alpa Lumber Inc. and some 89
    corporations and partnerships. It was in the business of manufacturing and
    distributing wood products for the low-rise residential building industry in
    Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>According to the
    Statement of Claim, Alpa Partnership was established in 1978 as the result of a
    leveraged buyout of Reed Lumber Co. Donald MacIver was the president and CEO of
    the parent company, Reed Paper Ltd. He joined the partnership, and was
    “responsible for the creation of Alpa’s corporate and tax structure as well as
    its partnership documentation”. After overseeing the restructuring of the
    partnership from 1986 to 1988, he continued to have primary responsibility for
    its financial and corporate affairs and, until June 14, 2010, was its Chairman
    and Secretary-Treasurer. Relations between the partner shareholders and Mr.
    MacIver deteriorated over time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The core business
    arrangement was the 1997 Amended Restated Partnership Agreement (the “PA”). The
    partner corporations, and their associated partner shareholders were,
    respectively: Di Poce Management Limited (John Di Poce); Western Larch Limited
    (Mr. MacIver); Large Tooth Aspen Limited (Carmine Guglietti); Red Alder Limited
    (the late Giovanni Guglietti); and Eastern Hemlock Limited (George Frankfort). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In these reasons,
    the term “respondents” refers to the named respondents other than Red<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>Alder Limited, and the Guglietti Estate, since
    the motion judge dismissed the action against Red<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>Alder Limited and the Guglietti Estate, and
    that dismissal was not appealed,.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>For the purpose
    of this appeal, there were two relevant avenues by which a partner could be
    required to exit from the partnership under the PA: by the death of a
    shareholder partner, largely governed by Article 8; and, through the operation
    of the shotgun buy-sell provision, largely governed by Article 6.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Giovanni
    Guglietti’s death on September 4, 2009 triggered the partners’ obligation under
    Article 8 to buy out Red Alder’s interest. The partner shareholders, other than
    Mr. MacIver, wanted Red Alder to continue as a partner. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>As a result of
    Mr. MacIver’s opposition, the other partner shareholders adopted a two-pronged
    strategy. The first prong was that on December 11, 2009, Di Poce Management,
    Eastern Hemlock and Large Tooth Aspen agreed with Red Alder to bring it back
    into a restructured partnership, conditional upon the successful execution of
    the second prong, which was the buy-out of Western Larch by the other partners.
    On December 15, 2009, Di Poce Management, Eastern Hemlock and Large Tooth Aspen
    delivered their shotgun buy-sell offer to Western Larch.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The buy-sell
    offer contained two alternatives, either one of which could have been accepted
    by the appellants. The alternatives differed in their treatment of debt. Under
    s. 6.11(a) of the PA, the partnership is obliged to repay its debt to the
    exiting partner “in full on closing”. Alternative 2 would have repaid the
    partnership’s debt to Western Larch on closing as required by the PA.
    Alternative 1 provided instead for the repayment of half of the debt on closing,
    with the balance to be paid over four years together with interest. The buy-sell
    offer also provided that if the appellants did not choose between the
    alternatives, and did not elect to reverse the buy-sell offer, they would be
    deemed to have chosen Alternative 1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Mr. MacIver did
    not complain about the valuation of the partnership used in calculating the
    purchase and sale prices, or about the form of the buy-sell offer, when he was
    presented with it.  Instead, he and Western Larch, tried to secure financing so
    that they could reverse the offer, and buy out the interests of the respondents. 
    Their efforts were not successful.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Mr. MacIver and
    Western Larch then attacked the validity of the buy-sell offer by issuing the
    Statement of Claim dated February 12, 2010. In early May 2010, they moved
    unsuccessfully for an interim and interlocutory injunction to restrain the respondents
    from implementing or attempting to implement the buy-sell offer: see 2010 ONSC
    3046, Cumming J. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The forced
    acquisition of the appellants’ interest in the partnership was carried out in
    accordance with Alternative 1 in the buy-sell offer, and closed on June 14,
    2010. The appellants were paid about $33 million, including an amount on
    account of the partnership’s debt to Western Larch to be paid over four years
    together with interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The respondents
    moved for summary judgment to dismiss the action. Partial summary judgment was
    granted, by D.M. Brown J. (the motion judge), for the reasons reported at 2012
    ONSC 7014.  This appeal is from his judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Standard of Review</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The standard of
    review on this appeal is correctness, since it involves the interpretation of a
    contract, with due deference to be paid to the motion judge on those
    determinations in which the facts dominate: <i>The Plan Group v. Bell Canada</i>,
    2009 ONCA 548, 96 O.R. (3d) 81, at paras. 19-20, 27; <i>Zeubear Investments Ltd</i>.<i> v. Magi Seal Corporation</i>, 2010 ONCA 825, 103 O.R. (3d) 578, at para. 22.
    This court has, on numerous occasions, paid deference to experienced Commercial
    List judges in contractual interpretation. For example, in <i>Ventas,
    Inc.&nbsp;v.&nbsp; Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust</i>,&nbsp;2007
    ONCA 205, 85 O.R. (3d) 254, at para. 47, Blair J.A. said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Matters involving the factual matrix underlying a contract are
    matters of fact, or at least matters of mixed fact and law. A judge is owed
    considerable deference in her assessment of such matters. Here, the experienced
    Commercial List judge was exercising a function common to that role - the
    interpretation of a commercial contract…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>See also <i>Treat
    America Limited&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Nestlé Canada Inc.</i>,&nbsp;2011 ONCA 560, at
    para. 15, Blair J.A.; </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:

    Services Trust</span></em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>,&nbsp;2011
    ONCA 518 at para. 3, among others. These decisions recognize, as Farley J.
    observed, in </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>771225
    Ontario Inc. v. Bramco Holdings Co</span></em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:200%'>., [1992] O.J. No. 1772, that “judges available to sit in the
    List are some of those who have experience, expertise and an interest by
    aptitude and inclination in &quot;corporate/commercial matters&quot;, of a
    complex or intricate nature”. The Commercial List is a specialized court for
    the purpose of situating the decision on the spectrum of deference required by <i>Housen
    v. Nikolaisen</i>, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Decision under Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellants
    argued that the law required the buy-sell offer to comply strictly with Article
    6 of the PA, the shotgun buy-sell provision. The motion judge accepted this as
    a correct statement of the law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellants
    took the position that the buy-sell offer did not comply strictly with the
    shotgun buy-sell provision in the PA and was therefore invalid; they alleged
    that there were numerous deficiencies, so that it was not open to the
    respondents to enforce it. A non-compliant shotgun buy-sell offer is an
    ordinary, and therefore, prima facie, legally valid, offer to buy or to sell, but
    it lacks enforceability for shotgun purposes. Thus, one party is not able to
    force another party to close on the terms of the offer. I observe that the
    motion judge and the parties use the language of “validity” in this limited
    sense of shotgun enforceability, and I will use it the same way.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The motion judge adopted
    the approach of categorizing the different elements of the shotgun buy-sell
    provision. He referred to some terms, at para. 123, as “categories of
    contractual provisions [that] deal with the issue of the formation of a binding
    agreement of purchase or sale”, while he characterized other terms as dealing
    “not with the making of a binding agreement, but its performance.” He explained
    his approach, at para. 124:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The plaintiffs contend, in effect, that the breach of any
    Article 6 term invalidates an offer. I do not agree. The breach of those
    categories of contractual terms dealing with the making of an offer would
    invalidate an offer, but the breach of terms falling in the performance
    categories would give rise to a claim for breach of a binding agreement of

    market value of the partnership.  Their case, at bottom, is about the amount
    that the respondents must pay in order to buy out their interest in the
    partnership. The appellants’ “strict compliance” attack on the buy-sell offer
    is their chosen weapon in seeking the court’s assistance to reopen the issue of
    the partnership’s value, which is essential in establishing damages. The
    appellants quantify the prize in this fight at “not less than $79 million”, largely
    being the asserted difference in the value of their interest in the partnership,
    measured as between the specified value in the buy-sell offer, and the
    appellants’ own estimate of fair market value.</span></p>

    made five additional complaints. The first was that the buy-sell offer built in
    the partnership’s obligation to buy out Red Alder. As a result, the specified
    formula in s. 6.2 of the PA for calculating the respective shares was not met. 
    The motion judge rejected this complaint on the basis that the partnership was
    obliged, under Article 8 of the PA, to buy out Red Alder on Mr. Guglietti’s
    death. The effect was to increase Western Larch’s partnership share to 16.75
    per cent, but, as the motion judge pointed out, at para. 158, “Article 8
    required Western Larch to pay for that increased share; it was not a gift.”</span></p>

    concluded that, since the PA permitted a buy-sell offer to be made at any time,
    it was only reasonable that this would include a period after a partner
    shareholder’s death and before the Partnership’s obligations in respect of that
    death were worked out. Although there was a timing difference concerning
    payments due under Article 8 and Article 6, the motion judge decided, at para.
    161, that the deduction of the entire Red Alder obligation in calculating the
    purchase price was “commercially reasonable”. </span></p>

    second additional complaint, referred to at para. 165 of the reasons, concerned
    the form of the promissory note delivered on closing, in particular, the
    inclusion of language providing that “[t]his Promissory Note shall not be
    negotiable or assignable by the holder without the prior written consent of the
    undersigned”. The motion judge dismissed this complaint, at para. 166, on the
    basis that s. 6.5(2) of the PA did not preclude the inclusion of additional
    terms, but, in fact, it contemplated that possibility.  He noted that the
    objection to the included language was only brought forward by the appellants
    one hour before the closing, although they had had the closing material for ten
    days. The motion judge called this a “high risk strategy”. He held, at para.
    167, that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>For the vendor to sit back, to rebuff invitations to comment on
    the draft closing documentation, and then to spring comments on the purchasers

    third additional complaint was about the inclusion of an incorrect debt
    adjustment figure in the buy-sell offer. In mid-January 2010, the offerors sent
    a letter to the appellants providing the correct figure for closing.  The
    motion judge found that it was proper for an estimated debt figure to have been
    used when the offer was made since the actual indebtedness had to be finalized
    as part of the closing arrangements. He found, at para. 182, that “nothing in
    the Agreement prohibited the making of adjustments on the closing of a buy-sell
    offer.” The motion judge concluded, at para. 183, that the appellants would
    have received the amount to which they were contractually entitled on closing,
    so that there was “no air of commercial reality to this objection by Western
    Larch.”  </span></p>

    fourth additional complaint concerned the termination date of Western Larch’s
    allocation of net earnings. The PA required that entitlement to end on April
    14, 2010. The offer provided, however, that the net earnings were to be
    calculated at the end of the prior month, on March 31, 2010. The appellants
    argued that this two week difference was yet another fatal failure to comply
    that rendered the buy-sell offer invalid. The motion judge found that this
    provision in the offer was inconsistent with the PA, but held that it did not
    render the offer unenforceable.  He stated, at para. 192: “Non-compliance with
    that performance requirement would not invalidate an offer, but non-compliance
    could give rise to a claim for any shortfall in net earnings for the period
    between the delivery of an offer and closing.” The motion judge found that the
    appellants could be entitled to damages for the two-week difference and
    directed a trial of that issue. </span></p>

    fifth additional complaint was that the buy-sell offer completely eliminated
    Western Larch’s interest in the partnership, contrary to the terms of a
    separate Acknowledgment letter that was signed by the partners
    contemporaneously with the execution of the PA. The Acknowledgment provided:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]f either Di Poce Management Limited or Western Larch Limited

    buy-sell offer’s failure to provide a continuing nominal interest in the
    partnership. The motion judge found that the offer was deficient in failing to
    give effect to the Acknowledgment.  He also found, at para. 200, that the
    appellants had failed to bring this omission to the attention of the
    respondents. Although the tax advantage may have been somewhat attenuated by
    recent <i>Income Tax Act</i> amendments, the motion judge was not in a position
    to quantify the damage and directed a trial of that issue. He noted that this

    identified in the buy-sell offer should have been sufficient to render the buy-sell

    shareholder agreements, partnership agreements, and joint venture agreements
    often contain what is commonly known as a “shotgun buy-sell provision”. This is
    a mechanism for involuntarily expelling one or more of the parties from a
    business venture, which will continue without the exiting party’s participation.
    Expulsion is a remedy available where, for example, the participants no longer
    get along, as in this case.  </span></p>

    generally share the following features. The offeror party triggers the
    provision by putting a shotgun buy-sell offer to the offeree party. The offeror
    offers to buy the offeree’s interest in the business venture, or to sell its
    own interest to the offeree. The offer specifies a value. The offeree must
    decide whether to buy out the offeror, or to sell its interest to the offeror, at
    the determined price. Depending on the size of the respective interests, the
    amounts paid to buy, on the one hand, and to sell, on the other hand, may be
    quite different, although they are to be based on the specified value. The
    offeree must make the choice by a certain date. If the offeree does not respond
    by choosing, then the offeror may force the purchase on the offeree, and
    require closing on the terms set out in the offer.  Not all of these features
    are always present and close attention must be paid to the specific contractual
    language of the shotgun buy-sell provision in order to ensure that an offer is

    consideration. There was no unfairness in doing so. Had the appellants accepted
    Alternative 1, then there would effectively have been an agreement to amend the
    PA along the lines of the accepted offer. In my opinion, the buy-sell offer was
    valid and enforceable, since it contained the compliant Alternative 2, which the
    appellants were free to accept or to reverse. The mere inclusion of Alternative
    1 did not invalidate the buy-sell agreement or render it unenforceable.</span></p>

    the shotgun buy-sell provision in the PA because it did not require repayment
    of the partnership’s debt to Western Larch “in full on closing”.)  The motion
    judge’s logic, laid out at paras. 175-176, was that the debt repayment
    obligation arose under section 6.11(a) of the PA as part of the “Closing

    the shotgun buy-sell provision in the unanimous shareholders agreement imposed
    a term that the buyer would pay at least 50 per cent of the purchase price in

    it did on the facts of this case. Sometimes actual performance will be of
    overriding importance and the availability of a damages claim for a performance
    breach would be very cold comfort. An exiting party has no control over the

    guarantee a price that reflects a market value. The Offeror Defendants know
    that they may be bought out at the same price they offer for the Offeree
    Plaintiffs' shares. The price offered by the Offeror Defendants is thus
    self-regulated. The specified valuation for the Alpa Partnership of
