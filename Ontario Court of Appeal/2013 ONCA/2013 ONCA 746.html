  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Michael A. Johnston, for the appellant</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Philippe G. Cowle, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard:  December 9, 2013</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the decision of Justice Mullins of the
    Superior Court of Justice rendered on September 4, 2012 at Peterborough,
    Ontario, acquitting the appellant on two charges of criminal negligence causing
    death and convicting the appellant on two charges of dangerous driving causing
    death.</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><strong><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-weight:normal'>ENDORSEMENT</span></strong></p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant was acquitted of two charges of criminal negligence
    causing death and convicted on two counts of dangerous driving causing death. 
    He appeals his convictions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charges arose out of an accident that occurred on a two-lane county
    road near Peterborough on Christmas Eve in 2009.  The appellant’s vehicle
    crossed over on to the wrong side of the road while negotiating a gentle curve
    and struck an oncoming vehicle driven by Kenneth Dales.  Mr. Dales and his wife
    were killed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons contain a full review of the evidence and an
    accurate summary of the relevant legal principles as explained most recently in <em>R. v. Beatty</em>, 2008 SCC 5 and <em>R. v. Roy</em>, 2012 SCC 26.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made several findings of fact:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But for a very small portion of the back of the appellant’s
    vehicle, the entirety of his vehicle passed over the centre line into the
    oncoming traffic.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was going over the 80 km speed limit and 30 to 40 km
    per hour faster than the vehicle he struck.  </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The accident re-constructionist could not be more specific as to
    the appellant’s speed.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s car was equipped with a radar detection device
    that was operating at the time of the accident.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The speed combined with the radar device suggested that the speed
    at which the appellant was driving was neither “inadvertent nor momentary.” </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s car was mechanically fit at the time of the
    accident. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ultimately concluded:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given that there were no mechanical flaws found in his vehicle,
    I conclude and I find as a fact that it was Mr. Baker’s actions, not his
    inaction, that accounts for his vehicle abruptly having entered almost fully,
    the wrong side of the road and colliding with another vehicle at a speed in
    excess of 80 kilometres per hour.  I reject making a finding that the presence
    of Mr. Baker’s vehicle on the wrong side of the road should be reconciled with
    momentary inattention and a failure to have guided his vehicle within a gentle curve
    scribed by the roadway, all while there was, in clear view, an oncoming vehicle
    on the opposite side of a clearly marked road and forewarning of the curve.  I
    find that in operating his vehicle at the speed he did, in all these
    circumstances, Mr. Baker left no margin for error, whether the error was of him
    or any other, and in doing so his driving constituted a marked departure from
    what a reasonably prudent driver would have done in the circumstances.  I find
    that it was his actions in steering his vehicle into the oncoming lane at such
    speed that constitutes the <em>actus reus</em> and the <em>mens rea</em> of the
    offence.</p>
  <h1>the grounds of appeal</h1>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge fail to apply the correct legal principles when
    addressing the fault component of dangerous driving?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to the fault component of dangerous driving
    and specifically adverted to the recent Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence. 
    Her description of the requisite fault requirement tracked almost word-for-word
    the description of the requisite fault component in <em>Beatty</em> at para.
    49.  <em>Beatty</em> was followed and applied in <em>Roy</em>.  The “two-stage
    approach” to the fault element referred to in <em>Roy</em>, at para. 61, was
    not intended to re-define the fault component as described in <em>Beatty</em>,
    but was intended to offer a “helpful approach” to the fault determination.  The
    trial judge’s failure to expressly identify the two questions posed in <em>Roy</em> is not an error in law.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge reverse the burden of proof?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge expressly and unequivocally instructed herself that the
    burden of proof was on the Crown and remained on the Crown throughout.  The
    passage relied on by the appellant as indicating a reversal in the burden of
    proof is no more than an application of the proper burden of proof to the
    entirety of the evidence which included evidence that no mechanical flaws were
    found in the appellant’s vehicle. </p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in finding that the appellant “intentionally”
    steered his vehicle into the oncoming lane?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This submission rests on a mischaracterization of the trial judge’s
    finding.  The trial judge found that the appellant drove his vehicle into the
    gentle curve at an excessive speed and that in doing so he had to steer
    virtually the entirety of his vehicle into the oncoming lane to negotiate the
    gentle curve.  The trial judge contrasted this situation with one in which the
    driver finds him or herself unable to negotiate a curve because of momentary
    inattention.  The distinction was one which was potentially important to the
    fault component of the offence and one which was available on the entirety of
    the evidence.</p>
  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge presume guilt on the basis that the appellant’s car
    was in an accident?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument rests on the submission that the appellant’s car
    “inexplicably” veered across the road while negotiating the curve.  The trial
    judge, however, did not find that the actions of the vehicle were
    “inexplicable”.  She found that the car veered into oncoming traffic because
    the appellant chose to drive the car into the curve at a rate of speed which
    did not allow him to keep his vehicle on his side of the road when negotiating
    the curve.  The trial judge did not fall into the error of assigning blame
    based on the consequences of the appellant’s driving. </p>
  <h3>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the verdict unreasonable?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    point at which conduct passes beyond negligence to criminally dangerous driving
    can be difficult to discern.  The appellant’s argument that the verdicts were
    unreasonable rests on the contention that there was “no evidence of what caused
    the Toyota 4Runner (the appellant’s vehicle) to veer into the southbound lane”. 
    The appellant also argues that as there was no evidence of the exact speed at
    which the appellant was driving, the court could not say at what point i.e. at
    what speed, the appellant’s driving became dangerous.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to counsel’s able submissions, there was clear evidence of what caused
    the vehicle to enter the oncoming lane.  The evidence reasonably permitted the
    inference that the appellant was going much too fast when entering the curve
    and could not negotiate the curve on his own side of the road, but rather had
    to steer virtually his entire vehicle into the oncoming lane.  This inference
    was available even though the evidence did not allow the trial judge to make a
    finding as to the specific speed at which the appellant’s vehicle was
    travelling when it entered the curve.  There was evidence that the appellant
    was driving over the 80 km per hour speed limit.  The exact speed of the
    vehicle was not crucial to a finding that the speed was such as to require the
    appellant to make the turn by passing almost entirely over the centre line into
    the oncoming lane.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not testify.  We are entitled to take that into account in
    assessing the reasonableness of the verdict. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
