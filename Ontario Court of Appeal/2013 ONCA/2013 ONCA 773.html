    appellant operated an automobile detailing business. On July 16, 2008, the
    complainant, D.N., then 14 years old, worked with the appellant detailing cars.
    Afterwards they went to dinner. The appellant testified that the complainant
    insisted on being paid that day. Since he had no cash with him, she had to go
    to his apartment. The complainant testified, however, that the appellant
    invited her to the apartment to learn how to make an appointment.  </span></p>

    ground that the appellant lived with his parents in a small, two bedroom, open
    concept apartment. The appellant and the complainant spent 20 minutes or so
    talking with his parents at the kitchen table and then went into the appellants
    bedroom to look at paperwork for the business. The appellant spread the
    paperwork out on the bed and the two of them spent about 20 minutes looking it
    over.</span></p>

    complainant testified that the appellant then closed the door, opened the
    window and offered her marihuana. She smoked it and had a strong reaction,
    leaving her lying on the bed, feeling dizzy.  The trial judge noted the
    following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>She described a sexual assault, where [the appellant] held her
    down by the shoulders and her arms, removed her jeans and underwear, removed
    his own jeans and had intercourse with her. [The complainant] said she felt
    weak and could not get [the appellant] off her, that she was in and out of
    consciousness and that she tried to say no. At some point [the appellant] got
    off her and she gathered her purse and left.</p>

    deal with that application in the course of resolving the last two issues.</span></p>

    complains that: The trial judge accepted the naïve complainants word
    without the need for any corroboration, while she approached the appellants
    evidence like a <em>Vetrovec</em> witness in the sense that it was unworthy of
    belief absent independent evidence to restore her faith in suspect testimony. The
    appellant argues that the trial record shows that the trial judge demonstrably
    applied different standards in assessing the evidence. </span></p>

    the validity of such a complaint was set by this court in <em>R. v. J.H.</em>,
    [2005] O.J. No. 39 (C.A.). Doherty J.A. noted, at para 47, that such a
    complaint is often a thinly veiled invitation to this court to substitute its
    own credibility findings for those of the trial judge, and amounts to an
    assertion that the verdict is unreasonable. He added, at para. 59:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>This argument or some variation on it is common on appeals from
    conviction in judge alone trials where the evidence pits the word of the
    complainant against the denial of the accused and the result turns on the trial
    judge's credibility assessments. This is a difficult argument to make
    successfully. It is not enough to show that a different trial judge could have
    reached a different credibility assessment, or that the trial judge failed to
    say something that he could have said in assessing the respective credibility
    of the complainant and the accused, or that he failed to expressly set out
    legal principles relevant to that credibility assessment. To succeed in this
    kind of argument, the appellant must point to something in the reasons of the
    trial judge or perhaps elsewhere in the record that make it clear that the
    trial judge had applied different standards in assessing the evidence of the
    appellant and the complainant.</p>

    reasonable doubt by his evidence. She considered the evidence of the

    appellant did not keep records, yet he appeared to have a comprehensive recall
    of the number of vehicles that he had serviced on July 16, 2008 when the police
    questioned him in late November of that year. But, in describing the course of
    the day, the trial judge observed that he made a number of logically
    inconsistent statements. The appellants evidence that he did not have enough
    cash on hand to pay the complainant was contradicted by his evidence about the
    number of the vehicles that he said that he serviced that day.  As a result, he
    changed his evidence on at least two occasions to reduce the number of cars
    serviced. The trial judge described as unbelievable that the appellant would

    of the day if, in fact, you dont keep your money at your place of business. 
    She also rejected the appellants innocent explanation of reviewing paperwork in
    his bedroom (because it had no table and chairs) as in the past he had twice

    Elsewhere she added that the complaint gave her evidence in a straightforward
    way, not emotional, not embellished and without any sweeping allegations. The
    complainant admitted that there were no inappropriate looks or conduct or words
    prior to the incident. She admitted agreeing that the price of her dinner would
    be deducted from her pay for the day. She admitted that she smoked marihuana
    with the appellant and was afraid to tell her mother about the assault because

    accurately i.&nbsp;observe; ii. recall; and iii. recount events in issue. Any
    witness whose evidence on an issue is not credible cannot give reliable
    evidence on the same point. Credibility, on the other hand, is not a proxy for

    admitted smoking marihuana with the complainant, although he said it was
    outside. The trial judge rejected the reliability argument in the following
    words:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Defence counsel argued that [the complainants] statement that
    the intercourse lasted an hour is completely unbelievable. I do not find that
    the complainants credibility is terribly damaged by her confusion over time.
    She repeated that she was drowsy and in and out of consciousness. She was a 14 year
    old girl, high on drugs who was not sexually active. That her time estimates
    with respect to the sex act are likely not accurate, does not immediately
    damage her credibility. I take into account her age and lack of sexual
    experience as she tried to relate what had happened and in particular, where
    certain body parts were for how long during a sexual assault. It was obvious in
    her interview with the police that she was sexually naïve.</p>

    focussed on the important issue, which was whether the sexual assault took
    place. She found that the complainants evidence was reliable on that point,
    even though the complainant might well have been mistaken about the duration of
    the assault. In my view, the trial judge adverted to and resolved the
    reliability issue. I am not persuaded that she erred in her approach or in the

  <p class=CQuote>This argument is a double-edged sword for the defence. 
    Firstly, it is not unbelievable that some parents would accept that their
    31-year-old son, coming home in the evening with a woman who he can then takes
    to his bedroom [<em>sic</em>]. There was no evidence that the parents knew the
    age or grade of [the complainant] in any event, the evidence shows that it was
    completely acceptable to them that their 31-year-old son took a very young
    woman into his bedroom, according to the accused for at least 20 minutes. That
    the visit could have continued for another hour or hour-and-a-half with the
    door closed is not any more unbelievable.</p>

    took the view that the appellant had orchestrated the evening to get the
    complainant to his apartment and into his bedroom for the purpose of engaging
    in sexual activity with her. She noted: the unlikelihood of the appellants
    story that he had no cash at work to pay her; that on the complainants two
    prior visits to the apartment with her cousin they had discussed business at the
    kitchen table, so there was no need to go to his bedroom to review the
    paperwork; and that the appellant gave the complainant marihuana in his bedroom.</span></p>

    trial judge carried out an adequate credibility assessment. She took account of
    the undisputed evidence. She considered the two competing narratives in light
    of the differences in the evidence of the appellant and the complainant, the
    internal inconsistencies in the appellants evidence and its plausibility, and
    basic common sense. She considered the ability of each witness to recall, the
    level of detail, and whether their evidence changed over the course of
    testifying, as the appellants plainly did. I reject the appellants argument
    that the trial judge based her assessment of the complainants credibility on
    demeanour alone. Credibility is an area where great deference is due to the
    trial judge. There is no basis for finding that she committed an error in
    principle.</span></p>

    On cross-examination, the defendant said that his father was dealing with a medical
    issue, but he did not have a medical report. He suggested that his father could
    not testify. The defence did not say that his father was asked to testify or in

  <p class=CQuote>While permissible in some cases, comment on the failure to call

    trial judge can seriously affect what might otherwise be the jury's assessment
    of the credibility of those who do testify and perhaps, more importantly the
    integrity of the case. Such comment and instruction whether referable to the
    prosecution or the defence is really a comment on the conduct of the case and
    the instruction gives it some evidentiary significance. There are many reasons
    why counsel may choose not to call a witness, and our courts will rarely
    question the decision of counsel, for the system proceeds on the basis that
    counsel conducts the case. Often a witness is not called, and if the reason was
    known it would not justify an instruction that an adverse inference might be
    drawn from the witness not being called. Of importance under our system,
    counsel is not called upon, or indeed permitted, to explain his conduct of a

  <p class=CQuote>The credibility of the defendant is critical with respect to
    one of the central issues in the case that is, whether the complainant stayed
    in the bedroom, behind a closed door for almost an hour after the business
    discussion.  [the appellants father] could therefore be considered a witness
    of some importance.  It follows, according to the Marshall decision, that this
    is a case in which an adverse inference could be drawn, that his evidence would
    be unfavourable to the accused.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>If the
    adverse inference is that the complainant was in the bedroom behind a closed
    door for a period longer than the defendant had testified</span></span>, the
    credibility of the defendant is weakened on the issue of opportunity.  And it
    further allows me to find that the credibility of the complainant is not
    damaged therefore by the testimony of the defendant on that point. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I do not accept the defendants evidence of how long he was in
    the bedroom and whether the door was closed. The absence of otherwise available
    evidence leads me to the conclusion that [fathers] evidence would not [be]
    consistent with the defendants evidence.</p>

  <p class=CQuote>The judge in the present case instructed the jury that an
    adverse inference could be drawn from the failure to call a witness but the
    nature of the inference that could be drawn was not explained to them and the
    jury may have thought that they could draw an inference of guilt, whereas the
    only inference that can be drawn, where comment on the failure to call a
    witness is appropriate, is that the jury may infer that if the witness were
    called his testimony would be unfavourable.</p>

    said that, although an inference of guilt cannot be drawn, an inference can be
    drawn that the evidence would be unfavourable: <em>Koffman</em>, <em>Marshall</em>,
    at para. 47. Other cases have said that the available inference is that the
    evidence would not be helpful or would not be supportive: <i>R. v.</i> <em>Rudge</em>,
    2011 ONCA 791, at para. 81, <em>Jolivet</em>, at para.&nbsp;28. Yet other cases

    differences in language do not get at the substantive point that Martin J.A. made
    when he distinguished, in <i>Koffman,</i> between an adverse inference of
    guilt, on the one hand, and an adverse inference that the missing evidence
    would be unfavourable, on the other hand. The significance is this: the Crown
    cannot use the adverse inference as positive evidence to meet its burden of
    proof; the adverse inference can be used only to undermine the defence evidence
    to which it relates.</span></p>

    is how the trial judge used the adverse inference. She did not use it as positive
    evidence of guilt. Instead, she considered that the absence of the fathers
    corroborative evidence further eroded the already shaky credibility of the
    appellants claim that he had no opportunity to sexually assault the
    complainant because he and the complainant were only in the bedroom for twenty
    minutes with the door open. </span></p>

    of the adverse inference was proper, since these are the very facts on which the
    appellants father would have been expected to corroborate the appellant, if
    the appellants evidence were true. Contrary to the appellants contention, the
    trial judge did not draw an inference of guilt from the absence of fathers
    evidence. She merely used the adverse inference as a basis to further explain
    why she did not find the appellant to be credible on these critical matters. As
    a result, and after considering all of the appellants testimony, she concluded
    that she did not believe the appellants version of events. </span></p>

    the door closed. The fathers failure to testify was only one part of the
    reasoning process that led the trial judge to this determination. As with all
    credibility findings, her finding is entitled to considerable deference from
    this court. </span></p>
