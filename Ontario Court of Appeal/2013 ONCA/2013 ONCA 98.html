  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal originates from a dispute between three sets of adjoining landowners
    over a road used to access their waterfront properties on Lake Panache, near
    Sudbury, Ontario. The dispute began when the parties discovered that part of
    the road lies outside of the boundaries of a right of way shown on a reference
    plan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendant surveyor, S.J. Gossling, and the defendant surveying company, D.S.
    Dorland Limited (“appellants” or “appellant surveyors”), brought the motion
    that gives rise to this appeal. They sought rectification of a reference plan
    that they prepared and that was deposited on title in the local land registry
    office in 1986. The appellants admit that the reference plan incorrectly
    portrays the right of way as running in a straight line and fails to include the
    curved portion of the gravel road that circumvents a large rock outcrop. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants asked the motion judge for an order rectifying the location of the
    right of way on the reference plan so that it would correspond with the gravel
    road as it existed on the ground when the reference plan was prepared. In
    seeking this relief, the appellants relied on s. 160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dismissed the motion for rectification. He held that the interests
    shown in the title register must prevail and concluded there was no
    jurisdiction to rectify title or balance the interests of the parties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant surveyors appeal from the order dismissing their motion. For the
    reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts of this case are straightforward and generally uncontested. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    dispute involves three adjacent waterfront lots, which originally comprised one
    parcel of land owned by Veikko Kivikangas. In 1985, Mr. Kivikangas subdivided
    the original parcel into three lots. He instructed a representative of the appellant
    surveyors to prepare a reference plan showing a right of way, which was to
    represent the location of an existing gravel road. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reference plan was deposited as Plan 53R-10717 (“R-Plan”) in the Land Registry
    for the District of Sudbury on January 7, 1986. A copy of the R-Plan is
    attached as Appendix A.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    three lots shown on the R-Plan are landlocked and do not have legal access to a
    public road. The R-Plan consists of seven parts. The westerly lot is comprised
    of Parts 1, 4 and 6. The middle lot is comprised of Parts 2, 5 and 7. The
    easterly lot is Part 3. The right of way is designated as Parts 4 and 5. Part 4
    is on the westerly lot and Part 5 is on the middle lot on the R-Plan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unbeknownst
    to Mr. Kivikangas and contrary to his instructions, the appellant surveyors
    showed Part 4 as two straight lines even though the gravel road dipped to the
    south at one point to avoid a large rock outcrop. Part 4 fails to show the dip
    in the road and so the right of way shown as Part 4 runs directly into the rock
    outcrop. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    current owners of the three lots that were subdivided by Mr. Kivikangas are
    parties to an underlying action that precipitated this motion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiffs in the action are Hugh and Kimberly MacIsaac and Karsten and
    Christina Johansen (the “plaintiffs”). The MacIsaacs purchased the middle lot
    on the R-Plan from Mr. Kivikangas in 1990. The Johansens purchased the easterly
    lot from Mr. Kivikangas in 2000. The defendant, Peggy Salo, purchased the
    westerly lot in 1992 from Gerald Gauthier and Mona Storie, who had previously
    purchased it from Mr. Kivikangas. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Mr. Kivikangas sold the three lots, he advised each purchaser that there was a
    right of way over the existing gravel road. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    portion of the right of way shown as Part 4 is located on the lot that is owned
    by the Salos, while the portion of the right of way shown as Part 5 is located
    on the lot owned by the MacIsaacs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    legal description in the transfer to the MacIsaacs describes the acquired
    parcel as being together with a right of way over Part 4 and subject to a right
    of way over Part 5 on the R-Plan. The transfer to the Johansens describes the
    acquired parcel as being together with a right of way over Parts 4 and 5. The
    legal description in the transfer from Mr. Gauthier and Ms. Storie to Ms. Salo
    describes the parcel as being “Parts 1, 4 &amp; 6, Plan 53R-50717… SUBJECT to
    right of way over Part 4, Plan 53R-10717.” In short, the plaintiffs obtained
    the benefit of a right of way over the defendants’ parcel while the defendants
    took their parcel subject to one.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Salo and her husband, Gordon Salo, incurred significant expense in making
    improvements to the gravel road that ran across their property by widening it
    and adding ditches, culverts and concrete.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Controversy
    erupted between neighbours after the plaintiffs allegedly intensified their use
    of the improved road, including using it to transport commercial trucks and
    construction equipment. The Salos contend that this increased traffic caused
    significant damage to the improved road on their property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    MacIsaacs had a survey prepared in 2005. This survey revealed that the portion
    of the road on the Salo property that circumvents the large rock outcrop is outside
    the boundaries of Part 4 and within the boundaries of Part 6.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Johansens and Salos became aware of the discrepancy between the location of the
    road on the ground and the location of the right of way on the R-Plan in
    October 2007. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    learning of the discrepancy, the Salos barricaded the section of the road on
    their lot that is located outside of Part 4 on the R-Plan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiffs responded with an action claiming damages from both the Salos and
    the surveyors. The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief to secure access to their
    properties by the existing road. They also request an order to rectify the
    register for land titles in accordance with s. 160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>.
    The Salos counter-claimed against the plaintiffs and the Salos and the
    surveyors cross-claimed against each other.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is uncontested that relocating the road to conform to the boundaries of Part 4 as
    shown on the R-Plan would require substantial blasting and roadwork.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion Judge’s decision</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion for rectification was brought by the appellant surveyors at the
    direction of the motion judge.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> On the motion, the appellants conceded that they had failed to show the right
    of way on Part 4 as instructed by Mr. Kivikangas. The appellant, Mr. Gossling,
    deposed in his affidavit: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[W]e accept that the right-of-way in 1985 curved around the
    rock and Mr. Kivikangas asked it to be documented as such, and show it as
    located on the ground, which our survey did not do. We therefore seek
    rectification of our survey and Part 4 of Reference Plan 53R-10717 to reflect
    the true intention of Veikko Kivikangas, but which was incorrectly drawn on our
    survey. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    concession was a departure from the appellants’ initial position in response to
    the plaintiffs’ action, which was that they had followed Mr. Kivikangas’s
    instructions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of their admitted mistake, the appellants sought an order rectifying
    the R-Plan so that the area shown as Part 4 corresponds with the roadway as it
    existed in January 1986. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge viewed s. 78(4) of the <i>Land Titles Act</i> as the “starting
    point for the inquiry” (at para. 14). This section states:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>78. (4) When registered, an
    instrument shall be deemed to be embodied in the register and to be effective
    according to its nature and intent, to create, transfer, charge or discharge,
    as the case requires, the land or estate or interest therein mentioned in the
    register.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge acknowledged that the court has the power to rectify the land
    titles register pursuant to ss. 159 and 160 of the <i>Land Titles Act. </i>These
    provisions state:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><a name="P2097_266411"></a><a name=s159></a><a
name=BK192></a>159.&nbsp;Subject
    to any estates or rights acquired by registration under this Act, where a court
    of competent jurisdiction has decided that a person is entitled to an estate,
    right or interest in or to registered land or a charge and as a consequence of
    the decision the court is of opinion that a rectification of the register is
    required, the court may make an order directing the register to be rectified in
    such manner as is considered just. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><a name="P2099_266918"></a><a name=s160></a><a
name=BK193></a>160. Subject to any estates or rights acquired by registration
    under this Act, if a person is aggrieved by an entry made, or by the omission
    of an entry from the register, or if default is made or unnecessary delay takes
    place in making an entry in the register, the person aggrieved by the entry,
    omission, default or delay may apply to the court for an order that the
    register be rectified, and the court may either refuse the application with or
    without costs to be paid by the applicant or may, if satisfied of the justice
    of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rectification provisions begin with the language: “Subject to any estates or
    rights acquired by registration”. The motion judge held, at para. 16, that this
    language supports the rationale of the “Torrens land titles system which fundamentally
    provides that an owner is entitled to rely upon the title abstract as an
    accurate reflection or mirror of the state of title.” He explained that under
    this system, the parcel register is not designed simply to provide notice, but
    is deemed to be conclusive of the state of title. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge observed that “indefeasibility of title is a consequence of, or
    incident of, registration” (at para. 16). In support of this assertion, he
    cited Epstein J.’s reasons in <i>Durrani v. Augier</i> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 353<a
href="http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/ca/legal/search/runRemoteLink.do?langcountry=CA&amp;linkInfo=F%23CA%23OJ%23year%252000%25sel1%252000%25ref%252960%25&amp;risb=21_T15478297606&amp;bct=A&amp;service=citation&amp;A=0.23259221959439214"
target="_parent"></a> (S.C.). At para. 49 of her reasons, Epstein J. held:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is significant that both sections [ss. 159 and 160] dealing
    with the power of the court to rectify the register start with the words
    &quot;subject to any estates or rights acquired by registration under this
    Act&quot;. These words relate back to the concept of indefeasibility of title
    and to the fundamental objectives of the land titles system discussed earlier.
    Their import is as follows. Where a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value
    succeeds in becoming a registered owner, the fact of registration is
    conclusive. Indefeasibility of title is a consequence or incident of that
    registration. Accordingly, the court does not have jurisdiction to rectify the
    register if to do so would interfere with the registered interest of a <i>bona
    fide</i> purchaser for value in the interest as registered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected the surveyors’ position that all the parties were
    innocent since the mistake was between the original owner and the surveyor. He
    concluded, at para. 19, that the parties were not innocent because any of them
    could have obtained a location plan survey at the time of purchase and learned
    of the title problem. He went on to say that even if all parties were innocent,
    the interests shown in the title register must prevail and as a result “there
    is no jurisdiction to rectify title or balance the interests of various
    innocent parties”. In this regard, he relied on the following passage from
    para. 51 of <i>Durrani</i>: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>As far as the court is concerned, when it
    comes to dealing with competing interests of innocent parties affected by
    registration, the interests shown in the registrar prevail and there is no
    jurisdiction to rectify the title even when, as in the matter before me, the
    result may appear to be inequitable.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The motion judge found there was “nothing to suggest
    that Peggy Salo was anything other than a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser for
    value” (at para. 20). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dismissed the motion for rectification because permitting
    rectification of a mistake “which did not even involve the parties to this
    action would seriously undermine the very foundation upon which the Ontario
    land titles system is based and be contrary to the governing legislation and
    established legal principles.” </p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issues</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raised two issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst style='

line-height:150%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is this an appropriate case for rectification given that this case
    involves a classic example of a mistake in the documentation of acknowledged
    common intention? </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast style='

line-height:150%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does the court have jurisdiction to grant the requested relief on either
    an equitable basis or pursuant to specific provisions of the <em>Land Titles
    Act</em>? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ontario Bar Association was granted leave to intervene as <i>amicus curiae </i>to
    address the need and legal basis for the availability of the remedy of rectification
    in the land titles system. The OBA submitted that where the parties have actual
    knowledge of an interest in land that varies from the registered interest, the
    parcel register should be rectified so that a party is not advantaged by an
    error that does not accurately reflect the interests of the parties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents, the Salos, took the position that actual notice is not a proper
    issue on appeal because it was not mentioned in the notice of motion or argued
    on the motion. Alternatively, they contended that Ms. Salo did not have actual
    notice of the location of the gravel road or of a mistake in the registry when
    she purchased the property. She did not purchase the property from Mr.
    Kivikangas or communicate with him before the purchase or see the actual road
    when she viewed the property. She deposed that the first time she and her
    husband had knowledge of the right of way was when her lawyer disclosed the
    R-Plan to them prior to closing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    supplementary submissions, the OBA advised the court that it had been under the
    mistaken impression in preparing its original factum that Ms. Salo had
    purchased her property directly from Mr. Kivikangas. The OBA’s original position
    was that rectification would be available if Mr. Kivikangas told Ms. Salo that
    she was purchasing the lot subject to a right of way that followed an existing
    gravel path. However, upon learning that Ms. Salo had not purchased the
    property from Mr. Kivikangas, the OBA submitted that the evidentiary record may
    not support a finding that Ms. Salo had actual notice that the location of the
    right of way conflicted with what was registered on title and hence
    rectification might not be available. </p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It
    seems to me that the issues as framed by the parties and the intervener do not
    speak to the problem at hand. In particular, contrary to the OBA’s submissions,
    the availability of the remedy of rectification does not depend on whether or
    not Ms. Salo had actual notice of the location on the ground of the gravel road
    before she purchased the property. This is not a situation where there is an
    interest in land that varies from a registered interest such that the court
    must decide which interest prevails. This issue has no bearing on the outcome
    of the present appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  For
    purposes of analysis and disposition, the issues on this appeal must be
    re-conceptualized.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    OBA suggests that the motion judge’s reasons indicate that the remedy of
    rectification as described in ss. 159 and 160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> is
    not available where a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser for value has actual notice
    of a competing interest in property. I agree to the extent that the motion
    judge’s reasons fail to make it clear that the statutory remedy of
    rectification is available where a party has actual notice of an interest in
    land that varies from the interest shown in the register. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s reliance on <em>Durrani</em> for the established legal
    principles is incomplete. To be precise, he did not refer in his reasons to the
    discussion in <em>Durrani</em>, at para. 52, to the effect that equity
    continues to have application to claims governed by the <em>Land Titles Act</em> and that the Act has not abrogated the equitable principle of actual notice,
    citing <em>United Trust Co. v. Dominion Stores Ltd.</em>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 915,
    at pp. 952-53. At para. 58, Epstein J. held: “It is always a necessary
    precondition for valid title that the purchaser or mortgagee be a <em>bona fide</em> or good faith purchaser for value without notice.” This principle was
    reiterated by Moore J. in <i><span lang=EN-US>719083 Ontario Ltd. v. 2174112

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the motion judge’s statement that the registration of an interest in land is
    conclusive of the state of title and that there is no jurisdiction to order
    rectification of a mistake in the registry fails to recognize that the
    equitable principle of actual notice remains enshrined in the land titles
    system. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,

    the legislative starting point for the inquiry into whether he could invoke ss.
    159 or 160 to rectify the register. Section 78(4) confirms the effectiveness of
    registered instruments in the land titles system. As explained in <em>Durrani</em>,
    indefeasibility of title is an incident of registration under the <em>Land
    Titles Act</em> and the powers of the court to order rectification are limited
    by rights acquired through the registration of an instrument in the register by
    a <i><span lang=EN-US>bona fide </span></i><span lang=EN-US>purchaser for value

    motion judge, the parties and the OBA failed to distinguish between a
    registered instrument in the land titles system, such as a transfer or a
    charge, and a reference plan that is deposited for record in the land registry
    office in accordance with s. 150(1) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. This
    subsection states:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>150. (1)&nbsp;A transfer or charge of freehold or
    leasehold land shall not be registered unless a plan of the land prepared by an
    Ontario land surveyor, to be known as a reference plan, has been deposited for

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    qualification in s. 140(2) to the principle of indefeasibility of title is a
    reflection of the important distinction between boundaries as described by a
    reference plan and boundaries as established on the ground by a surveyor
    through measurement and monumentation. The former Executive Director of the
    Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, Lorraine Petzold, shed light on this
    distinction in an insightful lecture at the Law Society of Upper Canada.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> The paper states, at p. 2,  that land surveyors “in laying out and establishing
    boundaries for the first time, are primarily involved in the technical task of
    measuring and monumenting a parcel of land to the specification of the owner”.
    On the subject of misdescription, she adds that “it is important to realize
    that the word ‘boundary’ means the original limit of a parcel as it was set out
    on the ground, not as it was described” (at p. 5).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    prospective purchasers of property in the land titles system must understand
    that the parcel description of a property – including an incorporated reference
    plan – is not definitive of the boundaries or the extent of the land. Only an
    up-to-date survey can confirm the location of the boundaries of a parcel of
    land as they exist on the ground: see Marguerite E. Moore, <i>Title Searching
    &amp; Conveyancing in Ontario</i>, 6th ed. (Canada: LexisNexis Canada Inc.,
    2010), at p. 182.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Returning
    to the present case, ss. 159 and 160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> empower a
    court to correct errors in the register with the proviso that rectification is
    “[s]ubject to any estates or rights acquired by registration under this Act”. Contrary
    to the view of the motion judge, this proviso is not engaged on the facts of
    this case. Here we are confronted with an acknowledged surveying error in
    describing the boundaries of a right of way and not with the quality of title
    conferred by a registered instrument. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    pause to note that the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Boundaries Act</span></em><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span>does not define the term “boundary”. Nor is
    the term defined in other Ontario legislation. David W. Lambden, O.L.S., and
    Izaak de Rijcke, O.L.S., give the following definition in their essay,
    “Boundarie<span style='line-height:200%'>s”, in <em>Survey Law in Canada</em> (Agincourt, Ont.: The Carswell Co. Ltd., 1989), at §4.01</span>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A boundary is the line of division between two parcels of land.
    It is a limiting line; by it is ascertained the extent of parcels in separate
    ownership or subject to different rights.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>These authors observe, at §4.72, that “the limits of
    easements are boundaries in every sense of the word.” I agree with the authors’
    view that the term is not limited to the boundaries of separately owned
    parcels, but also applies to the boundaries of an easement, including a right
    of way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    registration of the transfer to Ms. Salo of Parts 1, 4 and 6, Plan 53R-50717,
    subject to a right of way over Part 4, Plan 53R-10717, did not have the legal effect
    of granting an indefeasible, unencumbered interest in the portion of the land
    that the appellant surveyors mistakenly showed on the R-Plan as being within
    Part 6 instead of Part 4. The description of the registered land provided by
    Part 4, which is referenced in the registered transfers to the parties in the
    action, is not conclusive as to the boundaries or the extent of the land, as confirmed
    by s. 140(2) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    this case, the appellants admittedly failed to draw the boundaries of an
    existing gravel road that was intended to become a right of way in accordance
    with the owner’s specifications. The boundaries of the right of way are not
    inalterably defined by the misdescribed boundaries on the R-Plan. The
    legislative scheme of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> does not guarantee
    boundaries. The language of ss. 159 and 160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> confers
    jurisdiction on the court to correct the boundaries of Part 4 on the R-Plan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied that there is no injustice in ordering the rectification of the
    register in this case. It is clear that all of the parties, including the
    Salos, believed that the plaintiffs had the benefit of the right of way for
    purposes of accessing their respective properties and that this right of way
    was delineated by the gravel road that crossed the Salos’ property. It was not
    until 2007 – some 15 years after purchasing the property – that the Salos
    learned that Part 4 on the R-Plan does not accurately reflect the location of
    the roadway as it existed on the ground when they purchased the property. Indeed,
    if there is a risk of injustice, it would be if rectification were not ordered
    in these circumstances. </p>
  <h1>F.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conclusion and Disposition </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court’s powers of rectification under ss. 159 and 160 of the <i>Land Titles Act</i> are qualified by reference to the indefeasibility of title that follows from
    registration. A purchaser only obtains the benefit of indefeasible title if he
    or she is a <i>bona fide </i>purchaser for value without notice. This continues
    to be the law in Ontario, despite any suggestion to the contrary by the motion
    judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the instant case, however, the question whether the respondent, Ms. Salo, had
    actual notice of an interest in land that varied from the registered interest
    before she purchased the property does not need to be answered to decide
    whether the court may invoke the rectification provisions in ss. 159 or 160 of
    the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. The request for rectification concerns an
    admitted surveying error in showing the location of a right of way on a reference
    plan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast with a registered instrument, the deposit on title of a reference plan
    does not itself create an interest in land triggering s. 78(4) of the<i> Land
    Titles Act</i>. Section 140(2) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em> provides that
    the description of registered land is not conclusive as to the boundaries or
    the extent of land. The deposit of the R-Plan and the reference to Part 4 in
    the legal description in the registered transfers does not create an interest
    in land precluding the statutory remedy of rectification.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would thus allow the appeal from the motion judge’s order dismissing the
    appellants’ request for rectification. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining issue is that of the appropriate terms of a remedial order. The
    appellants and the OBA did not specify whether the remedy in this case should
    be ordered pursuant to s. 159 or s. 160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, but instead</span></em> referred to these
    provisions interchangeably. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    159 contemplates an order for rectification of the register as a consequence of
    a court deciding that a person is entitled to an estate, right or interest in
    registered land. Section 160 provides for a right to apply to rectify the
    register where a person is aggrieved by an entry thereon. In my view, s. 160 of
    the <em>Land Titles Act</em> is the more pertinent provision given that the
    issue on the motion concerned the court’s jurisdiction to rectify a deposited reference
    plan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    the appellants nor the OBA provided specific guidance as to how to best fashion
    a remedial order that is consistent with the Land Titles scheme.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants handed up to the court a copy of a sketch that was before the motion
    judge. This sketch – titled “Sketch Showing Proposed Right of Way Realignment
    to Fit Existing Centreline” – is attached as Appendix B to these reasons. The sketch
    illustrates how the R-Plan would need to be corrected if rectification were
    granted. As depicted on the sketch, the width of Part 4 remains as it was in

    to s. 160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, I would order the appellants to
    correct Reference Plan 53R-10717 in the manner shown on the sketch in Appendix
    B. The appellants shall deliver a copy of the order of this court and the
    corrected version of Reference Plan 53R-10717 in a form and content that is
    satisfactory to the Land Registrar. Upon receipt, the Registrar shall make any
    entry on the parcel registers for the affected properties as he or she deems
    necessary to give effect to the order for rectification of Reference Plan
    53R-50717 in accordance with these reasons. If necessary to give effect to this
    order, the Examiner of Surveys shall certify the correction in accordance with
    these reasons.</p>

    have brought the motion for rectification, no issue was taken with the
    appellant surveyors’ carriage of the motion, presumably as agents of the
    plaintiffs. In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs’ prayer for relief
    requests an order to rectify the register for land titles in accordance with s.
    160 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. Even though the plaintiffs are seeking this
    relief, counsel for the appellants advised the court that the motion judge
    directed the appellant surveyors to bring the motion for rectification.</p>
