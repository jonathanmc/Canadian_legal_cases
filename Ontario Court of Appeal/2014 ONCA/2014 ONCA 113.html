  <p><strong>Sharpe J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Exchange Corporation Canada Inc. (“Exchange”), provides
    foreign currency exchange, insurance, and other travel-related services from
    kiosks at Pearson International Airport. The respondents, the Corporation of
    the City of Mississauga (“Mississauga”) and the Municipal Property Assessment
    Corporation (“MPAC&quot;), assessed Exchange as a “tenant” of the respondent
    Greater Toronto Airports Authority (“GTAA”) for municipal realty taxes under
    the <em>Assessment Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. A.31. Exchange brought this
    application for a declaration that it is not a “tenant” within the meaning of
    the <em>Assessment Act </em>and therefore not liable for municipal realty
    taxes. Exchange also sought a declaration that if it is liable, the premises
    are to be assessed at a more favourable rate as an “eligible property” under
    the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em>S.O.
    2001, c. 25.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge concluded that Exchange was a licensee, not a
    tenant, and granted a declaration to that effect. He rejected Exchange’s
    submission that if it were a tenant, the premises it occupies would qualify as
    an “eligible property”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court allowed the respondents’ appeal, concluding that
    the application judge had erred in law in finding that Exchange was not a
    tenant, and dismissed Exchange’s cross-appeal, concluding that the application
    judge had properly rejected Exchange’s claim for favourable treatment as an
    eligible property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange appeals, with leave, to this court. For the following reasons I
    would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>STATUTORY CONTEXT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Municipalities in Ontario have the power to collect realty taxes from
    owners of property within their borders pursuant to the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>.
    Property owned by the federal government is exempt from taxation under s. 125
    of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pearson Airport is owned by the federal government. However, in the
    1990s, the federal government decided to privatize the operations of its airports
    and, in 1996, the federal government leased Pearson Airport to the GTAA for a
    period of 60 years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By virtue of s. 3(1)(24) of the <em>Assessment Act</em>, “[l]and owned
    or leased by a designated airport authority” is exempt from realty tax provided
    the designated airport authority makes payments in lieu of taxes (“PILT”) to
    the municipality. The GTAA is a designated airport authority and it makes PILTs
    to Mississauga.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The designated airport authority exemption does not apply to any portion
    of the airport leased by a tenant: s. 3(1)(24)(iv). Generally, tenants are not
    liable for municipal realty taxes in Ontario. However, by virtue of s. 18(1)(a)
    of the <em>Assessment Act</em>, “the tenant of land owned by the Crown shall be
    assessed in respect of the land as though the tenant were the owner if rent or
    any valuable consideration is paid in respect of the land”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, if Exchange is a “tenant of land owned by the Crown”, it is
    liable to municipal realty taxes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    1(1) of the <em>Assessment Act</em> defines a tenant to include “an occupant
    and the person in possession other than the owner”.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE EXCHANGE – GTAA AGREEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange
    has the right to operate its kiosks at Pearson Airport by virtue an agreement
    with the GTAA dated June 24, 2003 (the “Agreement”). The Agreement is a lengthy
    document that was the subject of detailed consideration by both the application
    judge and the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement is called a “lease”. It refers to the GTAA as the “Landlord” and to Exchange
    as the “Tenant”. The Agreement provides for the payment of rent. It contains
    the standard habendum clause, a covenant for quiet possession and expressly
    states in s. 13.8 that it does not “create any relationship between the
    Landlord and the Tenant other than the relationship of landlord and tenant”.
    The Agreement also contains many provisions giving the GTAA control over the
    manner in which the premises are used.</p>
  <p class=Heading>DECISION OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange’s
    primary position before the application judge was that it was a tenant of the
    GTAA, not a “tenant of land owned by the Crown” and therefore not liable for
    municipal realty taxes. The application judge rejected that argument. That
    finding was not appealed to the Divisional Court and Exchange advances no
    argument on the point before this court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge invited submissions as to whether the contractual arrangement
    between the GTAA and Exchange made Exchange a “tenant” or a mere licensee. He
    concluded that the terms of the Agreement did not meet the test for a tenancy.
    The application judge focussed on the controls reserved by the GTAA under the Agreement
    regarding the use of the space which Exchange occupied. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    controls which the application judge found to be decisive may be summarized as
    follows. The landlord retains the right to: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>terminate the lease on 60 days’ notice to accommodate the
    re-development of the Airport; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>approve signs and advertising visible from the outside of the
    leased premises;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>require the tenant to discontinue any business conduct or
    practice which may harm the landlord’s business or reputation;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>require the tenant to occupy and use the premises in accordance
    with the specified uses of selling insurance, foreign currency and related uses
    and not to direct business elsewhere;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>impose limits on prices charged by the tenant;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>require the tenant to operate during specified hours;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>access the premises for inspection and repairs;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>approve alterations to the premises;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>control access to the Airport and Terminal Building;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>relocate the tenant to other premises in the terminal if
    necessary for operational or re-development purposes;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>consent to an assignment of the lease (consent must not be
    unreasonably withheld).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that these controls deprived Exchange of the rights
    of a tenant, meant that the Agreement was not a lease but a “concession
    agreement” and made Exchange a mere licensee. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge then considered whether Exchange was an “occupant”, which
    would bring it within the statutory definition of a “tenant”. He concluded that
    because of the significant controls the GTAA exercised over the activities
    carried out on the subject property, Exchange was not an occupant and that even
    if Exchange were an occupant, the GTAA exercised “paramount occupancy” and
    Exchange was therefore not liable to pay realty taxes as an “occupant”.</p>
  <p class=Heading>DECISION OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court found that the application judge had erred in law by
    concluding that Exchange was not a “tenant”. In the view of the Divisional Court,
    the application judge erred by focussing on certain provisions and by failing
    to consider the Agreement as a whole. In particular, the application judge
    failed to consider several central and important provisions that are indicative
    of a tenancy. These included the fact that the Agreement calls itself and takes
    the form of a lease, the clause granting Exchange the right to “peaceably
    possess and enjoy the Leased Premises for the Term without interruption by the
    Landlord,” and a clause assuring Exchange “the benefit of a good and sufficient
    leasehold interest in the Lands, sufficient to permit the grant by the Landlord
    to the Tenant of the leasehold interest contemplated by this lease.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering
    the document as a whole the Divisional Court concluded that “[t]he provisions
    of the lease are unambiguous. The intention of the parties is clear. The
    interpretation of the document is a question of law. The Application Judge
    failed to correctly apply the law.” The court also held that the application
    judge erred in failing to find that Exchange was also liable to taxation as an
    “occupant” of the property.</p>
  <p class=Heading>ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange
    submits that the Divisional Court erred by:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying correctness as the standard of review and failing to defer to
    the application judge’s finding that Exchange was a licensee, not a tenant;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finding that Exchange was a “tenant”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failing to defer to the application judge’s finding that Exchange was
    not an occupant and that the GTAA was the paramount occupant;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failing to find that Exchange’s premises should be assessed as an
    “eligible property” under the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>. </p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standard of review </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am unable to accept the submission that the Divisional Court should have
    deferred to the application judge’s finding that Exchange is a licensee and not
    a tenant and that it erred by applying the standard of correctness to the issue
    of whether the Agreement was a lease. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not necessary to engage in a lengthy examination of this court’s jurisprudence
    on the standard of review that applies to the interpretation of a contract: see <em>Bell Canada v. The Plan Group </em>(2009), 96 O.R. (3d) 81 (C.A.); <em>MacDougall
    v. MacDougall</em> (2005), 262 D.L.R. (4th) 120 (Ont. C.A.).  As the Divisional
    Court observed, at para. 18, this was not a case involving disputed facts, nor
    was it a case where the interpretation of the contract required consideration of
    and findings as to the underlying factual matrix. The issue of whether Exchange
    is a tenant turned solely on the interpretation of the language of the
    Agreement and on an assessment of the legal character of the relationship it
    created: did the Agreement, in law, constitute Exchange as a tenant or as a
    licensee?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Divisional Court identified clear legal errors on the part of the application
    judge. He failed to consider the Agreement as a whole and he failed to consider
    provisions in the Agreement which on application of the proper legal test, as we
    review below, made the Agreement a lease and Exchange a tenant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court did not err in the standard of review.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was Exchange a “tenant”?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Divisional Court noted, at para. 30, the application judge focussed almost
    exclusively on the impact of the GTAA’s reserved rights and failed to consider
    the Agreement as a whole. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge failed to consider or to give sufficient weight to the legal
    effect of the habendum and quiet enjoyment clauses as well as several other
    features of the Agreement that were important indicators of a lease, including
    the following: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the Agreement specifically states that it constitutes the

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the GTAA covenanted that it enjoyed the benefit of a leasehold

    interest contemplated by the lease;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the Agreement “is a completely carefree absolutely net lease to

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Divisional Court that when the Agreement is considered as a
    whole, its provisions are “unambiguous”.&nbsp; The intention of the parties is
    clear.&nbsp;Indeed, Exchange admitted that it was a tenant when it brought the
    application on the basis that it was a tenant of the GTAA and not a tenant of
    the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Agreement did contain significant reservations of rights to the GTAA, when
    considered in the context of the lease as a whole, those rights were consistent
    with Exchange’s legal status as a tenant. The rights reserved by the GTAA are
    similar to those commonly found in commercial leases. This court has found reservations
    of such rights to be consistent with the degree of exclusive possession
    required to constitute the legal status of tenant: see <em>Metro-Matic Services
    Ltd. v. Hulmann</em> (1973), 4 O.R. (2d) 462 (C.A.); <em>Re British American
    Oil Co. Ltd. and DePass </em>(1959), 21 D.L.R. (2d) 110 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Divisional Court did not err in concluding that Exchange is a
    “tenant” and therefore liable to municipal realty taxes.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Divisional Court err by failing to defer to the application
    judge’s finding that Exchange was not an occupant and that the GTAA was the
    paramount occupant?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have concluded that Exchange is a “tenant”. That is sufficient to render
    Exchange liable for municipal realty taxes. It is therefore unnecessary for me
    to consider the alternate submission advanced by the respondents that even if
    Exchange is a licensee, it meets the extended statutory definition of “tenant” which
    includes “an occupant and the person in possession other than the owner”. I
    agree with the Divisional Court, at para. 40, that as Exchange is a tenant and
    therefore the only entity that occupies or uses the leased premises and as the GTAA
    is a landlord and does not use or occupy the leased premises, the issue of
    paramount occupancy does not arise. </p>
  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should Exchange’s premises be assessed as an “eligible property”?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange
    submits that if it is liable to municipal realty taxes, it is entitled to the favourable
    treatment accorded to an “eligible property” under s. <span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>331</span> of the <i><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Municipal Act</span>,
    2001</i>.  The eligible property provision was introduced to alleviate what
    might otherwise have been excessive tax increases resulting from the change to a
    system of assessment based on market value. If a property qualifies as an
    “eligible property”, its taxes are limited to the average effective level of
    taxation derived from up to six comparable properties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    331(20) defines “eligible property” as a property</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>(a)   to
    which subsection 329 (7) applies,</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>(b)   that
    ceases to be exempt from taxation for 2001 or thereafter,</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>(c)   that
    was subdivided or was subject to a severance,</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>(d)   whose
    classification changes for 2001 or a later year, or</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>(e)   that
    is prescribed by the Minister of Finance</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the application judge and the Divisional Court rejected Exchange’s submission
    that its premises met the definition of “eligible property”. I agree with that
    conclusion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    before the Divisional Court and before this court, Exchange failed to identify
    a category enumerated in the definition of “eligible property” that applies to
    its premises.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Category
    (a) does not apply for the reasons explained by the Divisional Court at paras.
    53-54. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    property was not subdivided so as to trigger the application of (c). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange
    conceded before both the application judge and the Divisional Court that the
    classification of the property did not change as required by (d). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    property was not prescribed by the Minister of Finance as required by (e).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange
    appeared to focus its submissions on category (b) – that the property ceased to
    be exempt from taxation when the GTAA leased the premises to Exchange and
    Exchange became liable to pay taxes as a tenant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the submission of Mississauga and the MPAC that the word “property” in
    s. 331(20) must refer to the entire airport property and not to the individual
    premises leased by Exchange: see<em> Curtis Properties (Bridgeland) Inc. v.
    Toronto (City)</em>, [2006] O.J. No. 4115 (S.C.). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    airport property was exempt from taxation prior to the lease to Exchange and it
    remained exempt after the lease took effect. The assessment of a tenant under
    s. 18(1) of the <em>Assessment Act</em> does not create a separate “property”
    within the meaning of s. <span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>331</span> of the <i><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Municipal Act</span>,
    2001<em>. </em></i>As both the application judge and the Divisional Court observed,
    O. Reg 73/03, ss. 28, 29 set out the specific process and formula for the
    calculation of taxes where a portion of a parcel ceases to be exempt. If
    Exchange’s argument were to be accepted, those provisions would be unnecessary
    and Exchange does not meet their requirements.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exchange’s
    argument essentially rested on what it perceives as the unfairness or inequity
    of the rate at which it is taxed when compared with the rates of its
    competitors. As this court held in <em>Yonge Street Hotels Ltd. v. Municipal Property
    Assessment Corp., Region No. 9</em> (2005), 197 O.A.C. 11 (C.A.), at para. 24,
    “[w]e are not at liberty to overcome or ignore legislative distinctions by
    applying some free-standing principle of fairness.” To benefit from the
    treatment accorded to “eligible property”, a party must fit within one of the
    categories identified by the legislature and Exchange has failed to satisfy
    that essential requirement.</p>
  <p class=Heading>DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents fixed at the agreed
    amount of $31,000, inclusive of disbursements and taxes. </p>
