  <p class=Heard>Heard: February 7, 2014</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the
    conviction entered on October 3, 2011 by Justice M. Rocheleau of the Ontario
    Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault. The issue at
    trial was credibility. The complainant testified that the appellant forced her
    to have sex. The appellant testified that they did have sex but that it was
    consensual. The appellant submits that the complainants evidence contained
    many inconsistencies and that the reasons given by the trial judge for
    accepting her evidence and rejecting his evidence are inadequate and reveal
    legal error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is often the case in a busy trial court where oral reasons for
    judgment are given, the trial judges reasons in this case are not ideal.
    However, despite the able argument presented by Ms. Trehearne, we are not
    persuaded that appellate intervention is called for in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While standing on their own, the problems with the appellants evidence
    identified by the trial judge were far from compelling, they did carry some
    weight.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept the submission that the trial judge engaged in the type
    of forbidden reasoning discussed in <em>R. v. Maharajah </em>(2004), 186 C.C.C.
    (3d) 247 at para. 30: I accept the evidence of the complainant; the
    complainants evidence differs from the evidence of the accused on material
    matters; therefore, I do not believe the evidence of the accused and I find
    that the Crowns case is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As pointed out in <em>R.
    v. J.J.R.D. </em>(2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d)] 252 at para. 53: [A]n outright
    rejection of an accuseds evidence based on a considered and reasoned
    acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of conflicting credible evidence provides
    a proper basis for rejecting the accuseds evidence provided that the trial
    judge goes on to consider whether, notwithstanding her rejection of the
    accuseds evidence, it raises a reasonable doubt. No reversal of the onus of
    proof takes place in such circumstances. In the present case, the trial judge
    did not simply proceed directly from finding that the complainant was credible
    to concluding that the allegations were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Earlier
    in her reasons, the trial judge recited the <em>R. v. (W.D.) </em>formula and,
    reading her reasons as a whole, we are satisfied that she proceeded through the
    three stages of analysis and found that on all the evidence the Crown had
    proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge offered several reasons for accepting the complainants
    evidence. While the appellant impugned each reason, we see no need to address
    each one individually and will only make brief comment. In particular, the
    trial judge found that when the complainant returned to her friends at the
    Subway restaurant following her brief visit to the appellants apartment, she
    was in a state of upset and distress. It was open to the trial judge to
    conclude that the complainants demeanor within minutes of the encounter at the
    apartment was entirely inconsistent with the appellants claim that they had
    engaged in consensual sex and that when the complainant left his apartment she
    was not upset.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that when she went to the complainants
    apartment she was menstruating. She testified that she thought the appellant had
    removed the tampon she was using before he sexually assaulted her. The
    appellant testified that the complainant had removed the tampon from her vagina
    before they engaged in consensual sex. When she was examined at the hospital, a
    tampon was found in her vagina. The complainant testified that she had no other
    tampon with her and had not replaced it. The trial judge accepted this evidence
    and concluded that the complainant was mistaken in thinking the appellant had
    removed the tampon. On this evidence, it was open to the trial judge to
    conclude that if the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse she
    herself would have ensured that the tampon that was later found in her vagina
    at the hospital had been removed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to inconsistencies in the complainants
    evidence. It was for the trial judge to decide what weight to give to the
    cumulative effect of the inconsistencies. The trial judge concluded that given
    the considerable period of time that had passed between the incident and the
    trial, the complainants evidence was nonetheless reliable on the central issue
    of consent. It was open to her to do so. The verdict was not unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
