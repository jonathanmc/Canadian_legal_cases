  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Gillese

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises significant questions about the scope of an estate
    trustees power to mortgage property governed by the <em>Land Titles Act</em>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5.</p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adalgisa Di Michele died on September 5, 1996, leaving behind her three
    sons: Roberto, Michele and Antonio. Under Mrs. Di Micheles will (the Will),
    Antonio was named the estate trustee.  Because the three brothers have the same
    last names, I will refer to each of them by their first names.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Will provided that after all debts had been paid, Mrs. Di Micheles
    estate was to go, in equal shares, to those of her issue alive at the date of
    distribution.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 21, 2002, in his capacity as estate trustee, Antonio registered
    a Transmission by Personal Representative to take title to the family home that
    his mother had owned and lived in until her death.  The home was located at 269
    Angelene Street, Mississauga, Ontario (the Property) and is within the land
    titles system.  By that point, all the estate debts had been paid and it was
    ready for distribution.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roberto and Michele never registered on title any interest in, or claim
    to, the Property.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Starting in 2002, Antonio was embroiled in personal litigation with 909403
    Ontario Limited, Marsica Investments Ltd., Cesidio Ranieri and Alberto Ramelli
    (collectively Marsica or the respondents).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 2008, Antonio put up the Property as security in favour of Marsica
    by means of a mortgage (the Mortgage).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2010, Marsica obtained judgment for $1.5 million against Antonio.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2011, Marsica brought an application in which it sought to have the Property
    sold.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roberto (the appellant) lived with his parents on the Property for
    many years prior to their deaths.  He and his wife have continued to live on
    the Property until the present time.  He says that he and his brothers agreed
    that after their mothers death, the Property would be his.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roberto brought a counter-application, disputing Marsicas right to sell
    the Property and asserting sole entitlement to it.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By judgment dated February 6, 2013 (the Judgment), among other things,
    the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> declared that the Property vested in Antonio, Roberto and         Michele
    on March 21, 2002, in equal one-third shares;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> declared the Mortgage to be valid;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> ordered the partition and/or sale of the Property in          accordance
    with the interests of the parties entitled to share in     it; and </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> dismissed Robertos counter-application.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roberto appeals.  He asks this court to set aside the Mortgage and that
    part of the Judgment giving relief under the <em>Partition Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.4, and order that he replace Antonio as the estate trustee.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marsica cross-appeals, arguing that the trial judge erred in finding
    that the Mortgage binds only Antonios one-third interest in the Property.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part and allow
    the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Will </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key provisions in Mrs. Di Micheles Will are set out below.  As will
    become evident, the breadth of the power to postpone sale given to the estate
    trustee is significant to the resolution of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I GIVE, DEVISE AND BEQUEATH all of my estate, both real and
    personal,  unto my Trustee upon the following trusts, namely:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>a)  To pay all my just debts, funeral expenses and testamentary
    expenses ;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>b)   To pay out of the residue of my estate all [duties and
    taxes];</p>
  <p class=CQuote>c)   <b><i>To deliver all the rest and residue of my estate
    then remaining to my issue alive at the date of distribution in equal shares
    per stirpes</i></b>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT the provisions of this my Will, <b><i>I give
    my Trustee power to sell</i></b>, call in <b><i>and</i></b> <b><i>convert into
    money</i></b>, <b><i>all of my estate at such time or times, in such manner and
    upon such terms as my Trustee in his discretion may decide upon, with power and
    discretion to postpone such conversion</i></b> of such estate or any part or
    parts thereof, <b><i>for such length of time</i></b> <b><i>as he may think best</i></b>,
    and I hereby declare that <b><i>my Trustee may retain any portion of my estate
    in the form in which it may be at my death  for such length of time as my
    Trustee in his discretion may deem advisable,</i></b> without responsibility
    for loss, to the intent that investments or assets so retained shall be deemed
    to be authorized investments for all purposes of this my Will. [Emphasis
    added.]          </p>
  <p class=Heading>Antonio Acts as Estate Trustee  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 16, 1997, Antonio obtained a Certificate of Appointment of
    Estate Trustee with a Will. The estates only asset was the Property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 21, 2002, the Property was transferred to Antonio by
    Transmission by Personal Representative.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Property had been the Di Michele family home for several decades. 
    The parents of the Di Michele brothers lived on the Property until their
    deaths.  The father died in 1987 and the mother in 1996.  The mother gained
    title to the Property on her husbands death.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the Property transfer to Antonio, he signed a certificate
    confirming that all the estate debts had been paid.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The 2002 action against Antonio</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2002, Marsica commenced an action against Antonio in connection with
    a failed real estate investment scheme (the 2002 action).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial date was scheduled for March 31, 2008.  In the weeks leading up
    to trial, it appeared that the matter would settle on the basis of a payment
    over time secured by a mortgage from Antonio over his cottage property in Bala,
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Antonio's lawyer, Avrum Slodovnick (Slodovnick) told Marsicas lawyer
    Simon Schonblum (Schonblum) that the settlement was 99% completed and that Antonio
    was just waiting for the blessing of his financial advisor. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The estimated length of the trial was 10 days.  On the basis that the
    parties were so close to a settlement, counsel agreed to vacate the trial date. 
     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after the trial date was vacated, Schonblum searched title for
    the Bala cottage property and found that Antonio had registered a $350,000.00
    mortgage against it on April 4, 2008, thereby exhausting the remaining equity
    in the property. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Antonio seeks adjournment of 2002
    action and grants the Mortgage </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 4, 2008, a pre-trial conference was held in relation to the 2002
    action.  At that point, the trial was scheduled to proceed on June 16, 2008. 
    Antonio sought an adjournment of the trial because he did not have his
    financial evidence in order.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faced with yet another possible delay in the trial and in light of Antonio
    having encumbered the Bala cottage property after having offered it to Marsica as
    security, Marsica was concerned about securing funds for a possible judgment in
    the 2002 action.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A suggestion was made that Antonio might provide mortgage security in
    exchange for an adjournment so that Antonio could provide further documents and
    obtain a forensic accounting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were caucusing separately.  At one point, Slodovnick pulled
    Schonblum out of his room and said that Antonio had given him instructions to
    mortgage the Property as security for any judgment that might follow trial.  In
    exchange, Marsica was to consent to an adjournment to allow Antonio to obtain a
    forensic accounting.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Slodovnick then showed Schonblum a parcel register for the Property.  On
    the face of the parcel register, under Owners Names, it said Antonio Di
    Michele. Under Capacity were the initials TWW, which stand for Trustee With
    a Will.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties ultimately reached an agreement, under the terms of which: Marsica
    agreed to adjourn the trial; Antonio granted security for any judgment that
    might arise in relation to the 2002 action by means of a blanket mortgage of
    $350,000.00 on the Bala cottage property and the Property; and the parties
    agreed to jointly retain a forensic accountant and split the cost of a review
    of further productions from Antonio of the books and records relating to the
    real estate investment (the Agreement).  The parties were to return for a
    further pre-trial conference in November 2008.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting on the judgment obtained in the 2002 action, the respondents obtained
    a writ of seizure and sale.  They filed the writ against the Property with the
    Sheriff in the Peel region.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff posted a notice at the Property that there would be a
    sheriffs sale.  Roberto and his wife were living in the house. Roberto had
    lived at the Property while his parents were alive and continued living there
    after their deaths.  By the time of trial, he had lived on the Property for
    some 50 years.  He claimed that after his mothers death, he and his brothers
    had agreed that the Property would be his.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robertos lawyer wrote to counsel and the Sheriff to advise that he
    would be bringing an application to assert his interest in the Property.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Application and
    Counter-Application</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents brought an application in which they sought, among other
    things, the sale of the Property.  Roberto brought a counter-application in
    which he asserted sole ownership of the Property.  He sought, among other
    things, an order directing Antonio to transfer the Property to him and
    appointing him in Antonios stead as the estate trustee.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two matters were converted into trials and heard together.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Michele took no position and filed no documents.  Antonio
    appeared on his own behalf.  He denied knowledge of the Will, his appointment
    as the estate trustee, and that the Property had been transmitted to him.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>THE TRIAL DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected Antonios evidence, stating that he was a most
    unreliable and deceptive witness.  She rejected his claim that someone else applied
    for the Certificate of Estate Trustee with a Will in his name and then
    registered the transmission of the Property to him as estate trustee without
    his knowledge.  She found that Antonio was aware of the Will, of his
    appointment as estate trustee, and that the Property had been registered in his
    name as estate trustee.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge set out the parties positions on the many issues that
    had been raised.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She then analysed and rejected Robertos arguments that the Mortgage was
    fraudulent and invalid because Antonio had given it and he had no interest in
    the Property.  She concluded that while Antonio was not forthright about the
    nature of his interest in the Property  that he held title only as estate
    trustee and that he shared beneficial interest in the Property with his two
    brothers  this alone did not place him within the bounds of fraud as defined in
    s. 1 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>.  Antonio was the registered owner of the
    property, he was not posing as a fictitious person, and there was no forgery.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also rejected Robertos argument that Antonio had no
    property interest in the Property when he gave the Mortgage, though she did not
    conclude that Antonio owned the whole Property.  In her view, the Property automatically
    vested in the estates beneficiaries (the three brothers), three years after
    Mrs. Di Micheles death, pursuant to s. 9 of the <em>Estates Administration Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 22.  As a result, rather than owning the whole Property as
    estate trustee, Antonio owned only the third of the property to which he was
    beneficially entitled under the Will.  The trial judge took note of s. 10 of
    the <em>Estates Administration Act</em>, which provides that nothing in s. 9
    derogates from a power granted to an estate trustee in a will.  She concluded
    that although the Will gave the estate trustee the power to sell the Property and
    to postpone such sale for such length of time as he deems advisable, this did
    not evidence a clear intent to oust s. 9 and delay the vesting of the estate.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the Mortgage was valid.  However, because
    she found that the brothers beneficial interests in the Property had vested by
    the time that Antonio granted the Mortgage in 2008, she concluded that Antonio
    could only have granted a mortgage against his interest in the Property.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge further found that because the 2002 action was against
    Antonio personally, and not in his capacity as the estate trustee, he could
    only give as security that which he owned in his personal capacity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the trial judge found the Mortgage to be enforceable only
    against Antonios one-third interest in the Property.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She then ordered partition or sale of the Property in accordance with
    the interests of the parties entitled to share in it.</p>

  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS </p>
  <h2>     1. Was the Mortgage valid?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes three arguments going to the validity of the
    Mortgage.  First, he submits that Antonio had no interest in the Property,
    either personally or in his capacity as estate trustee, over which he could
    grant a mortgage.  Second, he argues that the respondents were not <i>bona fide </i>purchasers for value without notice.  Third, he says that the lawyers
    involved at the time that the Mortgage was granted were unaware that Antonio
    was not the legal owner of the Property.  Consequently, he contends, the Mortgage
    was a product of Antonios fraudulent representation that he was the owner of
    the Property and, therefore, is a nullity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not accept any of these submissions. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Did
    Antonio have an interest in the Property?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants first submission  that Antonio had no interest in the
    Property  cannot stand in light of the relevant statutory provisions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2(1) of the <em>Estates Administration Act</em> provides that
    upon a persons death, all of that persons property vests in the estate
    trustee: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><i>All real</i></b> <b><i>and personal</i></b> <b><i>property
    that is vested in a person</i></b> without a right in any other person to take

    intestate and despite any testamentary disposition, <b><i>devolves to and

    to the payment of the person's debts and so far as such property is not
    disposed of by deed, will, contract or other effectual disposition, it shall be
    administered, dealt with and distributed as if it were personal property not so
    disposed of. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 120 of the <i>Land Titles Act</i>, on Mrs. Di Micheles
    death, the land registrar was entitled, upon receiving an application from the
    estate trustee, to register the estate trustee as owner in place of the
    deceased:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><i>On the death of the sole registered owner</i></b> or of the survivor of several joint registered owners <b><i>of freehold land,

    subject to an appeal to the Divisional Court in the prescribed manner by any
    person aggrieved by an order of the land registrar under this section.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 63 of the <em>Land Titles Act</em><i> </i>provides that in
    respect of registered dealings with land, the person registered in the place of
    a deceased owner is in the same position as if that person had taken the land
    under a transfer for valuable consideration:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><i>Any person registered in the place of a

    trusts and for the purposes to which the same is applicable by law and subject
    to any unregistered estates, rights, interests or equities subject to which the
    deceased owner held the same, but otherwise in  all  respects,  <b><i>and  in

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of these provisions, it is clear that Antonio had the legal
    right to grant the Mortgage.  The Property vested in him, as the estate
    trustee, on his mothers death: <em>Estates Administration Act</em>, s. 2(1)<i>.  </i>He was entitled to be registered as owner of the Property in his mothers
    stead: <em>Land Titles Act</em>, s. 120.  He had the Property transferred into
    his name.  He was thereafter the person registered in the place of his mother,
    the deceased owner: <em>Land Titles Act</em>, s. 63.  The Mortgage was a
    registered dealing with the Property.  Antonio was in the same position as if
    he had become the registered owner of the Property under a transfer for
    valuable consideration: <em>Land Titles Act</em>, s. 63.  A registered owner
    has the right to grant a mortgage over his or her land: <em>Land Titles Act</em>,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong>Accordingly, it cannot be said that Antonio had no
    interest in the Property that entitled him to grant the Mortgage.    <strong><span

  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='line-height:normal'><strong><span style='font-family:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to this submission, I begin by noting that the questions of
    value and consideration were not raised before the trial judge.  Issues ought
    not to be raised for the first time on appeal.  In any event, however, the
    contention that the respondents were not <i>bona fide </i>purchasers for value
    without notice must fail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first question is whether the respondents were <em>bona fides</em><i> </i>when they took the Mortgage.  In my view, the fact that Antonios lawyer
    offered the mortgage as security eliminates any question of a lack of <i>bona
    fides</i>.  Because Antonios lawyer offered the Property as security, the
    respondents were entitled to operate on the assumption that Antonio was acting
    lawfully in granting the Mortgage.  They were not obliged to go behind that
    implicit representation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next question is whether the respondents gave value for the
    Mortgage.  This, too, is easily disposed of.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mortgage was granted as part of the Agreement.  In exchange for the
    Mortgage, the respondents agreed to adjourn the trial and share the cost of the
    forensic accountant that Antonio required.  Even if the adjournment alone does
    not constitute value within the meaning of the term <em>bona fide</em><i> </i>purchaser
    for value without notice, the cost of the forensic accountant borne by the
    respondents clearly does.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn next to the question of notice.  <i> </i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant points to the fact that the Property register shows
    Antonio as holding the Property in the capacity of TWW, meaning Trustee With
    a Will.  He says that this shows that the respondents had actual notice of the
    Will.  Accordingly, he says, the respondents could not have simply accepted the
    Mortgage as security  they had to first inquire into whether Antonio could
    lawfully mortgage the Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject this argument.  In my view, s. 62(2) of the <em>Land
    Titles Act </em>provides a complete answer to it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is correct that when the parties entered into the Agreement, they were
    aware that Antonio held the Property as estate trustee. As the appellant points
    out, the lawyers for both parties had the parcel register in hand at that time
    and the parcel register showed Antonio as owner but in the capacity of TWW (Trustee
    With a Will).    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, s. 62(2) of the <i>Land Titles Act</i> provides that: (1) describing
    the owner of land as a trustee shall be deemed <b>not</b> to constitute notice of
    a trust, and (2) the description (of the owner as trustee) does <b>not</b> impose a duty on the person dealing with the owner to make inquiry as to the power
    of the owner in respect of the property.  Section 62(2) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><i>Describing the owner of</i></b> freehold or
    leasehold <b><i>land</i></b> or of a charge <b><i>as a trustee</i></b>, whether
    the beneficiary or object of the trust is or is not mentioned, <b><i>shall be
    deemed not to be a notice of a trust</i></b> within the meaning of this
    section, <b><i>nor shall such description impose upon any person dealing with
    the owner the duty of making any inquiry as to the power of the owner in
    respect of the land or charge</i></b> or the money secured by the charge, or
    otherwise, <b><i>but, subject to the registration of any caution or inhibition,
    the owner may deal with the land or charge as if such description had not been
    inserted. </i></b>[Emphasis added.]<b><i> </i></b> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, Antonios description as TWW (Trustee With a Will) is deemed not
    to be notice of a trust and it imposed no duty on the respondents to make any
    inquiry as to his power as owner to charge the Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, s. 62(2) provides that the owner may deal with the land as if
    the description as a trustee had not been inserted.  This is subject to the registration
    of any caution or inhibition.  However, in the present case, no caution or
    inhibition had been registered on the title to the Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would reject the appellants contention that the
    respondents were not <i>bona fide </i>purchasers for value without notice.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='line-height:normal'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Were the Lawyers operating under a misapprehension that Antonio was the
    owner?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the evidence about the parcel register, the appellants
    contention that the parties were all labouring under a misapprehension that
    Antonio was the owner of the Property must fail and with it, his argument that
    the Mortgage was obtained by fraud on Antonios part.  In this regard, the
    appellant has confused the notion of a fraudulent transaction with a valid
    transaction that might amount to a breach of trust.  The former may invalidate
    the transaction.  The latter does not.  Rather, it gives rise to an action by
    the beneficiaries against the trustee.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While Roberto and Michele may have recourse against Antonio for what
    appears to be a breach of his obligations as the estate trustee, that does not
    mean that the Mortgage was granted fraudulently nor does it render the Mortgage
    invalid.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss this ground of appeal.   </p>
  <h2>     2. Were the respondents entitled to a remedy under the <em>Partition
    Act</em>?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that even if the Mortgage were valid, an order
    under the <em>Partition Act</em><i> </i>could not be made because Marsica does
    not have a crystallized right of possession.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marsica concedes this point.  However, it contends that the end result of
    enforcement of the Mortgage will be such an order and the relief ordered
    pursuant to the <i>Partition Act </i>was an attempt by the trial judge to save
    the parties the cost and trouble of going through the intermediate steps
    relating to foreclosure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marsica is likely correct about the trial judges motivation in ordering
    partition and sale.  However, the law is clear: only persons entitled to the
    immediate possession of an estate in property may bring an action or make an

  <h2>     3. Should Roberto be appointed Estate Trustee in Antonios stead?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his counter-application, Roberto asked to be appointed as the estate
    trustee in Antonios stead.  The trial judge did not address this aspect of his
    counter-application.  Roberto renews his request in this court, saying that
    Antonio and Michele do not claim any interest in the estate and have shown
    that they have no interest in receiving a share of the estate.  Roberto also
    states that Antonio gifted his share of the estate to him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 37(1) of the <i>Trustee Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23, empowers
    the court to remove a personal representative (which is another term for an
    estate trustee)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> and appoint some other proper person.  Section 37(1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>The Superior Court of Justice may remove a personal
    representative upon any ground upon which the court may remove any other
    trustee, and may appoint some other proper person or persons to act in the
    place of the executor or administrator so removed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court will remove an estate trustee only if doing so is clearly
    necessary to ensure the proper management of the trust: <i>Re Weil</i>, [1961]
    O.R. 888 (C.A.), at p. 889.  Situations in which removal may be justified
    include where the estate trustee has acted in a way that has endangered the
    trust property or otherwise shown a lack of honesty, proper capacity, or
    reasonable fidelity: <em>Letterstedt v. Broers</em> (1884), 9 A.C. 371 (P.C.),
    at pp. 385-86; <em>Bathgate v. National Hockey League Pension Society</em> (1994), <span class=canliicitation>16 O.R. (3d) 761 (C.A.), at p. 778.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, on the record, it appears that there may be good reason to remove Antonio
    as the estate trustee.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in my view, Roberto is not a proper person to serve as his
    replacement.  I say this because Robertos personal interests would seriously
    conflict with the obligations he would undertake as the estate trustee. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, a person will not be appointed as a trustee if that
    persons duties as trustee would conflict with either his or her personal
    interests or duties which that person has undertaken apart from as trustee: see <em>Re Parsons</em>, [1940] Ch. 973, at p. 983; <em>Re Moorhouse</em>, [1946] 4
    D.L.R. 542 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 544; and <i>Re Becker </i>(1986), 57 O.R. (2d)
    495 (Surr. Ct.), at pp. 498-99.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two examples illustrate why Robertos appointment as replacement estate
    trustee would run afoul of the general rule precluding those in a conflict
    position from being named estate trustee.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first example flows from the estate trustees overriding obligation
    to duly administer the estate.  As the legal owner of the Property, the estate
    trustee will have to comply with the court orders flowing from these
    proceedings, including those relating to the Mortgage.  However, the record
    makes it plain that Roberto claims the Property as his own and that he plans on
    appropriating the Property for himself.  Rather than respecting and
    implementing the court orders in respect of the Property, it seems likely that
    he will resist all actions associated with enforcement of the Mortgage.  In any
    event, his personal interests would be in conflict with his duties as the
    estate trustee in this regard.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second example flows from the successor estate trustees obligation
    to take steps to recover, for the estate, any losses caused by the prior estate
    trustees defaults: see <em>Bennett v. Burgis</em><i> </i>(1846), 5 Hare 295
    (Ch.), at p. 297.  This would require Roberto, if he were appointed the
    successor estate trustee, to consider taking action against Antonio for any losses
    that Antonio may have caused the estate in his capacity as the initial estate
    trustee.  But, it will be recalled, Roberto claims that Antonio made a gift to
    him of his interest in the estate.  So, if Roberto <i>qua </i>estate trustee
    found that he ought to pursue Antonio, would he have to consider attacking the
    gift?  It is self-evident that in such a situation, Robertos obligation if he were
    the estate trustee would conflict with his personal interests.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add that the foregoing examples stand apart from the
    respondents contention that the alleged gift from Antonio to Roberto of his
    interest in the estate was for the purpose of defeating, hindering or avoiding
    a creditor.  By virtue of accepting the gift of Antonios interest, Roberto
    would be complicit in such an act.  Thus, this allegation also raises serious
    questions about whether Roberto is a proper person to serve as estate trustee.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>
  <h2>     4. Did the Mortgage bind the entire Property?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that although the Mortgage was valid, it was
    binding only on the one-third share that she found Antonio was entitled to
    receive as a beneficiary under the Will.  In reaching this conclusion, the
    trial judge relied on s. 9 of the <i>Estates Administration Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 9 of the <em>Estates Administration Act</em> reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><i>Real property not</i></b> disposed of, conveyed
    to, divided or <b><i>distributed among the persons beneficially entitled
    thereto</i></b> under section 17 by the personal representative <b><i>within
    three years after the death of the deceased</i></b> <b><i>is </i></b> <b><i>thenceforth
    vested in the persons beneficially entitled thereto under the will</i></b> 
    unless such personal representative, if any, has signed and registered, in the
    proper land registry office, a caution in Form 1 ... [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge saw that the Will gave Antonio, as estate trustee, an
    unqualified power to postpone sale of the Property.  Nonetheless, in her view, there
    is no clear intention in the Will that  Anthony have discretion beyond three
    years to distribute the estate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, pursuant to s. 9 of the <em>Estates Administration Act</em>,
    the trial judge found that the Property vested in the beneficiaries three years
    after Mrs. Di Micheles death, in the same manner as if the estate trustee had
    conveyed it to them.  On this view, the vesting occurred before the Mortgage
    was granted.  Therefore, the Mortgage could attach only to Antonios one-third
    beneficial interest in the Property.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I do not agree.  In my view, the Mortgage is binding on
    the whole of the Property.  I reach this conclusion for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, s. 9 of the <em>Estates Administration Act</em> does not apply in
    the circumstances of this case.  Section 9 (and its predecessors) was not enacted
    to limit the powers given to an estate trustee under a will.  Rather, it was intended
    to give estate trustees additional powers, but only to the extent that the additional
    powers do not conflict with the provisions of the will.  The intention of the
    deceased, as expressed in his or her will, is always paramount: <em>Re Leblanc</em> (1978), 18 O.R. (2d) 507 (C.A.), at pp. 513-15. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This can be seen from s. 10 of the <em>Estates Administration Act</em>,
    which provides that nothing in s. 9 derogates from any right possessed by a
    trustee under the will.  Section 10 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>Nothing
    in section 9 derogates from any right possessed by an executor or administrator
    with the will annexed under a will or under the Trustee Act or from any right
    possessed by a trustee under a will. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    paramountcy of the testators intention is confirmed in the jurisprudence.  Where
    a will gives the estate trustee a power to sell property at such times and in
    such manner as the estate trustee sees fit, s. 9 of the <em>Estates
    Administration Act</em><i> </i>will not limit the scope of that power by
    requiring that the property vest after a specific period of time: <em>Re
    Proudfoot Estate</em> (1994), 3 E.T.R. (2d) 283 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at paras. 8
    and 11-12, vard on other grounds (1997), 19 E.T.R. (2d) 150 (Ont. C.A.).  See
    also <em>Re Leblanc</em>, at p. 515.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    will be recalled that the Will gave Antonio, as estate trustee, the power to sell
    the Property at such time or times, in such manner and upon such terms as my
    Trustee in his discretion may decide upon.  It went on to expressly provide
    that the estate trustee could postpone sale:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>for such length of time as he may think best, and I hereby
    declare that my Trustee may retain any portion of my estate in the form in
    which it may be at my death  for such length of time as my Trustee in his
    discretion may deem advisable...</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a plain reading of these provisions in the Will, the estate trustee was given
    the power to postpone sale of the Property for whatever length of time he
    deemed advisable.  Thus, in my view, the trial judge erred in finding that the
    Will contained no clear intention that Antonio had the discretion to delay
    selling the Property beyond the three year limit in s. 9 of the <em>Estates
    Administration Act</em>.  Consequently, s. 9 did not apply and the Property did
    not vest in the beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the beneficiaries entitlement under the Will did not amount to a property interest
    in the Property.  The Will does not give the beneficiaries a specific bequest
    of the Property.  Rather, it gives them a contingent interest in the residue of
    the estate.  In this regard it will be recalled that the Will provided that the
    residue of the estate was to go to Mrs. Di Micheles issue alive at the date
    of distribution. Accordingly, to become entitled, a beneficiary had to be
    alive on the date of distribution.  Until distribution, the beneficiaries had
    only a contingent beneficial interest in the residue of the estate, as well as
    the personal right to compel the estate trustee to duly administer the estate.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    contingent beneficial interest in an estate does not give rise to a property
    interest in any specific asset of the estate, prior to or absent an
    appropriation of such asset to the beneficiary by the trustee: <em>Spencer v.
    Riesberry</em>, 2012 ONCA 418, 114 O.R. (3d) 575, at para. 37.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    estate had not been distributed at the time that the Mortgage was granted. 
    Therefore, the beneficiaries contingent interests in the residue had not
    vested.  Hence, Antonio did not have a one-third interest in the Property at the
    time of the Mortgage.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    pursuant to s. 93(3) of the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, the Mortgage was
    registered free from any unregistered interest of the beneficiaries.  Section
    93(3) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>The charge, when registered, confers upon the chargee
    a charge upon the interest of the chargor as appearing in the register subject
    to the encumbrances and qualifications to which the chargors interest is
    subject, but free from any unregistered interest in the land.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    Ontarios land titles system, the rights of a <i>bona fide </i>purchaser (which
    includes a mortgagee) for value who has registered its interest in the property
    trump any prior unregistered interests in the property: <em>719083 Ontario
    Limited v. 2174112 Ontario Inc.</em>, 2013 ONCA 11, <span class=documentbody>28
    R.P.R. (5th) 1, </span>at para. 12; <em>MacIsaac v. Salo</em>, 2013 ONCA 98,
    114 O.R. (3d) 226, at para. 39. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, as I have already explained, the respondents were <i>bona
    fide</i> purchasers for value without notice.  They registered their interest
    (the Mortgage) in the Property.  Their interest would trump those with a prior
    unregistered interest in it.  Therefore, even if the beneficiaries had an
    interest in the Property that pre-existed the granting of the Mortgage, that
    interest was unregistered and therefore was trumped by the registered Mortgage.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the Mortgage binds the entire Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    I would allow the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal in part and delete the references in the Judgment to
    relief under the <em>Partition Act</em>.  I would allow the cross-appeal and,
    therefore, delete para. 2 of the Judgment.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant succeeded only in respect of the second issue, which the respondents
    had conceded and which occupied a very small part of the appeal.  In all other
    respects, the respondents were successful.  Accordingly, I would order costs in
    favour of the respondents, fixed at $13,500, all inclusive.</p>
