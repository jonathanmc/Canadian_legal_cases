  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the dangerous offender designation and the
    indeterminate sentence imposed by Justice Célynne S. Dorval of the Ontario Court
    of Justice, dated January 23, 2003.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Cronk J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>A.      Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is an admitted and prolific child sex offender.  On
    October 24, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 16 sex-related offences involving
    numerous children, mostly young girls, between the ages of four and twelve. 
    Most of these offences involved the appellants accosting a child in a public
    place (in a park, school or outside a residence) and taking the child to a
    private location where the appellant sexually abused the child.  Occasionally,
    the appellant would ask his victim to urinate in his presence.  On two
    occasions, the appellant abducted children in a vehicle.  He also repeatedly
    sexually abused his girlfriends young daughter, including by attempting
    intercourse with her on one occasion when she was eight or nine years of age. 
    Throughout these abusive incidents, the appellant threatened to kill the
    complainant, as well as her mother and brother.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After pleading guilty to the predicate offences, the appellant admitted
    to sexually offending against about 100 children.  In addition, while he was
    detained in custody prior to sentencing, the appellant telephoned approximately
    175 young girls between the ages of eight and twelve, pretending to be a radio
    disc jockey who was involved in running a contest.  Using this ruse, he engaged
    the young girls in sexually specific conversations and asked some of them to
    touch themselves sexually while he was on the phone with them.  He also asked
    some of the girls to urinate so that he could hear it.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 23, 2003, Dorval J. of the Ontario Court of Justice
    designated the appellant as a dangerous offender and imposed an indeterminate
    sentence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>B.      Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  First, he argues that the
    sentencing judge erred in assessing whether there is a reasonable possibility
    of the eventual control of his risk to the public in the community, by
    conflating the prospects for the eventual control of his risk in the community
    with the issue whether he could be cured.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, relying on fresh evidence that he seeks to file on appeal with
    leave of this court, the appellant submits that the sentencing judge and
    counsel at the sentencing hearing proceeded on a false understanding of the
    science regarding the prospects for effective treatment of offenders who, like
    the appellant, suffer from psychopathy.  Based on his fresh evidence, the
    appellant contends there has been a sea change in medical knowledge regarding
    treatment for psychopaths and that, contrary to the expert evidence accepted by
    the sentencing judge, effective psychological treatment now exists for such
    offenders, including him.  The appellant says that, viewed through the lens of
    this fresh evidence, his risk of reoffending can be adequately managed in the
    community and, therefore, his designation as a dangerous offender amounts to a
    miscarriage of justice.  He seeks a new sentencing hearing or, in the alternative,
    the imposition of a determinate period of detention, followed by a 10-year supervision
    order.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>C.      Discussion</p>
  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Risk Reduction Versus Risk Elimination</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the sentencing judge erred in the manner in
    which she assessed whether he should be declared a long-term as opposed to a
    dangerous offender by confusing the issue of his treatability  that is, the possibility
    of control or reduction of his risk in the community by means of effective
    treatment  with the question whether he could be cured within the period of
    a definite sentence or a definite sentence and a maximum 10-year supervision
    order.  In effect, the appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred by
    conflating the concepts of risk reduction and risk elimination.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of this argument, the appellant points to the last paragraph
    of the sentencing judges reasons, which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[The appellant] cannot be cured.  I am satisfied that the Crown
    has established that there is no reasonable likelihood that he will be
    controlled in the community following a determinate sentence.  I therefore find
    that his conduct is intractable.  He meets all criteria at sections 753(a) and
    (b) [<em>sic</em>] and must be sentenced to an indeterminate period of
    incarceration.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept that this passage from the sentencing judges lengthy
    reasons demonstrates the error urged by the appellant.  I say this for the
    following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    753.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,<em> </em>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, sets out
    specific criteria for the designation of an offender as a long-term offender. 
    The section reads:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The court may, on application made under this Part following
    the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find an offender
    to be a long-term offender if it is satisfied that</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a) it would be
    appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more for the
    offence for which the offender has been convicted;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b) there is a
    substantial risk that the offender will reoffend; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) there is a
    reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no suggestion that the sentencing judge failed to consider whether the
    appellant should be designated as a long-term offender.  She did address this
    issue when considering the Crowns dangerous offender application, as she was
    obliged to do: <em>R. v. Johnson</em>, 2003 SCC 46, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357.  Rather,
    the issue is whether the sentencing judge erred in her interpretation of the
    third criterion for the designation of an offender as a long-term offender 
    the requirement under s. 753.1(1)(c) for a showing of a reasonable possibility
    of eventual control of [an offenders] risk [of reoffending] in the community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Johnson</em>, the Supreme Court considered the purpose and inter-relationship
    of the dangerous and long-term offender provisions of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
    The court stated, at paras. 29 and 30:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he dominant purpose of preventive detention is to protect
    the public when the past conduct of the criminal demonstrates a propensity for
    crimes of violence against the person, and there is a real and present danger
    to life or limb.  Absent such a danger, there is no basis on which to sentence
    an offender otherwise than in accordance with the ordinary principles of
    sentencing.  <em>The principles of sentencing thus dictate that a judge ought
    to impose an indeterminate sentence only in those instances in which there does
    not exist less restrictive means by which to protect the public adequately from
    the threat of harm, i.e., where a definite sentence or long-term offender
    designation are insufficient.</em>  <em>The essential question to be
    determined, then, is whether the sentencing sanctions available pursuant to the
    long-term offender provisions are sufficient to reduce this threat to an acceptable
    level, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in s. 753(1) have been met</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>In order for the sentencing sanctions available pursuant to
    the long-term offender provisions to reduce the threat associated with an
    offender who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria to an acceptable level</em>,
    it must be possible for the same offender to satisfy both the dangerous
    offender criteria and the long-term offender criteria. [Citations omitted; emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court continued, at para. 32:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>The very purpose of a long-term supervision order, then, is
    to protect society from the threat that the offender currently poses</em>  and
    to do so without resort to the blunt instrument of indeterminate detention.  <em>If
    the public threat can be reduced to an acceptable level</em> through either a
    determinate period of detention or a determinate period of detention followed
    by a long-term supervision order, <em>a sentencing judge cannot properly
    declare an offender dangerous</em> <em>and sentence him or her to an
    indeterminate period of detention</em>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court elaborated on the meaning of a reasonable possibility of
    eventual control of the risk in the community, at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>If a sentencing judge is satisfied</em> <em>that the
    sentencing options available under the long-term offender provisions are
    sufficient to reduce the threat to the life, safety or physical or mental
    well-being of other persons</em> <em>to an acceptable level</em>, the
    sentencing judge cannot properly declare an offender dangerous and thereupon
    impose an indeterminate sentence, even if all of the statutory criteria have
    been satisfied.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the sentencing judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Courts
    decision in <em>Johnson</em>, which was released after the date of the
    sentencing judges ruling on the Crowns dangerous offender application.  However,
    the sentencing judge did consider the British Columbia Court of Appeals
    decision in <em>R. v.</em> <em>Johnson</em>, 2001 BCCA 456, 158 C.C.C. (3d) 155
    (the BC <em>Johnson</em> Decision), which was eventually upheld by the
    Supreme Court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the sentencing judge quoted extensively from the BC <em>Johnson</em> Decision. 
    She stated in part as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I have reviewed the case law provided to me on this issue.  In
    [the BC <em>Johnson</em> decision], the BCCA made an extensive comparison of
    the dangerous offender provisions as they existed prior to and post amendment. 
    It concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>In summary then, the <em>dangerous offender designation</em> under the new provisions <em>is designed to ensure that those offenders who are
    truly dangerous, whose behaviour is unlikely to be modified or controlled, will
    be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence</em> for the highest degree of state
    control.  <em>An offender whose conduct or behaviour is not pathologically
    intractable, in the sense that the offender can at least reach a stage where,
    though not curable, he or she can be safely controlled in the community and who
    would likely have been found to be a dangerous offender under the former
    provisions, may now qualify for long-term rather than dangerous offender status</em>. 
    This offender would have at least the possibility, when the offender is no
    longer a risk to the community, to one day be free of state control.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge went on to outline the criteria to be met by the Crown in
    order to establish that an accused is a dangerous offender.  In so doing, she again
    quoted from the BC <em>Johnson</em> Decision:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Crown must establish: </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) The pattern of conduct is pathologically intractable,
    otherwise defined in [the BC <em>Johnson</em> decision] as deep-seated or
    difficult to cure.  <em>Evidence of possible treatment control or cure must be
    considered</em> in this analysis.  In the words of Justice Ryan in [the BC <em>Johnson</em> decision]:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>if an offender is likely to be cured of his or her
    condition within the parameters of the appropriate determinate sentence, the
    condition cannot be said to be intractable and he or she ought not to be
    declared a dangerous offender.  <em>If the offender may not be cured, but may
    be controlled in the community within the limits defined by a long-term
    offender sentence, the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender,
    but a long-term offender instead</em>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    closing paragraph of the sentencing judges reasons, relied on by the appellant
    and set out above, must be understood in the context of the entirety of her
    reasons, including her comments concerning the BC <em>Johnson</em> Decision. 
    In the excerpts from that decision referenced by the sentencing judge, the
    court clearly stated that only those dangerous offenders whose behaviour is
    unlikely to be safely modified or controlled in the community should be subject
    to an indeterminate sentence as a dangerous offender.  Conversely, those
    offenders whose risk can be adequately managed in the community should be declared
    long-term offenders.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judges references to the BC <em>Johnson</em> Decision confirm that
    she appreciated that the statutory criteria for a long-term offender
    designation are directed at the possibility of eventual control of an
    offenders risk of reoffending through the managed reduction, rather than the
    elimination, of that risk.  In my view, in light of these references, the
    appellants contention that the sentencing judge conflated the concepts of risk
    reduction and risk elimination is unsustainable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    factors also support the conclusion that the sentencing judge was alert to the
    distinction between, and did not conflate, the prospects for reduction of the
    appellants risk of reoffending in the community and his potential to be cured. 
    She reviewed additional authorities, <em>R. v. Guilford</em>, [1999] O.J. No.
    4894 (Sup. Ct.) and <em>R. v. Payne</em>, 41 C.R. (5th) 156, [2001] O.J. No.
    146 (Sup. Ct.), which emphasize the distinction between risk reduction  the
    focus of s. 753.1(1)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>  on the one hand, and
    risk elimination, on the other hand. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, in her reasons, the sentencing judge reviewed the expert psychiatric
    evidence concerning the appellants diagnosis, his risk of reoffending, and the
    opinions of the involved psychiatrists regarding treatment of psychopathic
    individuals, including, specifically, the appellant.  When discussing this
    expert evidence, the sentencing judge dealt directly with the expert opinions
    concerning the appellants risk of reoffending and their conflicting views
    about the prospects for effectively managing or reducing that risk in the
    community, discussed in detail below.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nowhere
    in the sentencing judges review of this evidence does she suggest that the
    appellant could be designated as a long-term offender only if his mental
    disorders could be cured, or if his risk of sexually reoffending could be
    eliminated or reduced to zero.  To the contrary, as I read her reasons, the
    sentencing judge remained focused throughout on the evidence bearing on the
    prospects for reducing the appellants risk of reoffending to an acceptable
    level in the community.  She was right to do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the plain language of the concluding paragraph of the sentencing judges
    reasons, quoted above, itself belies the error alleged by the appellant.  This
    paragraph tracks certain of the language used in the BC <em>Johnson</em> Decision.  For example, the sentencing judge found that the appellant cannot be
    cured and that his conduct is intractable.  This language draws on similar
    terminology used in the BC <em>Johnson</em> Decision: see <em>e.g.</em> at
    para. 93.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same paragraph of her reasons, the sentencing judge alluded to the risk
    reduction criterion for the designation of an offender as a long-term
    offender.  She held: I am satisfied that the Crown has established that there
    is no reasonable likelihood that [the appellant] will be <em>controlled in the
    community</em> following a determinate sentence (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the sentencing judges detailed reasons are read as a whole, I have no
    hesitation in concluding that she did not lose sight of the important
    distinction between the prospects for reducing or controlling the risk of the
    appellants reoffending and the potential for the complete elimination of that risk
    by reason of a medical cure for his disorders.  It follows that I see no error
    in her appreciation of the statutory criteria for the designation of an offender
    as a long-term offender, or in her finding that there was no reasonable
    possibility that the appellants high risk of reoffending could be controlled
    in the community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fresh Evidence</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two fresh evidence applications before the court, one brought by the
    appellant, and one brought by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants proposed fresh evidence consists of a report, dated July 8, 2008,
    by Dr. Louis Morissette, a forensic psychiatrist at Philippe-Pinel Institute in
    Montreal, prepared approximately five and one-half years after the appellants sentencing
    hearing, together with the transcript of the Crowns cross-examination of Dr.
    Morissette on the content of his report.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his evidence, Dr. Morissette addresses three main issues: the appellants
    amenability to treatment; pharmacological and therapeutic treatment for persons
    suffering from psychopathy; and the prospects for eventually controlling the
    appellants risk of reoffending in the community.  I will discuss his opinions
    on these issues later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on Dr. Morissettes opinions, the appellant contends that the sentencing judge
    erred in her assessment of his prospects for effective treatment and, hence, in
    concluding that his risk of reoffending could not eventually be safely reduced
    or controlled in the community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown resists the appellants fresh evidence application on the grounds that
    Dr. Morissettes opinions lack probative value in the circumstances and, when
    taken with the other evidence at the appellants sentencing hearing, could not
    reasonably be expected to have affected the result at that hearing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the second fresh evidence application, the Crown seeks leave to file the Parole
    Board of Canadas 2006 to 2012 decisions regarding the appellant.  The
    appellant does not oppose the Crowns application.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='page-break-after:avoid'><em>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em><em>Psychiatric Evidence at Sentencing Hearing</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    import of the appellants fresh evidence must be assessed in the context of the
    expert psychiatric evidence adduced before the sentencing judge. Evidence from
    three psychiatrists was tendered at the appellants 2002 sentencing hearing.  First,
    Dr. John Bradford, a Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Forensic
    Service at the Royal Ottawa Hospital, conducted a sexual behaviours assessment
    of the appellant in mid-March 2001.  Dr. Bradford did not testify at the
    appellants sentencing hearing.  However, his report, dated August 29, 2001,
    was admitted into evidence and considered as part of the evidentiary record at
    the hearing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    during a two-month period in late 2001, Dr. Phillip Klassen, Deputy Clinical
    Director of the Law and Mental Health Program at the Centre for Addiction and
    Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, conducted a court-ordered assessment of the
    appellant under s. 752.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  His report, dated
    February 12, 2002, was filed with the sentencing judge and Dr. Klassen
    testified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the defence retained Dr. John Fedoroff, also a forensic psychiatrist and
    practising physician at the Royal Ottawa Hospital, to conduct a psychiatric
    assessment of the appellant.  His report, dated August 31, 2002, was before the
    sentencing judge and he also testified at the sentencing hearing.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Underline>The appellants diagnosis and risk
    of reoffending</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no material dispute among these experts regarding the appellants
    diagnosis.  It was common ground that the appellant suffers from an antisocial
    personality disorder (with narcissistic personality traits), sexual paraphilias
    of heterosexual pedophilia and urophilia (a sexual deviation involving arousal
    at the contact of urine), and substance abuse disorders.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> 
    The experts also agreed that the appellants sex drive is very high, he is
    deceitful and manipulative, and he is a psychopath.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    there was little difference of opinion among the psychiatric experts concerning
    the appellants risk of reoffending.  Dr. Klassen and two of his colleagues at
    CAMH scored the appellant at 31 out of 40 on the Psychopathy Checklist 
    Revised (the PCL-R), a test designed to assess behaviours and personality
    traits relating to psychopathy.  According to Dr. Klassen, a score of 40 on the
    PCL-R represents the prototypical psychopath.  Dr. Bradford scored the
    appellant at 30.5 out of 40.  Dr. Fedoroff did not conduct his own PCL-R or
    other phallometric or empirical testing on the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants high PCL-R scores indicate that he is in the top 20 percentile of federal
    penitentiary offenders with respect to psychopathic behaviour.  His scores
    stand in marked contrast to the average PCL-R score for child sex offenders,
    which Dr. Klassen described as being much lower  in the range of 16 or 17. 
    They also indicate that the appellant is at significant risk of violent or
    sexually violent recidivism, thus raising challenges for his effective
    treatment and supervision in the community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants scores on other empirically-based risk assessment instruments (the
    Sex Offender Risk Appraisal Guide or SORAG and the STATIC 99) were also
    high.  According to both Drs. Klassen and Bradford, these scores suggested a
    strong correlation with recidivism and a medium to high risk of future violent
    or sexual reoffending by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the appellants test results, Dr. Klassen offered the opinion that the
    appellants long-term risk of violently or sexually reoffending is high, that
    his risk period will span several decades, that the severity of his reoffending
    would be proportionate to the presenting circumstances, and that, without aggressive
    monitoring and supervision, his sexual reoffences will likely involve multiple
    victims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Bradford viewed the appellant as being at medium to high risk of sexually
    reoffending.  He described the appellants risk of recidivism as substantial,
    and noted in his report: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]t is clear that there have been serious problems as already
    outlined, and specifically concerns over the abduction of children and the
    potential, very serious consequences that might arise.  This escalation in his
    history is of serious concern.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Fedoroff did not diminish the risk posed by the appellant.  He accepted Dr.
    Bradfords and Dr. Klassens risk assessments.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='page-break-after:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span
class=Underline>Potential for eventual risk control</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core area of disagreement among the experts concerned the potential for
    the eventual control of the appellants risk of reoffending in the community. 
    The experts opinions on this issue focused on the appellants treatment
    prospects or treatability.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen regarded the appellant as a poor candidate for treatment given his
    clinical risk factors and his PCL-R scores.  In his opinion, administration of
    a powerful testosterone-reducing drug  Lupron  might reduce the appellants
    risk of reoffending but vigorous external controls (strict community
    supervision) would also be required.  However, he also stated that, given the
    appellants history of unreliable self-reporting and a highly unstable
    lifestyle, even the consistent administration of a long-acting sex-drive
    reduction drug may prove problematic.  In Dr. Klassens view, the appellants
    psychopathy, his paraphilias, his history of association with antisocial peers,
    his involvement in a criminal lifestyle, and his limited education and
    vocational skills were indicators of when, not whether, he would reoffend.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen recommended that the appellant not receive any psychologically-based
    sex offender treatment.  In his opinion, the appellants diagnosis of
    psychopathy would make it difficult, if not impossible, to treat him
    psychologically.  Dr. Klassen also stated that there was a growing body of
    evidence in the forensic psychiatric and psychological literature suggesting that
    offenders with high PCL-R scores not only do not benefit from psychological
    treatment but also may, in fact, recidivate sooner and more frequently after
    such treatment.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Bradford offered a different opinion concerning the appellants treatability.  He
    noted that the appellant had not been treated in the past for his disorders and
    suggested that, although there is a substantial risk he will reoffend, there
    is also a reasonable possibility that he could be treated by a combination of
    pharmacological and psychological methods.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Fedoroffs opinion on the appellants treatability was similar to that of Dr.
    Bradford.  He agreed that anti-androgen medication would be expected to reduce
    the appellants sex drive.  If this occurred, in his opinion, it would be
    expected to have a significant effect on the likelihood of the appellants
    sexually reoffending.  According to Dr. Fedoroff, because a sustained course of
    anti-androgen medication had never been tried with the appellant, it was
    difficult to assert that he was untreatable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was also evidence before the sentencing judge regarding the appellants
    response to prior trial treatment efforts.  While under the care of Dr.
    Bradford at the Royal Ottawa Hospital, the appellant received an anti-androgen
    drug called Cyproterone Acetate (CPA) and sertraline (also known as Zoloft).<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> 
    The appellant reported a decrease in sexual interest in female children and
    fantasies while receiving CPA.  In Dr. Bradfords opinion, the appellants
    results on follow-up phallometric testing showed that his deviant sexual
    interest in female children and his arousal responses in relation to pedophilia
    were decreased by the medication.  Drs. Klassen and Fedoroff stated that repeat
    phallometric testing does not provide a reliable means for measuring response
    to treatment or predicting future offending behaviour.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    experts stressed that reliable self-reporting by an offender is key to effective
    treatment.  Dr. Klassen expressed concern regarding the appellants self-reported
    claims of reductions in his sex drive.  In his view, the appellants history of
    unreliable self-reporting and his potential for manipulation, among other
    factors, suggested that his sex drive did not drop significantly while he was
    receiving CPA.  Dr. Fedoroff acknowledged that, according to the appellants own
    self-reports, the appellant was still actively fantasizing about sexual contact
    with female children and masturbating, as often as two to three times per day,
    while he was receiving CPA.  Dr. Fedoroff agreed that there was no significant
    reduction in the appellants sexual preoccupation and masturbation as a result
    of the CPA.  As well, during this medication trial, the appellant reportedly
    told nursing staff that he experienced little change in his sexual interest. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge reviewed the evidence of the appellants predicate offences,
    his background circumstances, the impact of his offences on his youthful
    victims, and his sexually inappropriate conduct while in custody (his numerous
    telephone calls to young girls while posing as a disc jockey).  She also
    addressed the psychiatric evidence regarding the appellant, in detail.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge accepted the unanimous expert evidence regarding the nature of
    the appellants illnesses and his high risk to reoffend.  She found that his
    conduct while detained  <em>i.e.</em>, engaging young girls by telephone in
    sexually explicit conversations  combined with his phallometric test scores,
    described above, confirmed the high probability of his recidivism.  She also
    accepted Dr. Klassens evidence that the severity of the appellants
    reoffending would be proportional to the presenting opportunities, and that it
    will likely involve multiple victims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge dealt directly with the conflicting expert opinions concerning
    the potential for effective treatment of the appellant and, hence, the
    prospects for reducing his risk of reoffending in the community.  In so doing,
    she considered the appellants scores on the tests administered by Drs. Klassen
    and Bradford, the results of his trial period of anti-androgen therapy at the
    Royal Ottawa Hospital, the likely effectiveness of pharmacological and
    psychological treatments, and the appellants demonstrated history of
    unreliable self-reporting.  She accepted Dr. Klassens evidence of the lack of
    established effective treatments for psychopaths, and his opinion that if treated
    pharmacologically, the appellants sex drive may be lowered.  She went on to
    note the absence of evidence as to the extent of any sex drive reduction that
    such medication might achieve, the evidence that the appellant was not
    motivated to change, and the appellants lack of insight into the consequences
    of his actions.  She also noted Dr. Klassens testimony that a small number of
    studies have reported higher recidivism rates for psychopaths after
    psychological treatment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge placed little weight on Dr. Fedoroffs evidence.  She
    expressly rejected his opinion that without proof of failed treatment
    (treatment followed by a reoffence), the appellant could not be viewed as
    untreatable.  She observed that, based on Dr. Fedoroffs evidence, only a
    failure of the proposed treatment will show that [the appellant] is
    untreatable, even if that leads to the possible or probable offence on a
    child.  In the sentencing judges view, this stance did not take into account
    the risk of serious harm to others should treatment of the appellant fail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge accepted Dr. Klassens opinion that multiple factors suggested
    an inability to control the appellants risk in the community.  These included:
    his multiple paraphilias; his inability to suppress his sexual impulses; the
    depth of his psychopathy (his anti-social personality disorder); his history of

    lifestyle; his limited education; his lack of empathy and deceitfulness; his

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on all these factors, the sentencing judge held:</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span

    the result, the sentencing judge concluded that the Crown had met its burden to
    establish that there is no reasonable likelihood that [the appellant] will be
    controlled in the community following a determinate sentence.  Accordingly,
    she declined to exercise her discretion to impose a long-term offender
    designation, instead declaring the appellant a dangerous offender and imposing
    an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment.</p>

    Morissette does not challenge many key aspects of the expert evidence at the

    He also accepts that the appellant has a history of a criminal lifestyle; that
    he acts superficially; that he is unhesitatingly manipulative; that his sexual
    offences were chronic; and that, at the time of the hearing, he was at high
    risk of reoffending.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are, however, three aspects of Dr. Morissettes proposed evidence upon which
    the appellant seeks to rely in aid of his claim that a new sentencing hearing
    is required.  It is Dr. Morissettes opinion that: (1) at the time of the
    appellants sentencing hearing, the positive factors supporting the conclusion
    that there was a reasonable possibility of controlling his risk of reoffending
    in the community outweighed the negative factors supporting a contrary conclusion,
    thus justifying the appellants designation as a long-term offender; (2)
    contrary to Dr. Klassens evidence, medical studies and experience after the
    date of the appellants sentencing hearing suggest that psychopaths can be
    effectively treated; and (3) the appellant has benefitted from pharmacological
    and therapeutic treatments since his sentencing hearing, demonstrating that he
    is amenable to treatment and change, and that his risk of reoffending can be
    managed in the community.</p>

    this case, the Crown does not challenge the due diligence, reliability and
    credibility components of the <em>Palmer</em> test  only the fourth <em>Palmer</em> criterion is in issue.  It is the Crowns position that Dr. Morissettes
    evidence lacks probative value and, if it had been before the sentencing judge,
    it could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result at the
    sentencing hearing.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Lévesque, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in the context of the admission
    of fresh evidence on appeal, the concepts of admissibility and probative value
    overlap.  The court explained, at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To be admissible, it is not sufficient that the fresh evidence
    meet the prerequisite of relevance.  It must also be credible and <em>such that
    it could, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
    have affected the result</em>.  Accordingly, the probative value of the fresh
    evidence must, to some degree, be reviewed by a court of appeal when it is
    determining the admissibility of the fresh evidence. The question to be
    considered was expressed as follows by McIntyre J. in <em>Palmer</em>:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>If presented to the trier of fact and believed, would the
    [fresh] evidence possess such <em>strength or probative force</em> that it

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn first to Dr. Morissettes opinion that, at the time of the
    appellants sentencing hearing, the positive factors militating in favour of the
    conclusion that there was a reasonable possibility of controlling his risk in
    the community outweighed the factors supporting a contrary conclusion.  In my
    view, there is no basis for admitting Dr. Morissettes opinion on this issue as
    fresh evidence on appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his report, Dr. Morissette listed a series of considerations that he described
    as positive factors regarding the possibility that the [appellants] risk of
    reoffending could be manageable or acceptable in the community.  He also
    listed what he termed negative factors bearing on this critical issue.  He
    then expressed the following opinion:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As of 2002, my opinion is that the positive factors are more
    preponderant and my opinion is that there was a reasonable possibility that
    [the appellant] could have been controlled in the community.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Reading the file since 2003 confirms that impression.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    make three points.  First, the considerations identified by Dr. Morissette 
    both positive and negative  were part of the evidentiary record before the
    sentencing judge.  None of them constitutes new or previously unknown
    information. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Dr. Morissettes opinion on this issue is not fresh  it simply represents a
    concurring expert opinion to those offered by other experts at the sentencing
    hearing.  Recall, for example, Dr. Bradfords opinion that there was a
    reasonable possibility of containing the appellants risk in the community
    through a combination of pharmacological and psychological treatment.  Dr.
    Fedoroff said much the same thing, emphasizing the risk-reduction features of
    anti-androgen medication (pharmacological treatment).  The sentencing judge
    considered and rejected these opinions, as she was entitled to do.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Smith</em> (2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 154 O.A.C. 51 (C.A.), at para.
    71, Simmons J.A. of this court made the following instructive comments
    regarding the admission of a concurring expert opinion as fresh evidence on
    appeal:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where proposed fresh evidence consists of a concurring expert
    opinion, it may be excluded either because of an absence of due diligence or
    because the interest of justice in finality of criminal proceedings forecloses
    its admissibility.  Ultimately what is required is an assessment of whether
    the concurring opinion raises new considerations with sufficient potential to
    impact the verdict such that the interests of justice require its admission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    comments are apposite here.  Dr. Morissettes opinion that the positive
    factors regarding the possibility that the appellants risk of reoffending
    could be controlled in the community outweighed the countervailing negative
    factors adds nothing to this issue that was not before the sentencing judge. 
    His opinion is only a further voice on one side of the risk containment debate
    regarding the appellant.  I am not persuaded that his opinion on this issue, if
    it had been before the sentencing judge, would have affected the result at the
    appellants sentencing hearing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I would stress that it was the sentencing judges task to weigh all the
    evidence concerning the potential for eventual control of the appellants risk
    of reoffending in the community.  Her finding on this issue, absent legal
    error, is entitled to deference from this court.  No legal error has been
    demonstrated here.  Nor has it been shown that her finding, on the evidence
    before her, was unreasonable: see <em>R. v. Currie</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260,
    146 D.L.R. (4th) 688, at paras. 35 and 40; <em>R. v. Ramgadoo</em>, 2012 ONCA

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassens evidence at the sentencing hearing had two components relevant to the
    appellants fresh evidence application.  First, it was his opinion that no
    effective psychological treatment options are available for offenders who, like
    the appellant, suffer from psychopathy.  Second, Dr. Klassen referred to some
    emerging evidence in the relevant scientific literature suggesting that the
    psychological treatment of psychopaths may exacerbate their conditions, leading
    to earlier and more frequent reoffending.  This observation was based on what
    Dr. Klassen described in his report as somewhat of a paradigm shift in the
    forensic psychiatric and psychological literature regarding treatment and risk
    management interventions for individuals with high PCL-R scores.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledges that, based on his understanding of the applicable
    science at the time of the sentencing hearing, Dr. Klassens evidence on these
    matters was not in error as at 2002.  However, the appellant argues that Dr.
    Morissettes evidence demonstrates that, in light of current scientific
    knowledge and experience, Dr. Klassen was wrong on both counts.  In
    particular, says the appellant, Dr. Morissettes evidence indicates that
    effective psychological treatment is available for psychopaths, and that there
    is no scientific support for the claim that a psychopaths risk of reoffending
    is enhanced by psychological treatment.  In fact, the contrary view concerning
    enhanced risk following psychological treatment, reported in the literature as
    at 2002 and relied upon by Dr. Klassen, has since been withdrawn or modified by
    the authors of the applicable studies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, the appellant submits, the scientific foundation for the sentencing
    judges conclusion regarding the possible containment of his risk has
    shifted.  Based on what the appellant describes as this sea change in the
    scientific understanding of the treatment of psychopathic sex offenders, he argues
    that the sentencing judges disposition was a miscarriage of justice warranting
    appellate intervention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject this submission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    there is nothing new in Dr. Morissettes opinion that effective treatment
    modalities exist for psychopaths.  Once again, his proposed evidence on this
    issue adds nothing to what was already before the sentencing judge.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Morissette recommends that the appellant receive medication by injection every
    month or every three weeks, coupled with psychological treatment and community
    supervision on release.  The sentencing judge specifically addressed the
    possibility of treating the appellant pharmacologically, by administering a
    sex-drive reduction drug.  She was also cognizant of the appellants trial
    period of pharmacological treatment prior to the hearing.  Having considered
    the evidence on these issues, the sentencing judge was not satisfied that this
    form of treatment would reduce the appellants risk of reoffending to an
    acceptable level.  This was the sentencing judges call to make.  I see nothing
    to support the conclusion that her finding on this issue was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    contrary to the appellants submission, the suggestion that psychopaths may be
    amenable to psychological treatment does not constitute a sea change in
    medical understanding of the treatment options for psychopathic sex offenders.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall
    that in his report, Dr. Bradford offered the opinion that there was a
    reasonable possibility of containing the appellants risk in the community
    through <em>a combination of pharmacological</em> <em>and psychological
    treatment</em>.  Dr. Fedoroff said much the same thing, although he appears to
    have placed greater emphasis on the risk-reduction features of anti-androgen
    medication (pharmacological treatment).  As I have said, the sentencing judge
    considered and rejected these opinions.  She was entitled to do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Dr. Morissettes opinion that, based on current medical knowledge, there is no
    support for the proposition that psychopaths may be at an enhanced risk of
    reoffending after psychological treatment adds nothing new to the information
    that was before the sentencing judge.  To the contrary, Dr. Morissettes
    opinion on this issue is virtually identical to that of Dr. Fedoroff.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Fedoroff specifically challenged Dr. Klassens opinion that psychological
    treatment is contra-indicated for psychopathic offenders.  He expressly
    disagreed with Dr. Klassens suggestion that there was growing empirical
    evidence that offenders with high PCL-R scores do not benefit from
    psychological treatment and may reoffend more frequently and more quickly after
    such treatment.  Dr. Fedoroff noted that some literature then in publication
    outlined treatment recommendations for institutionalized sex offenders and
    commented that one of the creators of the PCL-R test had told him that: there
    is no scientifically reliable evidence suggesting that psychopaths (individuals
    with high HPCL-R scores) cannot be treated.  He also indicated that he was
    unaware of any definitive long-term treatment study confirming Dr. Klassens
    suggestion that psychopaths may be at enhanced risk of reoffending after or
    because of psychological treatment.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the questions whether psychopaths can be effectively treated and whether their
    risk of reoffending can be exacerbated by psychological treatment were squarely
    in play before the sentencing judge.  Her reasons reveal that she was alive to
    these issues, that she considered the conflicting expert evidence concerning
    the appellants treatability, and that she made findings of fact that were
    grounded in the evidence that she accepted.  Dr. Morissettes opinions on these
    matters are therefore not fresh.  His is but a fourth voice from the
    psychiatric community that speaks to the precise questions addressed by the
    psychiatric evidence at the sentencing hearing.  This is not evidence that is properly
    admissible as fresh evidence on appeal: see <em>e.g.</em> <em>R. v. P.S.M. </em>(1992),
    77 C.C.C. (3d) 402, 59 O.A.C. 1 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the day, the sentencing judges conclusion that the appellants risk
    could not be adequately controlled in the community rested on a host of
    considerations, described above.  Dr. Klassens evidence of his understanding
    of the scientific literature concerning the potential deleterious effects of
    psychological treatment on psychopaths was only one of many factors that led
    her to conclude that there was no reasonable possibility of managing the
    appellants risk in the community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, in my view, Dr. Morissettes opinions on these issues do
    not meet the fourth <em>Palmer</em> criterion for admitting fresh evidence on
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final aspect of the appellants proposed fresh evidence concerns his
    suggested post-sentence progress while in custody.  In his report and
    testimony, Dr. Morissette offered the opinion that, based on the appellants
    therapeutic and pharmacological interventions since 2002, his response to those
    treatment interventions, and his willingness to change and accept treatment,
    there is now a reasonable possibility that his risk can be managed in the
    community.  In other words, based on the appellants progress and treatment
    gains in prison, there is reason to conclude that the public may be adequately
    protected from his risk of reoffending.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, this courts recent decision in <em>R. v. Sipos</em>, 2012 ONCA

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Sipos</em>, this court held that the appellate process ought not to be a
    forum to reassess a dangerous offender designation based on the offenders
    alleged post-sentence progress.  Rather, when it is asserted that an offender
    has made therapeutic gains while in custody, the Parole Board is best
    positioned to decide whether and when the offender should be released into the community. 
    As Doherty J.A. explained in <em>Sipos</em>, at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Appellate review is fundamentally an error correcting exercise.
    It looks backward to the decision under appeal. While appellate review is
    sometimes undertaken with the benefit of evidence not before the trial judge,
    the question always remains  did the court below fall into reversible error
    when it made the decision under appeal?  The possibility that a different
    decision might be made were the appellate court to consider the same issue <em>de
    novo</em> as of the time of the appeal (in this case some 14 years after the
    trial judge) is irrelevant to appellate review.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Doherty continued, at paras. 22 and 23:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The distinction between review for an error at the original
    proceeding and an assessment of the offenders status at the time of the appeal
    is no mere formalism.  The distinction is essential to the principle of
    finality, a core value in the justice system.  If this court decides to allow
    the appeal, there must be a new sentencing hearing.  Everyone involved in that
    hearing, including the victims caught up in the relevant matters underlying the
    dangerous offender proceedings, will be brought back to the dangerous offender
    hearing stage of the process.  The Crown must attempt to reconstitute its case
    years after the fact.  More importantly to the proper administration of
    justice, victims may be required to undergo the further trauma of new
    proceedings at a time when they could justifiably have believed that the
    horror, no doubt associated with reliving the relevant events in a courtroom,
    was long behind them.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I accept that the difficulties described above are inherent in
    appellate review whenever it leads to an order for a new hearing.  They are
    not, in my view, however, necessary to do justice to the appellant in a case
    like this one, where material relied on to support the claim for a new hearing
    offers no support for the assertion that there was a meaningful error made at
    the initial proceeding.  Where an offenders real claim is that he has
    progressed to the point that his status should be reassessed, an appeal from
    the original decision is not the appropriate mechanism by which to achieve that
    new assessment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Doherty J.A. observed in <em>Sipos</em>, the principle of finality is
    foundational to the criminal justice system.  It is fully engaged where, as
    here, no error at the original sentencing hearing having been established, an
    offender seeks a reassessment of his or her designation as a dangerous offender
    based on alleged post-sentence progress, including willingness to undergo
    treatment.  As <em>Sipos</em> holds, it is the statutory duty of the Parole
    Board to assess an offenders status on a regular basis and to determine
    whether any changes in his or her circumstances, if proven, warrant release: see
    also <em>R. v. J.M. </em>(2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 147 O.A.C. 388 (C.A.); <em>R.
    v. T.L.</em>, 2008 ONCA 766.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    make these additional observations.  First, in opposing the admission as fresh
    evidence of Dr. Morissettes opinion regarding the appellants suggested
    post-sentence treatment gains, the Crown argues that his opinion is
    speculative, based on incomplete information and, in effect, of insufficient
    reliability to alter the conclusion that the appellants high risk of reoffending
    is not manageable in the community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there may well be substance to these criticisms.  For example,
    although Dr. Morissette suggests that the appellant was given Provera  an
    anti-androgen drug  in June of 2007 and at the time of his report in July of
    2008, it is unclear whether and for how long this treatment continued
    thereafter, and how the therapeutic effects of the medication were monitored. 
    Moreover, Dr. Morissette suggested that: from what we know, [the appellant]
    responded well.  But the basis of this opinion appears to be the appellants
    own self-reports and repeated phallometric testing in 2001.  Both of these
    methods for assessing the appellants response to treatment were rejected by
    Drs. Klassen and Fedoroff and, ultimately, by the sentencing judge.  Suffice to
    say that it will be for the Parole Board to determine the extent and
    reliability of the appellants alleged post-sentence therapeutic gains.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    as I have mentioned, the Crown has filed fresh evidence, without objection by
    the appellant, in the form of the appellants 2006 to 2012 Parole Board of
    Canada reports.  I note that in its most recent report before this court, from
    2012, the Parole Board detailed the institutional programming undertaken by the
    appellant and his response to that programming.  The Board indicated that the
    appellants risk of general and sexual recidivism remains high, that further
    therapeutic work by the appellant is necessary  indeed imperative  and that
    the appellant himself has acknowledged both that he is still attracted to young
    girls, and that he continue[s] to have a long way to go in order to
    contemplate any form of release.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    does not appear that Dr. Morissettes report was before the Parole Board.  The
    reasons for this are unclear.  It will be for the Parole Board to determine,
    based on Dr. Morissettes evidence if it is filed with the Board, whether the
    appellants risk has been reduced to a level justifying his release into the
    community.</p>

avoid'><em>(f)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em><em> Conclusion Concerning Appellants Fresh Evidence</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons given, I conclude that the appellants fresh evidence application
    should be dismissed.  The proffered fresh evidence either fails to meet the
    fourth <em>Palmer </em>criterion for admission on appeal or, as I have
    described, it relates to matters properly to be dealt with by the Parole Board,
    rather than on appeal.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
