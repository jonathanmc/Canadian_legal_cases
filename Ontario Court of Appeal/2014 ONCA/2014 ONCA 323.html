    assault case, spent most of her childhood in the care of the Catholic Children’s
    Aid Society. During the period from 1976 to 1978, B.H. had been in 22 foster
    homes.  In early 1978, when B.H. was placed in the care of the respondent and
    his wife, as foster parents, she was in a desperately fragile state.  </span></p>

    and into mid-July of that year, when B.H. was barely 15 and the respondent was
    24, the respondent engaged in unprotected vaginal intercourse with B.H. on a
    number of occasions. B.H. became pregnant. The Catholic Children’s Aid Society
    (“CCAS”) was advised and removed B.H. from the respondent’s home.  The CCAS
    placed B.H. in what was then known as a home for unwed mothers where she gave
    birth to a baby girl. B.H. raised her daughter initially on her own and then
    with the assistance of a partner.</span></p>

    was not his wife over 14 and under 16 years of age, contrary to s. 146(2) of
    the 1978 Code; and (3) having illicit sexual intercourse with his foster
    daughter, contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the 1978 Code.  After the preliminary inquiry
    the Crown withdrew the rape charge.  The respondent pleaded guilty to, and was
    convicted of, having sexual intercourse with a female person between 14 and 16

    accepted the defence position and imposed a conditional sentence of two years
    less one day to be served in the community with terms that amounted to a strict
    house arrest. The sentencing judge also imposed a three-year period of

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The following agreed statement of
    facts was read into the record and formed the basis for the convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>1.  [B.H.] was in and out of the care
    of the [CCAS] beginning from the age of 6 years old. From approximately the
    beginning of 1976 until the spring of 1978, she resided in 22 different foster
    homes. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. As a result of [B.H.] being repeatedly moved between foster
    homes, and the nature of the care in some of those foster homes, [B.H.] was in
    an emotionally fragile state. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. [The respondent] and his wife were approved foster parents
    with the CCAS and in the early spring of 1978 they agreed to take in [B.H.],
    who at the time was 14 years old. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>4. [The respondent and his wife] owned a four bedroom home in
    Scarborough. Residing in the home were [the respondent and his wife] and their
    two children. Each of the children had their own room and [B.H.] was given her
    own room as well. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>5. Early on, after [B.H.] moved into the home, there was
    nothing untoward about the relationship between [B.H.] and any member of the
    [respondent’s] family. In fact, for the first time in CCAS care, [B.H.] finally
    felt that she was in a stable environment where she was treated on equal
    footing with the [respondent and his wife’s] biological children. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>6. The [respondent] was in a position of trust and authority
    over [B.H.] throughout her time in the home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The Offences</span></strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>7. Approximately 1-2 months after [B.H.] moved into the
    residence, [the respondent] was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident.
    As a result, he was housebound and both he and [B.H.] were in the home at the
    same time a lot. It was after this accident that the nature of the relationship
    between [B.H.] and [the respondent] changed. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>8. [The respondent] began making sexual advances towards [B.H.],
    and over a relatively short period of time, between the late spring of 1978 and
    mid-July 1978, there was vaginal intercourse on 3-4 separate occasions, all in
    the home. There was no other form of sexual touching before or after these
    incidents. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>9. At no time did [the respondent] use a condom. And, on each
    occasion he ejaculated inside [B.H.].</p>
  <p class=CQuote>10. As a result, [B.H.] became pregnant. The CCAS became aware
    that she was pregnant and removed [B.H.] from the [respondent’s] residence,
    placing her in a home for unwed mothers. The CCAS never reported these incidents
    to any police service. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>11. [B.H.] maintained custody of the baby and raised her,
    initially on her own, and subsequently with a partner. [B.H.’s] daughter
    believed that her biological father was [B.H.’s] partner, until [B.H.] told her
    the truth when she was a teenager. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>12. In April 2010, [B.H.] decided to contact the London,
    Ontario Police Department and reported the allegations. London Police provided
    this information to the Toronto Police Service who, in turn, conducted a
    further investigation. As part of that investigation, the TPS spoke with [the
    respondent], advised him of the allegations, and asked if he would consider
    providing a DNA sample. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>13. A consent sample was provided to the TPS and testing
    confirmed that [the respondent] was the father of [B.H.’s] daughter. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>14. [The respondent] was arrested and charged with the offences
    before the court and was released on an undertaking to the officer-in-charge.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>THE SENTENCING REASONS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>B.H. had attended
    court for the plea and for the sentencing hearing.  The sentencing judge began
    her analysis by describing her observations of B.H. as follows:  “To describe
    her appearance as that of a broken woman would be an understatement”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The sentencing
    judge then made observations about the respondent.  She commented on the
    extensive support provided by his friends and family and noted the difficulty
    they had reconciling the respondent’s positive personality traits with the
    “monstrous error in judgment” he had made in committing the offences.  The
    sentencing judge observed that the respondent had taken the witness stand and apologized

  <p class=CQuote>[35] [BH’s] victim impact statement was heart wrenching. The
    impact of these offences on her were described as follows and are obviously
    aggravating: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>a. Her life forever changed with the pregnancy. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>b. She was put into a home for unwed mothers and told to give
    up her child.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>c. She “was taken from being a kid with a life ahead of [her]
    to a kid raising a kid and living a life of fear”.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>d. Parenting was a struggle.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>e. She used to wash herself with bleach in an attempt to
    cleanse herself. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>f. She felt that “depression and fear became a way of life”.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>g. That although she married it did not last. She felt that
    during her marriage, her past was used against her to “attack” her in her
    marriage. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>h. That her life has been adversely impacted by what happened
    35 years ago.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>i. She suffers from chronic sleep problems, eating disorders
    and nightmares. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>j. She believes that the actions of [the respondent] have
    affected her entire life, including her marriage and consequently the lives of
    her children and grandchildren. She says: “Every relationship I have ever had
    in my lifetime has been adversely impacted by what happened to me some 35 years
    ago”. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>k. She describes herself as “numb”, especially when it comes to
    herself. She does not have a life and she cannot hold down a job. To quote [B.H.]:
    “I have not been the mother and grandmother I should have been because of the
    path of life which [the respondent’s] crimes have done. I am unable to trust
    few people in my life. … Trust is not a part of my world and never has been
    since I was violated by [the respondent] and then told I was a liar by the CAS
    workers when I went to them for help”.</p>

    “living nightmare”. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[36] I also consider the following to be aggravating factors
    regarding [the respondent’s] involvement in the offences before the Court: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>a. [B.H.] was under the age of 18 at the time of the offences.
    She was 15 and a virgin at the time she had sexual intercourse with [the
    respondent]. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>b. The acts of sexual intercourse occurred three to four times
    over a short period of time. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>c. [B.H.] became pregnant because [the respondent] did not take
    any precautions to prevent such an occurrence. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>d.  [B.H.] was an extremely vulnerable person having been in
    approximately 22 foster homes before being put into what she thought was a
    stable environment in the [respondent’s] home. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>e. [The respondent] was in a position of trust and authority
    which he breached when he engaged in sexual intercourse with [B.H.]. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>f. Although [B.H.’s] quality of life up until this point could
    not be described as ideal, it worsened with these crimes against her. She was
    removed from the home, entered parenthood at age 15 and remained in a situation
    that could be politely described as “chronic stress”. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>g. Although the blame for [B.H.’s] poor quality of life cannot
    be placed solely on [the respondent], his conduct was a significant
    contributing factor. As Crown Counsel submitted, it is impossible to quantify
    the damage inflicted on [B.H.] by [the respondent’s] conduct. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>h. Dr. Larry Schmidt described that [B.H.] suffers from severe
    post-traumatic stress disorder as well as medical conditions causing chronic
    pain such as irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. </p>

    the mitigating factors, the sentencing judge turned to the “dispute as to when
    [the respondent] knew of [B.H.’s] pregnancy”. The sentencing judge noted that
    in her victim impact statement, B.H. said that the CCAS had approached the
    respondent about her pregnancy in 1978 and that he had claimed he was not the
    father of her child.  The respondent, through his counsel’s submissions at the
    sentencing hearing, took the position that he did not learn about B.H.’s
    pregnancy until 2010 when the police contacted him. As noted above, the agreed
    statement of facts merely indicates that “the CCAS became aware that [B.H.] was
    pregnant and removed [B.H.] from the [respondent’s] residence, placing her in a
    home for unwed mothers.  The CCAS never reported these incidents to any police
    service.”</span></p>

    to the sentencing judge that he did not intend to rely on the respondent’s
    denial of responsibility for the pregnancy in 1978 as an aggravating factor for
    the purposes of sentencing as he did not want to force B.H. to have to testify
    again at a <i>Gardiner</i> hearing.  Although the timing of the respondent’s
    knowledge of the pregnancy was contested, defence counsel suggested that the
    respondent would have taken immediate responsibility for his actions had he
    known the child was his, and submitted that the sentencing judge could not
    “come to any other conclusion”, saying:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>My friend knows that my client takes the position that he was
    not aware of the consequences.  I know that this is one of the other situations
    where it may be controversial as to the fact that he was aware that he had a
    child out there, but he takes the position and in fact that was one of the
    reasons he consented to the DNA.  But that is not going to make a difference, I
    am sure, to Your Honour in terms of the ultimate sentencing, but you might
    given the information that you have here about the progression that this man
    has made, you might believe, as he would want you to believe, that if he had
    been able to do anything to help the daughter that he participated in bringing
    into this world he would have done it, and I don’t think you can come to any
    other conclusion when you see the evidence that’s before you, and I am sure

    the sentencing judge identified the mitigating factors she considered relevant
    as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[43] [The respondent’s] factual background demonstrates that he
    is a person of good character: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>a. [The respondent] is 61 years of age. He has led a productive
    life since these offences. He worked for the TTC commencing in 1972 and ending
    in 2008. During these 36 years, he was promoted 17 times. At the time of his
    departure, he was supervising over 5,000 people in his capacity as the General
    Superintendent of Surface Transportation for Toronto. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>b. He suffers from diabetes. A growth on his pituitary gland
    was removed surgically in 2011. Some pituitary tumor remains and as such, he
    will require lifelong monitoring. If the tumor grows, [the respondent] will
    require repeat surgery, possibly radiation and possibly hormone replacement. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>c. He suffers from Sleep Apnea Syndrome. Medical doctors are
    carefully and closely monitoring [the respondent]. He takes numerous
    medications. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>d. At the time of the offences, he was 24 years of age. He has
    no criminal record. Approximately 35 years have passed since the offences
    occurred and there is no evidence of any other criminal activity. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>e. [The respondent] appears to be proficient in construction.
    For years, [the respondent] has devoted his time and his handyman skills to
    family and community members in need. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>f. Upon his arrest, and 33 years after the offences, [the
    respondent] provided his DNA sample on consent so that he could help determine
    whether he was the father of [B.H.’s] child. This was the first time he had
    been asked to take responsibility for his most irresponsible conduct. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>g. [The respondent] is extremely remorseful. He asked to take
    the witness stand during the sentencing hearing so that he could face [B.H.] and
    apologize to her personally. As I have stated above, the apology appeared to be
    sincere and moving. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>h. Those who have shown support for [the respondent] through
    these difficult circumstances have also shown empathy for [B.H.]. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i. There is nothing to suggest that [the respondent] has been
    anything but a contributing member of our society. As Crown Counsel submitted,
    such letters from family, friends and colleagues that speak glowingly of [the
    respondent] are to be expected. I agree. However, what one normally does not
    see is the compassion shown for the victim of the crime such as that shown for [B.H.]. </p>

    judge started her analysis by concluding that the respondent should not be
    incarcerated. Having determined that critical matter, the sentencing judge then
    proceeded to explain how a conditional sentence would give effect to the sentencing
    principles relevant to this offence and offender. This approach runs contrary
    to the direction provided in <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paras.
    58-60, in which Lamer C.J. sets out the approach for determining the
    availability of a conditional sentence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[58]…<i>In my view, the requirement that the court must impose
    a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years can be fulfilled by a
    preliminary determination of the appropriate range of available sentences.</i>  
    Thus, the approach I suggest still requires the judge to proceed in two stages.
    However, the judge need not impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration
    at the first stage of the analysis. Rather, at this stage, the judge simply has
    to exclude two possibilities: (a) probationary measures; and (b) a penitentiary
    term. If either of these sentences is appropriate, then a conditional sentence
    should not be imposed.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[59] In making this preliminary determination, the judge need
    only consider the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in
    ss. 718 to 718.2 to the extent necessary to narrow the range of sentence for
    the offender. The submissions of the parties, although not binding, may prove
    helpful in this regard. For example, both parties may agree that the
    appropriate range of sentence is a term of imprisonment of less than two years.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[60] Once that preliminary determination is made, and assuming
    the other statutory prerequisites are met, the judge should then proceed to the
    second stage of the analysis: determining whether a conditional sentence would
    be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out
    in ss. 718 to 718.2. Unlike the first stage, the principles of sentencing are
    now considered comprehensively. Further, it is at the second stage that the
    duration and venue of the sentence should be determined, and, if a conditional
    sentence, the conditions to be imposed. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    by Juriansz J.A. for this court in <em>R. v. W.W.M </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(2006)</span></em>, 205 C.C.C. (3d) 410 (Ont. C.A).  In <i>Spence</i>, at pp. 454-456, the court held that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>When a period of many years has elapsed between the commission
    of an offence of sexual assault and its discovery by the authorities, that
    circumstance dictates review of the degree to which the usual principles of
    sentencing are applicable in such circumstances. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>… </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The lapse of time does not in any way render inapplicable the
    principles of general deterrence and denunciation. The first of these requires
    a sentence which will intimidate those other than the offender who might be
    tempted to follow his example. The second requires a sentence by the imposition
    of which the court will reflect society's view of the wrongness of the conduct,
    and persuade those who might be confused about what is right and wrong. These
    two principles may overlap in their effect on the choice of sentence.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The need for the sentence to reflect the community's desire to
    denounce offences of the kind with which we are concerned is not diminished by
    the passage of time. Conversely, if the court were to impose a lenient sentence
    because of the passage of time, some members of the community might regard the
    sentence as judicial condonation of the conduct in question. That would tend to
    lessen respect for the administration of justice. In the circumstances we are
    considering in these appeals, the lapse of considerable time, and (we assume,
    for the purpose of discussion) the intervening years of unblemished conduct, do
    not lessen the relevance of these two principles.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>...</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The only sentencing principles which may be affected by the
    lapse of time are those of individual deterrence and rehabilitation. By
    individual deterrence we mean that the sentence should deter the accused from
    committing a similar offence in the future. By rehabilitation we mean that the
    sentence imposed should reflect the hope that somehow, while serving his or her
    sentence, the accused will be rehabilitated and at its end will resume his or
    her place in society as a useful and law-abiding citizen. These two principles
    overlap. In the case of a sexual offence against a child, when on occasion the
    child does not report the offence to the police or any other authority until
    many years after the event, should the sentence be less than what it would have
    been if the prosecution had occurred not long after the commission of the
    offence? If the accused, during the intervening years, has led an exemplary
    life in all respects, including non-repetition of sexual offences, and upon the
    matter ultimately being reported to the authorities and during the resulting
    investigation and prosecution he is remorseful, then the principles of
    individual deterrence and rehabilitation may arguably, by themselves, not
    justify a stern sentence of the kind which would have been obligatory many
    years earlier. It will be noted, however, that if, despite having led an
    exemplary life, the offender lacks remorse, any potential discount must be less
    than it otherwise would have been. Indeed, in cases of this sort, of sexual
    abuse of children by parents, one might well ask whether one could ever have
    both remorse and lengthy suppression of the facts.</p>
