  <p class=Onappealfrom><strong>Epstein J.A.: </strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In April of 2010
    police discovered a marijuana grow operation and a large quantity of dry
    marijuana on the appellant’s cottage property.  The appellant was charged with possession
    of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, producing marijuana, trafficking
    in marijuana, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public
    peace, and unlawfully transporting a firearm in a careless manner.  After a
    three-day judge-alone trial, the appellant was convicted on all charges and sentenced
    to three years’ imprisonment.  The trial judge also made various ancillary
    orders including a 10-year weapons prohibition and forfeiture of 50% of the
    appellant’s cottage property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellant’s
    conviction appeal is based on his submission that the trial judge erred in
    drawing an adverse inference from the appellant’s exercise of his right to
    silence and in finding his credibility adversely impacted by the lack of detail
    in certain parts of his evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellant
    also seeks leave to appeal and if leave is granted, appeals that part of his
    sentence that ordered he forfeit 50% of his cottage property.  The appellant contends
    that the trial judge erred in his weighing of the factors set out in s. 19.1(3)
    of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, </i>(the “</span><em><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>CDSA</span></em><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>”) and imposed an order that is
    demonstrably unfit.  The appellant submits that the order should only apply to 33%
    of the property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>For the reasons
    that follow I would dismiss the conviction appeal.  I would grant leave to
    appeal sentence and dismiss the sentence appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>BACKGROUND FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The evidence at
    trial spoke to two completely different versions of events relating to the marijuana
    and related grow operation materials that the police found on the appellant’s
    cottage property.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In his trial
    testimony the appellant described how two men, whose names he learned were Fred
    Williams and a man referred to only as “Bruno”, kidnapped him and held him captive
    for five days prior to his arrest.  According to the appellant, these two men
    were responsible for the drugs discovered on his property.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Williams, testified
    and gave a different account of his involvement – one in which he had nothing
    to do with the drugs or the grow operation.  Williams’ evidence was that the
    appellant approached him and asked him to falsely take responsibility for the
    drugs in return for a substantial cash payment.  Williams agreed to do this and,
    in accordance with the agreement, confessed to the police.  Williams told the
    court that he later recanted.  As a result the police charged him with fabricating
    evidence and obstructing justice.  Williams pleaded guilty to the charges and was
    sentenced to 90 days in jail. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Appellant’s Trial Evidence Concerning the Kidnapping and
    Confinement </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellant described,
    in detail, a harrowing five days immediately prior to his arrest during which
    Bruno and Williams held him captive. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'> His ordeal
    started on October 9, 2010.  He was alone at his cottage property when two men,
    brandishing a gun and a knife, suddenly appeared. The men assaulted him and
    tied him to a wall inside his cottage. The men got hold of the appellant’s gun
    and ammunition and threatened harm to him and his family if he did not do as
    they directed.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>According to the
    appellant, Williams and Bruno told him he could not call the police, must do
    what he was told and must not try to escape or say anything to anyone.  They
    said they “knew the details” of his information.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The two men then
    forced the appellant to drive them in his truck to a farm in Sutton where they
    blindfolded him and put him in the back seat of the truck.  Later the men drove
    to a warehouse where they left the appellant in the truck for at least six
    hours. The two men returned the next morning and drove to a restaurant where
    they removed the appellant’s blindfold.  Williams went into the restaurant for
    about a half hour while Bruno remained in the truck with the appellant.
    Williams returned and the men drove back to the cottage at which point the two
    men sent the appellant to stay in a trailer the appellant had on the property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The next evening,
    the evening of October 10, the appellant drove the men to Barrie on their
    instruction.  The men met with some other people and then all three returned to
    the cottage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>On October 11, Williams,
    Bruno and the appellant drove to Orillia.  They returned to the cottage later
    in the day. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellant and
    his captors remained on the property on October 12.  The appellant, at the
    direction of the men, went into the bush and cut firewood.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Early the next
    morning, October 13, again in response to the order of the two men, the
    appellant loaded the wood into his truck.  The appellant was driving his truck
    loaded with wood along the driveway back to the cottage when he encountered the
    police and was arrested.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Arrest</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>On the morning of
    October 13, 2010, Officer Ronald Marshall and Officer Roch Perreault drove up
    the driveway of the appellant’s cottage property to execute a search warrant the
    police had obtained based on information that four men of Asian descent had
    been seen unloading marijuana from canoes on the river into a container on the
    appellant’s property.  The police met the appellant driving his truck and
    pulling a trailer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Officer Marshall
    got out of his car and spoke to the appellant who identified himself and admitted
    owning the property. Officer Marshall immediately placed the appellant under
    arrest for cultivating marijuana.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellant’s
    pick-up truck had a locked cap on the back.  The officers unlocked the cap and
    discovered two large dogs and a gun case that contained a Browning rifle with
    no trigger lock on it and a magazine loaded with live ammunition.  The trailer
    was filled with firewood with a net strung across the top.  Beneath the firewood
    the police discovered a false bottom under which they found eleven large
    plastic bags of dry marijuana.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The officers
    searched the property and discovered potting soil, fertilizer, a drying rack
    and more dried marijuana in various other locations.  The police seized thirty-one
    bags of marijuana totalling approximately 700 pounds.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>The Statement</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    appellant provided a video-recorded statement to Officer Ralph Betts.  The
    appellant admitted that the drugs were his and that no one else was involved.  He
    provided details about his marijuana grow operation, including start-up costs
    and anticipated revenue.  The appellant also described where he had obtained
    the fertilizer and the seedlings. He drew a map of the property indicating
    where he had planted the marijuana.<b> </b></span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    appellant recounted the circumstances of being kidnapped and held captive.  He
    said that when the police arrived and arrested him the two men disappeared. 
    The appellant testified that Williams and Bruno had arrived in canoes and that
    they must have placed the marijuana and related equipment around the property. 
    He testified that did not know that there was a loaded rifle in his truck.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    gave evidence that, upon arrest, he did not tell the police about the two men
    as he thought they were close by.  He then falsely confessed to the crimes as instructed
    by the two men.  He was under extreme stress and he feared for his family, life
    and property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    released on bail he contacted Williams whose telephone number he knew from
    having heard it while in captivity.  Williams eventually agreed to meet with
    him.  At the meeting, he told Williams to surrender to the police and confess or
    he (the appellant) would report Williams’ involvement with the drug operation
    to the police himself.</span></p>

    a friend, Harold Pinnance, introduced him to the appellant. The two men first
    met on February 8, 2011.  After several meetings, Williams agreed to accept
    money in exchange for pleading guilty to the drug offences but not the weapons
    offences. In March 2011, Williams went to the appellant’s cottage property with
    Pinnance and someone named Simon.  The visit was so Williams would be familiar
    with the property for the purpose of his confession.   Williams also met with a
    lawyer and prepared a written confession.</span></p>

    his analysis, the trial judge set out factors that he took into account in
    assessing the credibility of the two main witnesses - the appellant and
    Williams.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In para. 82, the
    trial judge identified a number of points that caused him to question the
    appellant’s version of events:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>1.  The [appellant] stated that he was threatened with
    his own rifle and the ammunition that he had stored in the cabinet in the house
    trailer. But he had already been approached earlier by two people one carrying
    a knife and one holding a gun. Yet he testified that he was not threatened
    until the rifle was retrieved and the ammunition was located in the house
    trailer cabinet.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>2.  The [appellant] drove his truck with the other two
    men to Sutton. He was taken to a large warehouse and blindfolded and he
    remained in the truck for 6 hours. The [appellant] offered no evidence as to
    whether anything was taken in the truck to the warehouse or whether any
    materials were taken from the warehouse and returned to the truck. The
    [appellant] was alone in the truck and blindfolded for 6 hours. He testified
    that he was tied in the truck but he gave no evidence as to what efforts, if
    any, he made to escape during the 6 hour period.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>3.  On the second evening, at approximately 8:00 to
    9:00 p.m. the [appellant] drove the two men to Barrie and down a road that
    travelled toward Angus. The [appellant] did not testify that he was blindfolded
    or tied on this trip. He testified that the two men went to another place to
    see other people and that they talked. He offered no information as to what
    efforts, if any, he utilized to escape or to seek help.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>4.  On the following morning, the [appellant]
    testified that he and the two men drove to Orillia, returning in the afternoon.
    But he did not offer or explain what happened in Orillia, where in Orillia the
    two men went to, and what they did when they arrived there.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>5.  The [appellant] testified that just as the police
    arrived on the morning of October 13th the two men disappeared. The [appellant]
    in no way indicated to the police that he had been a captive for four days nor
    did he seek to explain to them, when he was placed under arrest, that the
    responsibility for the marihuana operation rested with two men who had been on
    his property for 5 days and who had just left. The [appellant] did not explain
    or offer to the court where the men went to when the police arrived.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>6.  The cap of the truck had windows but the
    [appellant] testified that he did not see his rifle in the back of the truck, under
    the cap.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>7.  The [appellant] testified that he was under great
    stress and fear when he gave his police statement on the day that he was
    arrested. Yet in his police statement, he was able to provide considerable
    detail with respect to the grow operation including drawing a sketch of where
    the marihuana plants were growing, the number of plants that he grew, the
    amount of his start-up costs, the fact that he purchased potting soil and
    fertilizer at Canadian Tire and the fact that he could see the plants from a
    location in his cottage.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>8.  The [appellant] conceded that he was at liberty to
    telephone family and friends when he was a captive and that he was able to
    speak in Cantonese. Yet despite this freedom he asked no family member or
    friend to assist him in his predicament or to contact the police.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>9.  The [appellant] testified that an appointment was
    initially made with Mr. Williams on January 12, 2011 but that Mr. Williams did
    not show up. The appellant offered no details as to where the meeting was to take
    place, or the details with respect to the planned meeting.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>10. The [appellant] testified that he gave an
    ultimatum to Mr. Williams in Chatham. But he didn't explain why he travelled
    for more than 5 hours to deliver the ultimatum when he could have delivered the
    ultimatum to Mr. Williams when he spoke to him on the phone on February 6,
    2011. Nor did he explain why Mr. Williams, who he acknowledged he still feared
    to a certain extent, would so readily turn himself in to the police when he had
    not done so between October of 2010 and February 2011. If Bruno and Mr.
    Williams had physically assaulted, threatened and forcibly confined [the
    appellant], as he testified, over a period of 5 days, why would Mr. Williams so
    readily, and without further threats or actions agree at the meeting in Chatham
    to turn himself in to the police.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>11. The [appellant] testified that Mr. Williams
    delayed turning himself in because he couldn't find a lawyer and that he needed
    the name of [the appellant’s] lawyer. Yet the information before the court
    confirms that Mr. Williams met with another lawyer and made necessary
    arrangements to prepare the statutory declaration through that lawyer’s office.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>12. [The appellant] testified that some of the ply
    wood was freshly cut and that he noticed this on the trailer, yet in the
    picture placed before the court he was unable to point out any signs of newly
    cut plywood.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>13. Why would the [appellant] locate a shipping
    container on his property when solar panels could be mounted to a shed, his
    cottage roof or to a mounting pole?</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>14. [The appellant] detailed the movements of Bruno
    and Mr. Williams between October 9th and October 13th, but he did not explain
    how, or when, in this time frame, the two men harvested, transported and set
    out the plants for drying.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>15. [The appellant] did not explain why he only
    expected Mr. Williams and not Bruno to plead guilty and he did not mention
    Bruno to the police when he was arrested a second time in October of 2011.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    noted that, once the appellant was free of the control of Williams and Bruno,
    rather than going to the police, he met personally with Williams.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The trial judge then
    turned to problems with Williams’ evidence.  Under cross-examination, Williams
    admitted to certain errors in his earlier statements to the police. Williams confirmed
    that he had misstated the amount of money he was to be paid to take
    responsibility for the drug operation, and the amount of money the appellant
    provided him for expenses. Williams also expressed confusion about certain
    matters such as the location of the lawyer's office. The trial judge identified
    these problems as “minor inconsistencies”, many of which Williams clarified,
    and concluded that they did not seriously damage Williams' credibility.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The trial judge found
    that no evidence, other than the appellant's testimony, connected Williams to
    the appellant’s property or the marijuana grow operation.  Rather, the
    evidence, viewed in its totality, was consistent with the appellant’s owning
    and controlling his property and cultivating marijuana in the locations on the
    property that he had sketched out for the police in the course of his
    confession.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    to the appellant’s evidence about the kidnapping and captivity, and found that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[i]t strains credulity to suggest that [the appellant] would
    not have attempted to seek help, escape, call for help or immediately or
    thereafter spoken to the police to advise them of the role played by Bruno and
    Mr. Williams in the grow operation. Accordingly, I am unable to accept [the
    appellant’s] evidence and I discount most of it, except the statement which he
    gave to Officer Betts on October 13th, 2010.</p>

    the appellant’s evidence, the trial judge held that it did not raise a
    reasonable doubt.  He then concluded, on the basis of the prosecution evidence
    that, in relation to the drug charges, the Crown had proved the appellant’s
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

    Possession and Acquisition Licence and a Firearm Registration Certificate for
    the Browning rifle found under the truck cap.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellant was
    found in possession of a Browning rifle and a magazine containing live

    count 5, the trial judge further concluded that the appellant had the Browning
    rifle in his possession for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. The
    appellant had been convicted of the drug charges. The loaded Browning rifle was
    under the truck cap in the vicinity of hidden marijuana in the trailer’s
    compartment. The appellant was involved in illegal drug activity. There was no
    evidence that supported any innocent explanation for the possession of the
    loaded Browning rifle.  As the trial judge found at para. 95 of this reasons,
    it was therefore “reasonable to conclude that the appellant would require a
    loaded firearm readily available to defend himself in the context of this
    illegal and potentially highly dangerous activity.”</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>The [appellant] testified that just as the police arrived on

    against self-incrimination has been constitutionally enshrined as a principle
    of fundamental justice through s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The “unifying
    theme” of the principle against self-incrimination, as Abella J. described it
    in <i>R. v. Turcotte</i>, 2005 SCC 50, S.C.R. 519, at para. 43, quoting from
    McLachlin J. in <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 164, is “the
    idea that a person in the power of the state in the course of the criminal
    process has the right to choose whether to speak to the police or remain silent.”
    Individuals are under no obligation to assist the police. To allow evidence of
    an accused’s exercise of  his or her constitutional right to silence as
    evidence of guilt would render the right meaningless – a “snare and a
    delusion”, to use the evocative language of Cory J. in <i>R. v. Chambers</i>,

    respondent that of the seven impugned findings, only three, the first half of
    point 2, point 9, and part of point 10, demonstrate that the trial judge
    erroneously disbelieved the appellant due to his failure to provide details in
    certain parts of his evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    factors speak to something quite different - broad gaps in the appellant’s evidence.
    I summarize these evidentiary gaps to illustrate my point:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In the last half
    of point 2 and in point 3, the trial judge drew a negative credibility finding
    on the basis that the appellant did not testify as to having taken any efforts
    to escape or draw attention to his situation during the long periods of time
    when he was travelling with the two men.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In point 4 the
    trial judge addressed a similar type of gap in the appellant’s evidence – a
    period of time during which the appellant was driving around with the two men. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In
    these points the trial judge expresses concern with the gaps in the appellant’s
    evidence regarding any opportunities he had to consider escape or at least to
    draw attention to his plight.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In point 10, the
    trial judge pointed out that the appellant failed to explain why he felt it
    necessary to meet with Williams in person when he had, just two days earlier,
    dealt with him over the telephone.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In point 14, the
    trial judge considered the appellant’s failure to explain how the two men
    performed all the tasks necessary to set up the grow operation on his property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In point 15, the
    trial judge took into account the appellant’s failure to explain why he insisted
    that Williams turn himself in and not Bruno.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In
    these points the trial judge is expressing concern about other types of gaps,
    in which common sense requires an explanation be provided.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>There is a
    distinction between a version of events in which details have not been provided
    and a version of events in which there are gaps that, pursuant to common sense require
    an explanation.  Here, this distinction is particularly significant given the
    nature of the appellant’s version of events. An assessment of the veracity of
    such an unusual scenario necessarily requires thoughtful consideration of issues
    such as any opportunity the appellant may have had to escape or at least to attempt
    to escape and other details that would assist in lending credence to his version
    of events.  In my view, the gaps in the appellant’s evidence legitimately
    contributed to the trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s version of
    events simply did not accord with human experience and common sense.</span></p>

    concedes that the trial judge erred in taking two factors into account in
    concluding that the appellant was not to be believed.  These are: 1) failing to
    provide details about a meeting with Williams on January 12, where Williams did
    not show up (point 9) and, 2) failing to explain why Williams would suddenly
    decide to turn himself in after the appellant’s ultimatum (part of point 10).</span></p>

    reasons, I see nothing wrong in the trial judge’s reliance on any of the points
    in para. 23 listed above other than those set out in the first half of point 2,
    point 9 and part of point 10.  </span></p>

    to silence is an error of law that falls within s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii).
    However, it still falls to this Court to determine whether the convictions can
    be upheld despite the existence of such an error, with resort to s. 686(1)(b)(iii)

    Bemmel,</i> in which the appellant lived and worked on a farm that he had owned
    for decades, the appellant’s property cannot be said to have any of the
    characteristics that would support the conclusion that a portion should be
    protected from forfeiture.  The property in issue is not residential.  There is
    no evidence that the appellant or his family ever resided there.  It had been
    recently purchased.  There was no mortgage against it.  There is no evidence
    that it was put to any use other than for growing marijuana.  There was
    evidence of concealment.  </span></p>

    not interfere with the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to order
    forfeiture of 50% of the property.</span></p>

    I would dismiss the conviction appeal.  I would grant leave to appeal the
    forfeiture order and dismiss the appeal as to that portion of the sentence.</span></p>
