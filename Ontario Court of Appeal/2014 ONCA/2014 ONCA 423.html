  <h1>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 2011, the United States of America (the “United States”) requested
    the extradition of the appellant on various charges.  In July 2012, the
    extradition judge ordered the appellant committed for surrender on various
    charges.  In December 2012, the Minister of Justice (“Minister”) ordered the
    appellant surrendered to the United States on the charges for which he had been
    ordered committed for surrender.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the committal order and seeks judicial review
    of the Minister’s surrender order.  In keeping with the practice of this court,
    the two matters were heard together.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the appeal from the committal order, counsel submits that the
    extradition judge erred in refusing to admit evidence tendered by the defence
    to support the contention that the evidence relied upon by the United States in
    support of its request for extradition was unreliable and could not justify
    committal for surrender.  Counsel submits that the evidence proffered by the
    defence tended to show that the evidence of the two accomplices relied on by
    the United States was not credible.  Counsel submits that the extradition judge
    should have admitted the evidence, and gone on to determine whether the
    totality of the evidence on the hearing justified the appellant’s committal for
    surrender.  The appellant seeks a new extradition hearing at which his evidence
    can be received and the question of committal determined by reference to that
    evidence as well as the evidence relied on by the United States.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the judicial review application, counsel focuses on the disparity
    between the length of the jail sentence the appellant will face if convicted in
    the United States of the charges and the length of the jail sentence a person
    would face in Canada if convicted of the comparable offences.  Counsel argues
    that the disparity between the two is so great that the surrender of the
    appellant to face a draconian sentence in the United States would “shock the
    conscience” of the reasonably informed observer.  Counsel submits that the
    surrender of the appellant absent assurances by the United States authorities to
    the Canadian government that the appellant would receive a sentence comparable
    to the sentence that would be imposed in Canada contravenes s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> and is an unconstitutional exercise of the Minister’s discretion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the appeal and the
    application for judicial review.  </p>
  <p class=MHeading12><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>II<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    Sunday, August 3, 2008, a fire occurred at Sofa Outlet Inc. (“Sofa Outlet”), a
    furniture store in Roanoke, Virginia.  The fire caused more than $800,000
    damage to the Sofa Outlet and other stores located in the same plaza. 
    Investigation determined that the fire was intentionally set.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sofa
    Outlet was operated by the appellant.  Business was bad in August 2008.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whoever
    set the fire entered and left the Sofa Outlet premises without setting off the security
    alarm.  The alarm was activated by the fire personnel when they arrived in
    response to the call.  The appellant was one of four persons who had the codes
    needed to activate and deactivate the alarm.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sofa
    Outlet is nominally owned by the appellant’s stepmother, but she has never had
    anything to do with the business.  The appellant operated the business, made
    all business-related decisions and received any proceeds generated from the
    business.  The appellant filed a Proof of Claim with Sofa Outlet’s insurer,
    seeking compensation for the damages caused by the fire.  Any proceeds that may
    have been paid on the insurance claim would have been available to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael
    Lee had pled guilty to certain charges arising out of the arson and was serving
    a lengthy jail sentence.  According to the ROC, he was available and willing to
    testify against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lee, a convicted felon, met the appellant in February 2008 and did some work
    for him at the Sofa Outlet warehouse.  In late July 2008, the appellant
    approached Lee and told him that his store was not doing very well.  He offered
    to pay Lee to burn the store down so that the appellant could make an insurance
    claim.  Lee agreed to do so.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant gave Lee the key to the store and the code for the security system. 
    He told Lee to make it appear as though the store had been vandalized and then
    set on fire by the vandals.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee
    recruited Sidney Terry and Jason Varona to help him.  On Saturday, August 2<sup>nd</sup>,
    they went to the Sofa Outlet store and entered using the key the appellant had
    given Lee.  Lee deactivated the security system with the code given to him by
    the appellant.  The three men loaded some of the Sofa Outlet inventory into a
    truck and drove it to Richmond, Virginia intending to sell the inventory on the
    street.  Lee also took some business records from the office that the appellant
    had told him he wanted removed before the fire was set.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee
    and Terry, but not Varona, returned to the Sofa Outlet store on Sunday
    afternoon, August 3, 2008.  Once again, they entered using the key the
    appellant had given to Lee and Lee disarmed the security system using the code
    the appellant had given to him.  Lee and Terry then relaxed for a while, drinking
    a beer, having a cigarette and taking a nap.  After they awoke, the two men proceeded
    to spread accelerant around the store.  They started fires in several places
    within the building.  Lee reset the security system and the two men left the
    store locking the door behind them.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee
    received some money from the appellant.  He also received a credit card with a $12,000

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Terry,
    like Lee, was serving a sentence for offences relating to the arson.  He was
    also available and willing to testify.  His anticipated evidence was similar in
    most respects to Lee’s anticipated evidence.  According to Terry, he initially believed
    that he was only there to help Lee remove inventory from the store and take it
    to Richmond, Virginia for a “midnight auction”.  On Terry’s anticipated
    evidence, the appellant was party to the fraudulent removal of the inventory on
    Saturday evening.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Terry
    first learned of the plan to burn the building while removing furniture from
    the building on Saturday, August 2<sup>nd</sup>.  Apparently, Lee had planned
    to set the store on fire immediately after they removed the furniture.  Terry
    pointed out that as they would be taking the furniture to Richmond in a Sofa
    Outlet truck, it would be wise to wait until the next day to set the fire.  Lee
    agreed.  Terry recounted a conversation in which Lee explained to the appellant
    why the fire had not been set immediately after the property was removed from
    the store.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span

    door as they left the store.  </p>

    pistol telling him to “[d]o something with it”.  Lee was arrested in possession

    of sentencing proceedings, other court documents, criminal records, and
    statements made by the appellant to the U.S. investigators.  Most of the

  <p class=CQuote><em>Could the evidence sought to be admissible render the
    evidence proffered by the requesting state so defective or unreliable as to
    lead to the conclusion that it would be unsafe or dangerous to convict or

  <p class=CQuote>The fact that the requesting state relies on evidence of
    accomplices who made plea bargains goes to the weight of the evidence and does
    not render the evidence manifestly unreliable.  The weight of the evidence is a

  <h1>the appellant’s arguments</h1>
  <p class=Heading>A:  Did the extradition judge conflate the test governing the
    admissibility of evidence with the ultimate test governing committal for
    surrender?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    explained above, counsel for the appellant relied on s. 32(1)(c) of the Act in
    seeking the admission of the material on the extradition hearing.  That section
    provides for the admission of evidence adduced by the person sought for
    extradition if the evidence is “reliable” and “relevant to the tests set out in
    subsection 29(1)”.  There was no dispute about the reliability of the material
    tendered by the appellant.  The admissibility of the material depended on its
    relevance to the test for committal found in s. 29(1)(a) of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    29(1)(a) of the Act directs that the extradition judge should order committal for
    surrender if:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>… there is evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that,
    had it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in Canada on the
    offence set out in the authority to be proceed …</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Ferras</em> holds that committal is justified under s. 29(1)(a) only if there is evidence
    of the existence of each element of the offence on which surrender is sought that
    would allow a reasonable, properly instructed jury to convict were it trying
    the case in Canada: <em>Ferras</em>, at para. 46.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for committal in <em>Ferras</em> requires the extradition judge to “engage
    in a limited weighing of evidence to determine whether there is a plausible
    case”.  Chief Justice McLachlin explained, at para. 54:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The ultimate assessment of reliability is still left for the
    trial where guilt or innocence are at issue.  However, the extradition judge looks
    at the whole of the evidence presented at the extradition hearing and
    determines whether it discloses a case on which a jury could convict.  If the
    evidence is so defective or appears so unreliable that the judge concludes it
    would be dangerous or unsafe to convict, then the case should not go to a jury
    and is therefore not sufficient to meet the test for committal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in addressing the nature of the extradition judge’s power under s. 29(1) of the
    Act, the Chief Justice said, at para. 59:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Simply put, the extradition judge has the discretion to give no
    weight to unavailable or unreliable evidence when determining whether committal
    is justified under s. 29(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    providing for a limited weighing of the evidence, <em>Ferras</em> departed from
    earlier case law addressing the test for committal under s. 29(1)(a) of the Act. 
    The extent to which <em>Ferras</em> contemplated a weighing of the evidence was
    discussed at length by this court in <em>United States of America v. Thomlison</em>,
    2007 ONCA 42, 216 C.C.C. (3d) 97, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2007]
    S.C.C.A. No. 179; and <em>United States of America v. Anderson</em>, 2007 ONCA
    84, 218 C.C.C. (3d) 225, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No.
    159.  In <em>Anderson</em>, at para. 30, this court explained the limited
    weighing of the evidence enunciated in <em>Ferras</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Evidence may be rendered “so defective” or “so unreliable” as
    to warrant disregarding it due to problems inherent in the evidence itself,
    problems that undermine the credibility or reliability of the source of the
    evidence, or a combination of those two factors.  <em>I would stress, however, that
    it is only where the concerns with respect to the reliability of the evidence,
    whatever the source or sources, are sufficiently powerful to justify the
    complete rejection of the evidence, that these concerns become germane to the
    s. 29(1)(a) inquiry.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>  [Emphasis
    added.]</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Counsel
    for the appellant submits that if the party sought for extradition tenders
    reliable evidence that has the potential to impeach the reliability of evidence
    in the ROC, the extradition judge is obliged to admit the evidence and consider
    it in the course of engaging in the limited weighing of the evidence contemplated
    in <em>Ferras</em>: see <em>United States of America v. Wilson</em>, 2011 BCCA
    514, 281 C.C.C. (3d) 15, at para. 37.  Counsel submits that the proffered
    evidence obviously had the capacity to impeach the credibility of Lee and Terry
    and, therefore, the reliability of parts of the ROC.  He argues that this was
    enough to warrant the admission of the evidence and its consideration along
    with the ROC in determining the question of committal under s. 29(1)(a).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that there is a difference between the relevance of evidence to the test
    for committal under s. 29(1)(a) and, hence, its admissibility under s. 32(1)(c),
    and the ultimate question of whether the totality of the evidence justifies
    committal under s. 29(1)(a).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  <em>Wilson</em>, relied by the appellant, demonstrates the distinction.  In <em>Wilson</em>,
    the requesting state relied on summaries of conversations in which
    misrepresentations were made to the alleged victims of the fraud by employees
    of the person who was the subject of the extradition request.  At the
    extradition hearing, that person sought to introduce actual recordings of some
    of those conversations, alleging that the conversations would contradict the
    summaries in the ROC.  The extradition judge refused to admit the recordings
    into evidence.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal, at para. 37, held that the
    conversations should have been admitted and considered in determining the
    question of committal:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Where evidence is tendered that would tend to impeach the
    reliability of the ROC, the judge must consider that evidence and engage in a
    limited weighing of it to determine the sufficiency of the evidence for
    committal for trial.</em>  That function is at the heart of a fair and
    meaningful judicial process.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    recordings tendered in <em>Wilson</em> went directly to the existence of the
    misrepresentations, the <em>actus reus</em> of the alleged fraud.  Depending on
    the content of those recordings, they could have rendered the parts of the ROC purporting
    to summarize the misrepresentations so unreliable as to warrant their outright
    rejection.  The approach of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <em>Wilson</em> is consistent with that taken in <em>Anderson</em>, at paras. 44-45; see also <em>United
    States of America v. Pannell</em>, 2007 ONCA 786, 227 C.C.C. (3d) 336, at para.
    23.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is, however, quite different from <em>Wilson</em>.  Here, the question of
    the admissibility of the material tendered by the appellant under s. 32(1)(c)
    and the test for committal under s. 29(1)(a) merged for all practical purposes into
    a single question.  I will explain why.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ROC contained direct evidence in the form of the anticipated testimony of Lee
    and Terry, as well as circumstantial evidence implicating the appellant in the
    arson/fraud charges.  The gun charge depended entirely on the direct evidence
    of Lee implicating the appellant in his possession of the gun.  Taken at face
    value, the evidence summarized in the ROC fully justified the appellant’s surrender
    on the arson/fraud charges and the gun charge.  The appellant could avoid
    surrender only by producing evidence that demonstrated the unreliability of
    some part of the ROC that was essential to committal.  He proposed to do so by
    adducing material that challenged the credibility of Lee and Terry.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence tendered by the appellant had a single purpose.  The evidence was offered
    to show that, for the reasons identified in the material, Lee and Terry were
    not credible and that the parts of the ROC that relied on their anticipated evidence
    were, therefore, unreliable and could not justify a committal.  The success of
    the appellant’s argument depended entirely on whether the credibility-related factors
    identified in his material rendered the anticipated evidence of Lee and Terry so
    clearly unreliable as to warrant its outright rejection by the extradition
    judge.  This argument stood or fell on the material proffered by the
    appellant.  That material either did or did not establish the requisite level of
    unreliability.  This was not a case in which the extradition judge could not
    fully appreciate the potential impact of the evidence on the ROC when it was
    proffered by the appellant.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, because of the nature of the evidence offered by the appellant and the
    argument made as to the potential relevance of that evidence to the question of
    committal, the admissibility question under s. 32(1)(c) and the ultimate
    question of whether committal was justified were essentially the same question
    – did the proffered material demonstrate the manifest unreliability of the
    anticipated evidence of Lee and Terry as summarized in the ROC?  If the
    evidence did not have that effect, committal followed regardless of whether the
    evidence was said to be inadmissible, or admissible but inadequate to the task
    of demonstrating the manifest unreliability of evidence in the ROC.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    strictly speaking, I think the extradition judge was wrong in characterizing
    the issue as one of admissibility, that characterization did not prejudice the
    appellant in any way.  Had the extradition judge applied <em>Wilson</em> and admitted
    the evidence as tending to affect the reliability of the evidence in the ROC,
    he would still, on an application of <em>Thomlison</em> and <em>Anderson</em>, have
    determined that the proffered evidence did not warrant the rejection of any
    part of the ROC.  The result would have been exactly the result arrived at by
    the extradition judge – the committal for surrender of the appellant.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    approach taken by the extradition judge finds support in the analysis in <em>United
    States of America v. U.S.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2013 BCCA 483, 303 C.C.C. (3d) 541.  In that case, the subject of the
    extradition request sought to tender evidence on the extradition hearing demonstrating
    that for various reasons, the complainant, whose anticipated evidence was
    summarized and relied on in the ROC, was not a credible witness.  The Court of
    Appeal, at paras. 38-39, upheld the extradition judge’s refusal to admit that
    evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>The evidence the appellant sought to introduce at the
    extradition hearing did not contradict or wholly undermine the proposed
    testimony of S.S. [the complainant].  The proffered evidence simply raised
    circumstances that could cast doubt on the credibility of S.S.  The assessment
    of S.S.’s credibility is for the trial in Louisiana.  It is not the function of
    the extradition judge to assess her credibility and determine whether the
    appellant is guilty.</em>  Rather, the extradition judge is to determine

    In those cases, the court considered, at length, the extent to which the
    extradition judge could weigh the evidence in considering the question of
    committal.  In <em>Anderson</em>, at paras. 30-31, the court said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Evidence may be rendered “so defective” or “so unreliable” as
    to warrant disregarding it due to problems inherent in the evidence itself,
    problems that undermine the credibility or reliability of the source of the
    evidence, or a combination of those two factors.  <em>I would stress, however,
    that it is only where the concerns with respect to the reliability of the
    evidence, whatever the source or sources, are sufficiently powerful to justify
    the complete rejection of the evidence, that those concerns become germane to
    the s. 29(1)(a) inquiry.</em>  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In deciding whether defects in the case proffered by the
    requesting state are sufficiently serious to justify disregarding some part of
    the evidence relied on by the requesting state when conducting the s. 29(1)(a)
    assessment, an extradition judge must begin from the premise that the material
    properly certified by the requesting state pursuant to s. 33 is presumptively
    reliable for the purposes of the <em>Extradition Act</em>, including the s. 29(1)(a)
    assessment:  see <em>U.S.A. v. Ferras</em>, <em>supra</em>, at paras. 52-56. 
    The party resisting extradition <em>may rebut the presumption of reliability
    flowing from certification either by reference to the requesting party’s own material
    or by calling evidence to demonstrate fundamental inadequacies or frailties in
    the material relied on by the requesting state:</em>  see <em>U.S.A. v. Ferras</em>,

    some part or parts of the ROC essential to committal should be completely
    rejected as unreliable.  It is not enough to show that there is good cause to

    Those factors are the kinds of considerations that are inevitably left to triers
    of fact to assess based on <em>viva voce</em> evidence and a full hearing.  The

    evidence is supported by formidable evidence of the appellant’s strong
    financial motive and equally strong evidence that the fire was “an inside
    job”.  The circumstantial evidence points the finger of guilt at the

    tendered by the subject of an extradition request pursuant to s. <em><span

    concerned with describing the extent to which the extradition judge can weigh

    to which material in the ROC supporting committal can be rejected on the basis that

    C.C.C. (3d) 471, at paras. 31-32.  Nor, in my view, have there been any
    developments, either in the related jurisprudence or legislatively, that would
    cast any doubt on the correctness of the approach articulated in <em>Thomlison</em> and <em>Anderson</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    acknowledged in <em>Thomlison</em>, at paras. 39-45, the proper interpretation
    of <em>Ferras</em> is open to legitimate debate.  As noted above, at least two
    cases in the British Columbia Court of Appeal favour a somewhat broader power
    to weigh the evidence under s. 29(1)(a) of the Act, akin to the scope of
    appellate review of the reasonableness of a trial verdict under s. 686(1)(a)(i)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: <em>Graham</em>, at paras. 31-32; and <em>Bennett</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 19.  For the reasons in <em>Diab</em>,
    at paras. 139-40, I favour the approach in <em>Thomlison</em> and <em>Anderson</em>. 
    That approach is more consistent with the nature of the extradition process and
    the role of the committal hearing in that process.  Extradition hearings are
    preliminary proceedings.  They are not trials and cannot be allowed to take on
    the features of a Canadian domestic trial.  A level of review of fact-finding
    that is appropriate to an after-the-fact assessment of an entire trial record,
    as contemplated by s. 686(1)(a)(i), is not applicable to the function performed
    by the extradition judge when determining the question of committal under s. 29(1)(a). 
    While an appellate court could well determine whether a reasonable trier of
    fact could believe the evidence of Lee and Terry having regard to the entirety
    of a trial record, I do not see how an extradition judge could make that kind
    of ultimate assessment of their credibility based on the limited paper record
    available at a committal hearing.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>As the Chief Justice explained in <em>Ferras</em>, at paras.
    41-49, s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> demands
    that an extradition judge weigh to some extent the evidence tendered at the
    committal hearing.  That weighing process is intended to ensure that persons
    are not surrendered for extradition on the basis of evidence that is
    demonstrably unreliable.  Surrender in those circumstances would offend the
    principles of fundamental justice.  The s. 7 protection does not, however,
    extend to preclude committal where there is reason to doubt the ultimate
    reliability of the evidence or its ultimate probative value.  Those questions are
    left for the tribunal responsible for determining guilt and innocence: </span></em><em>Ferras</em><em><span

    made only one argument in his oral submissions challenging the Minister’s
    surrender order.  He submits that under the American sentencing regime, the
    appellant will receive a minimum sentence of 15 years on the fraud/arson
    charges plus a potential consecutive sentence of up to 10 years on the gun
    charge.  Counsel submits that the appellant, if convicted of the charges, will
    receive sentences totalling 20 years or more.  He compares that sentence to the
    three to five-year total sentence the appellant would likely receive if
    convicted of the comparable offences in Canada.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

    least 15 years longer than the appellant would face in Canada must shock the
    conscience of the reasonable member of this community.  Surrender to face those
    sentences, therefore, violates the appellant’s rights under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em><em><span

    United States that any sentence imposed on the appellant would be consistent

    made to the Minister and he considered it in his reasons ordering the appellant’s

    excess of any sentence that the appellant would face in Canada would violate s.
    7 of the </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.  In
    making that determination and exercising his discretion, the Minister considered
    the relevant jurisprudence.  Many cases have addressed this exact issue.  The
    case law supports the Minister’s conclusion that the potential sentence faced
    by the appellant in the United States, whether considered on its own or
    compared to the potential sentence in Canada, did not render his surrender
    contrary to the principles of fundamental justice. </span></em></p>
