  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice J.A. Payne
    of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated June 4, 2012 and the sentence imposed on
    August 27, 2012.</p>
  <p class=Endorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pled guilty to a single charge of sexual interference
    involving a 14-year old girl (A.B.).  The Crown also read into evidence on the
    plea allegations relating to an act of sexual interference with a second young
    girl, A.M.  She was 15 years of age.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed a sentence of two years less a day followed by
    probation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction.  He seeks to have his guilty plea
    struck on the basis that he did not receive competent legal advice and,
    therefore, his plea was not voluntary and not fully informed.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant filed an extensive affidavit on the appeal as did trial
    counsel.  It is fair to say that they have a different view of some of the
    relevant events.  Both were capably cross-examined.  The material filed on this
    appeal also included many communications between defence counsel and the
    appellant in the approximately one year and a one half leading up to the guilty
    plea.  We have relied on the contents of those documents to resolve some of the
    conflicts in the affidavits filed by the appellant and trial counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps most significantly, the material placed before the courts
    included the detailed written instructions provided by the appellant to trial
    counsel on the day he pled guilty.  Those instructions, on their face, belie
    any claim that the plea was not voluntary and fully informed.  The appellant’s
    cross-examination on his affidavit confirmed the contents of the instructions
    given to defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have also placed some considerable reliance on the thorough and
    careful plea inquiry conducted by the trial judge before accepting the
    appellant’s guilty plea.  The answers given by the appellant on that inquiry
    tend to confirm the validity of his plea.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We will address each of the four arguments advanced by counsel for the
    appellant in his oral submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, counsel argues that trial counsel did not make it clear to the
    appellant that the facts relating to the alleged interference with A.M. would
    be read into the record on sentencing so that the trial judge could take those
    facts into account as an aggravating factor on sentence.  The appellant apparently
    thought they were being read as “narrative.”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant knew that the allegations relating to A.M. would be read
    into the record on sentencing and he knew that he would be required as part of
    his plea to admit those facts.  He did so.  The appellant is an adult of apparently
    normal intelligence who was not operating under any kind of disability at the
    time he pled guilty.  We find it impossible to believe that he did not
    understand that at a minimum his admission of sexual interference with a second
    young girl would not help him on sentencing.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the appellant knew before he was sentenced that he would likely
    receive a sentence of two years less a day based on the facts he was prepared
    to admit.  The appellant received exactly that sentence.  It is impossible to
    say that any misconception he may have been under as to the impact of the facts
    relating to A.M. on his sentence had any effect on his decision to plead or his
    appreciation of the consequences of his plea.  Those consequences were exactly
    what he anticipated they would be.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    next argues that trial counsel should have determined the status of the
    co-accused, who was apparently going to plead guilty, and received full
    disclosure of the co-accused’s anticipated evidence before proceeding with the
    appellant’s guilty plea.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis upon which to conclude that the status of the co-accused was
    material to the appellant’s decision to plead guilty.  He made that decision
    before he was advised of the co-accused’s decision to plead.  Nor, in our view,
    was trial counsel wrong in telling the appellant that the co-accused’s decision
    to plead guilty and potentially testify for the Crown could not help the
    appellant’s case and could, if the matter proceeded to trial, change tactical
    considerations.  In our view, the decision by the appellant to proceed with his
    guilty plea was in no way tainted by any uncertainty there may have been as to
    what the co-accused might do, or what the co-accused might say if called as a
    Crown witness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel’s
    third argument is as follows.  He submits that the appellant was not aware of
    the case against him when he decided to plead guilty because trial counsel had
    not thoroughly reviewed the Crown disclosure with the appellant.  Counsel puts
    particular emphasis on the failure to review the complainants’ lengthy
    statements with the appellant before he chose to plead guilty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s cross-examination on his affidavit effectively undermines this
    submission.  The appellant clearly knew the substance of the allegations that
    the Crown would be putting forward on the guilty plea.  He was also aware of
    the damning confirmatory evidence in the forms of emails between himself and
    A.B.  A line-by-line analysis of the statements given by the complainants was not
    necessary for the appellant to have a full appreciation of the jeopardy he was
    in, the evidence the Crown had and the case the appellant would have to meet
    should he choose to go to trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    counsel submits that the appellant’s decision to plead guilty was not voluntary
    because the appellant pled guilty under considerable pressure.  Counsel
    observes that the trial date was coming quickly and the appellant knew that if
    he went to trial he faced the potential of convictions on all charges before a
    trial judge who might well impose a sentence of considerably more than the two
    years less a day that the appellant knew he was likely to receive if he entered
    a plea based on the facts as the Crown alleged.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that the appellant was under a great deal of pressure.  The
    circumstances giving rise to the pressure were not, however, the result of
    anything that trial counsel did or failed to do.  The pressure the appellant
    was under was a direct result of the circumstances in which the appellant had
    put himself.  By his own admission he had committed a serious offence.  He
    faced the very real risk of convictions in respect of both complainants and a
    potential jail term of four or five years.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision to plead guilty was made by the appellant.  He acknowledged in his
    cross-examination that he was in no way pressured by his counsel to plead
    guilty.  The pressure he did feel was, as indicated above, the product of the
    very serious predicament he had put himself in.  In our view, the plea was
    entirely voluntary in the legally relevant sense.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that the plea was voluntary and fully informed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    cannot leave this appeal without indicating that having read the material we
    see no merit to the allegations that the appellant did not receive effective
    assistance from counsel at trial.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no other reason to interfere with the conviction and the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has also appealed his sentence.  The trial judge’s reasons for
    sentence are thorough and, as we indicated in the course of the conviction
    appeal, we think the sentence imposed was very much within the appropriate
    range.  The sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
