  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Sean Doyle, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard and released orally: June 24, 2014</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on November 22,
    2011 by Justice Richard C. Gates of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a trial before a judge sitting without a jury, the appellant was
    found guilty on counts of invitation to sexual touching and sexual assault.
    Both counts related to a single incident. The sexual assault finding was stayed
    on the basis of <em>Kienapple v. R.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</span></em> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises several grounds of appeal alleging a variety of
    errors in the reasoning process the trial judge followed in reaching his
    conclusion that the Crown had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  In
    the view we take of this case, it is necessary to consider only one ground of
    appeal advanced by Ms. Pringle in her submissions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Pringle contends that the trial judge misapprehended parts of the
    appellants evidence about the day on which the complainant said the alleged conduct
    occurred. This error about the substance of the material parts of the evidence,
    Ms. Pringle says, played an essential part in the trial judges reasoning
    process that resulted in the findings of guilt. It follows, she submits, that
    the conviction is not based exclusively on the evidence adduced at trial and
    should be set aside.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all practical purposes this was a two witness case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that while she and the appellant were alone in
    their home, the appellant called her upstairs to the bedroom, put her hand on
    his penis and rubbed it in a circular motion for several minutes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified in his own defence. He denied the allegations
    entirely. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge made several references to
    admissions or acknowledgements in the appellants evidence, which, the
    judge said, reinforced the complainants testimony about the offence charged. For
    example, the trial judge found: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>On the day of the offence the accused acknowledged that he and [the
    complainant] were alone in the house watching television while [her brother]
    was outside and her mother and [her sister] were shopping. After he went upstairs
    to his bedroom he called her to tickle his back. This acknowledgement by him
    reinforced her credibility.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>On the day in question he testified that he and [the
    complainant] had been alone in the house watching television. After he had gone
    upstairs for a nap he called downstairs for [the complainant] to come and give
    him a massage. He lay on his side of the bed while she was on the other side
    where his wife slept. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>...he did in effect admit that he was lying on the bed under a
    blanket, naked, and that on many occasions he has received backrubs hes been
    similarly naked. There was no explanation given by him as to why, if he was
    anticipating a request to receive a backrub he could not have put on his pants
    or at least his underwear. He later stated that he had no recollection of the
    incident. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(he) admitted there were times when he was naked, including on
    the day in question, while lying on the bed, although covered with a blanket. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the respondent, Mr. Doyle concedes that the trial judge misapprehended
    parts of the appellants evidence in relation to the events on the date of the
    alleged offence. The result, Mr. Doyle acknowledges, was that the trial judge
    misunderstood that the appellant had not acknowledged: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that he was alone with the complainant on the date of the alleged
    offence; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that he asked the complainant to give him a massage; and </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that he was naked under a blanket at that time. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Doyle also concedes that these misapprehensions of the evidence
    factored into the trial judges credibility assessment. The trial judge
    considered that these admissions and acknowledgments reinforced the
    credibility of the complainant and the reliability of her evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge offered several reasons for rejecting the appellants evidence and
    finding that it did not raise a reasonable doubt about the appellants guilt. That
    said, it was then incumbent on the trial judge to determine, on the evidence he
    did accept, whether he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the
    appellants guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching his conclusion, the trial judge used what he erroneously characterised
    as the appellants admissions and acknowledgments as a make-weight to
    buttress the testimony of the complainant and to satisfy the burden and meet
    the standard of proof. He was wrong to have done so. And that error vitiates
    his findings of guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of our conclusion on this ground of appeal, we do not consider it
    necessary or advisable to consider the other grounds of appeal advanced by Ms.
    Pringle. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the conviction and stay set aside, and a
    new trial ordered. </p>
