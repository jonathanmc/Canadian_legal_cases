  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction by Healey J. for various sexual
    offences. The complainant, the appellants stepdaughter, was approximately six
    years of age at the time of the offences and was eight years of age at the
    trial. The appellant and the complainants mother A.C. each had two children at
    the time they became involved in a relationship. The appellant has two
    children, the oldest D.S. being approximately 8 years of age at the time of the
    offences. These two children ordinarily lived with their mother but would visit
    the appellant and A.C. every two weeks. The disclosure leading to the charges
    began when the complainant told others that her stepbrother D.S. was sexually
    assaulting her. The complainant then gave a number of statements, implicating
    the appellant, that were the focus of the prosecution and form the main basis
    for the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants main submission was that the trial judge erred in
    admitting the statements when, at trial, the complainant refused to testify
    about any acts by the appellant. While the trial judge admitted four statements,
    the core of the prosecution case was in a videotaped statement that the
    complainant gave to the police on May 20, 2009 and the complainants testimony
    at the preliminary inquiry in which she adopted that statement, which was
    admitted under s. 715.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The complainant was
    cross-examined at the preliminary inquiry. The trial judge also admitted a
    statement made by the complainant the day before the preliminary inquiry to the
    investigating officer. While the officer was concerned that the complainant
    would retract her complaints, as she had on an earlier day, the complainant
    ended up confirming much of the May 20 statement. The officer did not audio or
    video tape that statement and the substance of the statement was as later
    recorded by the officer in her notes. In her reasons, the trial judge dealt
    with the issues again raised before this court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that the trial judge properly applied the law as laid
    down, in particular in <em>R. v. Hawkins,</em> [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043 and <em>R.
    v. Khelawon</em>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787. The most compelling feature in this case
    was that the complainant testified at the preliminary inquiry and that her
    testimony was properly admitted by the trial judge in accordance with <em>Hawkins</em>.
    The videotaped statement of May 20 became part of the complainants testimony
    at the preliminary inquiry and was properly admitted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also see no error in the trial judges decision to admit the
    statement made to the police officer. The police officer explained why she did
    not audio or video tape the statement. The trial judge unequivocally accepted
    the officers explanation and her notes of the conversation. The officers
    evidence explained the failure to tape record the statement and provided a
    reliable version of the statement. Moreover, it was important that the
    statement be admitted to properly understand the basis for the testimony at the
    preliminary inquiry.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in relying upon a
    portion of the complainants statement as corroborative of the reliability of
    the statement. The portion referred to is where the complainant described, in
    her own words, ejaculation by the appellant. The appellant concedes that this
    statement shows that the complainant was subjected to a sexual attack. He
    argues, however, that this part of the statement did not confirm the
    reliability of the statement to the extent that it identified the appellant.
    The appellant submits that it was possible that the alleged assault by the eight-year
    old step-brother could have been the source of this information. This is a
    highly unlikely proposition. But, in any event, as we have said, the
    admissibility of this statement turned on the preliminary inquiry transcript
    and there was therefore no need for other corroborative evidence to render the
    statement admissible.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to adequately consider
    that because the complainant essentially refused to testify at the trial,
    defence counsel was unable to cross-examine the complainant in accordance with
    an earlier ruling permitting cross-examination related to the alleged sexual
    assault by the complainants 8 year old step-brother. The theory of the defence
    was that the step-brother and not the appellant had sexually assaulted the
    complainant.  The appellant did not attempt to cross-examine the complainant on
    this issue at the preliminary inquiry and did not lead other evidence at trial from
    the complainants mother and grandmother that could have supported this theory.
    The appellant submits that the trial judge should have exercised her discretion
    to exclude the hearsay evidence on the basis that the prejudicial effect
    outweighed the probative value.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The leading Canadian case on the evidentiary status of evidence from an
    unresponsive witness is <em>R. v. Hart</em> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (N.S.
    C.A.), which has been applied by this court in <em>R. v. Cameron</em> (2006),
    208 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.) and <em>R. v. Duong,</em> 2007 ONCA 68. In <em>R.
    v. Hart</em>, Cromwell J.A. identified several factors for the trial judge to
    take into account:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)     the reason for the unresponsiveness;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)     the impact of the unresponsiveness; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)     the possibilities of ameliorative action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those factors do not favour excluding the hearsay statements. The trial
    judge identified the reason for the complainants lack of response. The
    proceedings had lasted several years and the evidence shows that the
    complainant had been influenced by several people, especially her mother who
    was anxious to again live with the appellant. Her decision to no longer
    actively participate was a function of the proceedings. The impact of the
    unresponsiveness was limited. The complainant testified at the preliminary
    inquiry that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant and her step-brother. The
    nature of the assaults, as described by the complainant, were described in
    different ways. Finally, there were actions that could have been taken. Most
    importantly, the appellant could have led evidence from the mother and
    grandmother in an attempt to show that the step-brother had improper access to
    the complainant. That evidence was never led, even though the mother testified
    at the trial for the defence in respect of other matters. There is no basis for
    setting aside the convictions on this basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in relying upon
    Detective Lamannas opinion about the complainants demeanour. Much of the
    objected to evidence was properly admitted to explain the complainants
    demeanour to assist in understanding the reliability of the complainants
    evidence. We have not been persuaded that the trial judge gave improper weight
    to this evidence or in any way delegated her decision about reliability to the
    Detective. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in discounting the similarities
    between the allegations respecting the step-brother and the allegations made
    against the appellant. There is no merit to this submission. The trial judge
    was aware of the allegations and she gave complete reasons for explaining why
    she accepted the evidence that identified the appellant as the perpetrator.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge implicitly reversed the burden of
    proof by the way that she dealt with the appellants opportunity to commit the
    offences. The reasons do not support this submission. In her review of the
    evidence, the trial judge pointed out that the evidence from the complainants
    mother did not show that the appellant did not have an opportunity to commit
    the offence. This was an entirely fair summary of the evidence and did not
    reverse the burden of proof. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
