    tax reassessments issued to Inter-Leasing by the Minister of Revenue under <em><i><font

    Act</font></i></em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.40 (the “OCTA”). </p>

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Under the tax reassessments, Inter-Leasing is
    obliged to pay tax on certain interest payments it received during its 2001 to
    2004 taxation years as well as interest on the arrears. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4
face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[3]<font size=1
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Inter-Leasing appealed the tax reassessments. The
    appeal judge held that the interest income was “income from a business carried
    on in Canada” and that the Minister’s reassessment of corporate income tax was
    correct. Inter-Leasing now appeals to this court from that decision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4
face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[4]<font size=1
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>If, as the Minister contends and the appeal judge
    held, Inter-Leasing’s interest income is properly characterized as “income from
    a business carried on in Canada”, it will owe corporate income tax on the
    income. If, as Inter-Leasing contends, it is income from property, the income
    will not be subject to corporate income tax.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>If this court concludes the appeal judge erred in
    characterizing the income and the income is instead income from property,
    Ontario raises two subsidiary issues: 1) whether Inter-Leasing is liable to pay
    corporate income tax in any event pursuant to the OCTA’s General Anti-Avoidance
    Rule (“GAAR”); and 2) whether Inter-Leasing is liable for the corporate minimum
    tax (“CMT”) on the income from property. </p>

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>For the reasons set out below, I conclude that
    Inter-Leasing’s interest income was not income from business but rather income
    from property. I also conclude that Inter-Leasing is not liable for corporate
    income tax pursuant to the GAAR or liable for paying the CMT on its interest income. </p>

    incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, was a member of the Precision Group
    of companies, some of which are incorporated in Alberta for the purpose of
    providing services to the oil and gas industry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Before the transactions giving rise to this
    litigation, a number of Precision Group companies entered into a series of non-interest-bearing
    inter-corporate loans with one another. Following a corporate reorganization
    aimed at eliminating provincial tax, then payable to Alberta, the Precision
    Group’s non-interest-bearing inter-corporate debts were converted into interest-bearing
    deeds of specialty debt, which were payable to Inter-Leasing. At the relevant
    time, the deeds were physically located in the British Virgin Islands. </p>

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>As a result of the re-organization, the Alberta
    corporations in the Precision Group paid interest on the replacement loans to
    Inter-Leasing and deducted the interest as an expense from their income for tax
    purposes. Inter-leasing received the interest income and declared it as income
    for the purposes of federal income tax, as it became a resident of Canada and
    therefore subject to comprehensive federal tax. </p>

    British Virgin Islands, by acquiring units in a limited partnership in Ontario,
    it established a “permanent establishment” in Ontario for the purpose of the OCTA. </p>

    with a permanent establishment in Ontario, Inter-Leasing was obliged to pay tax
    imposed by the OCTA pursuant to s. 2(2). Prior to 2005, s. 2(2) corporations were
    not subject to corporate income tax on income from property, only on income
    from business. </p>

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>The appeal judge began his analysis with a
    discussion of the legal principles to be applied. He noted that “[i]n general,
    interest income that is received on investments is considered to constitute
    income from property rather than income from business”: para. 27. However, he
    noted that there are two exceptions to the general principle: “where
    investments constitute an integral part of the taxpayer’s business activities;
    or (ii) where the activities associated with the generation of interest income
    are in and of themselves a business”: para. 27.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4
face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<font size=1
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>In this case, he asked “[h]ow, if at all, were the
    debt instruments ‘employed and risked’ in whatever activity Inter-Leasing was
    engaged in?”: para. 28. He also asked “Are the refinancing activities
    associated with the generation of the interest a business on their own?”: para.
    29.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4
face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<font size=1
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>He further noted that where a taxpayer devotes
    extensive time and resources to managing investments, the taxpayer may be found
    to be involved in an investment business: para. 30. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4
face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[15]<font size=1
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Turning to the facts of this case, the appeal judge
    considered the level of activity undertaken by Inter-Leasing to generate the
    interest income. He suggested, at paras. 30-31 of his reasons, that the level
    of activity undertaken by Inter-Leasing was insufficient to qualify the
    interest income as income from business: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>In this
    case, the facts which support the conclusion that the interest income is not
    business income from a business are these:</span></font></p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(a)</span></font>     Inter-Leasing’s Amended
    Memorandum of Association explicitly prohibited it from carrying on business in
    Canada, except in the capacity of a limited partner;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(b)</span></font>     Inter-Leasing did not have any
    employees;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(c)</span></font>     earning the interest income did
    not require Inter-Leasing to undertake any regular administrative activity or
    oversight;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(d)</span></font>     Inter-Leasing did not have to
    manage any risk or make decisions in that regard[;]</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(e)</span></font>     Inter-Leasing had a single
    director throughout the taxation years;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(f)</span></font>      Inter-Leasing earned the
    interest income from merely four debt instruments that were acquired and held
    throughout the taxation years with no turnover;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(g)</span></font>     once the debts had been put in
    place as a result of the refinancing transactions, Inter-Leasing received one
    payment per year for the interest on each of the debts and simply turned around
    and advanced those funds to its parent Precision in the form of annual
    non-taxable dividends and non-interest bearing loans; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>(h)</span></font>     the debts required no monitoring
    activity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>Despite what the appeal judge described as the
    “passive nature of Inter-Leasing’s operations”, he ultimately concluded that
    the interest income “ought to be considered income from a business in Canada”:
    para. 34. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><font size=4
face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[17]<font size=1
face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>He found that Inter-Leasing’s main function and purpose
    was to assist the Precision Group in attempting to reduce its taxes. He
    reasoned that Inter-Leasing’s interest income arising from the specialty debt
    instruments was income from business as it was “employed in” or was an integral
    part of its business:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>[34]
    Inter-Leasing’s </span></font><em><i><font face=Arial>raison d’être</font></i></em> and principle function and purpose was to assist the Precision Group in
    attempting to legitimately reduce the after-tax cost of capital for companies
    within the Precision Group. It had no other object or activity to speak of.
    Even its investment in McMaster LP was a part of that enterprise.
    Inter-Leasing’s role was fundamental and critical to the accomplishment of an
    ongoing joint venture with the other companies in the Precision Group. That
    being the true nature of Inter-Leasing’s business, the transactions that it
    entered into, coupled with the subsequent administration and routing of the
    interest income earned, are core activities and ought to be considered income
    from a business in Canada. </p>

face="Times New Roman"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></font>In the circumstances, the court found that the presumption
    had not been rebutted. In reaching this conclusion, the court considered the
    large scale of investment activity involved in managing the investments,
    described as follows, at p. 526:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Throughout
    the 1973 to 1976 period, the funds remained invested in short-term
    interest-bearing securities but considerable energy and effort was expended by
    CMC in order to obtain a maximum return. About twenty per cent of the working
    hours of the senior company officer placed in charge of the investments was
    taken up in the day-to-day management of these investments. Every Friday, this
    officer carefully reviewed all transactions made during the week and decided on
    the investment strategy for the following week. At any one time there were as
    many as twelve employees involved in the management of the investments. The
    extent of the activity of this staff in managing the investments and their
    vigilance in earning a maximum return from the funds is evident from the
    numerous purchases completed each year (201 in 1973, 218 in 1974, 241 in 1975
    and 381 in 1976), the variation in the lengths of terms of deposits made and
    securities purchased according to the trend of market interest rates and the
    facts that seldom would the staff reinvest the funds realized from a sale in the
    same instrument. Finally, the funds available for investment and actually
    invested represented roughly one-half of CMC’s total assets during the 1973 to
    1976 period and the income earned from the investments constituted a
    significant percentage of the total income earned by CMC in each of the years
    in question – 21.4% in 1973, 52.7% in 1974, 35.4% in 1975 and 31.2% in 1976.</span></font></p>

    from business and income from property was developed in <em><i><font
face=Arial>Ensite Ltd. v. R</font></i></em>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 509, 33 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    491. Ensite carried on the business of manufacturing and selling automobile engines.
    It invested in a plant in the Philippines. Philippine law required that Ensite
    bring foreign capital into the country to finance the plant. Ensite developed
    an elaborate plan to protect itself from currency risks. Interest was collected
    on U.S. dollar deposits which were part of this plan. </p>

    was business income, as it had been employed and risked in Ensite’s business:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>The test
    is not whether the taxpayer was forced to use a particular property to do business;
    the test is whether the property was used to fulfil a requirement which had to
    be met in order to do business. Such property is then truly employed and risked
    in the business. Here the property was used to fulfil a mandatory condition
    precedent to trade; it is not collateral, but is employed and risked in the
    business of the taxpayer in the most intimate way. It is property used or held
    in business. [Emphasis added.]</span></font></p>

    legislative scheme expressly contemplates a corporation earning income from
    property and does not subject such a corporation to tax on that income. </p>

    interest income from business. Rather, the factors set out at para. 31 of the

    property income differently than corporate business income. To characterize Inter-Leasing’s
    efforts to structure its affairs to take advantage of this difference as
    engaging in a business is to undercut the well-established jurisprudence that

    factors in support of his conclusion that the interest income was income from
    business, many of the factors listed are irrelevant to that conclusion. For
    instance, paragraphs (b) to (g) relate to where activities took place, which is
    irrelevant to characterizing the nature of the income. Similarly, the fact that
    “Inter-Leasing is a corporation … presumptively carrying on a business in
    pursuit of its stated objects” is not helpful in determining whether the income
    is from business or property. As explained above, the <em><i><font face=Arial>Marconi</font></i></em> presumption is not helpful in the context of this case. </p>

    the specialty debt instruments was not income from business. The level of
    activity associated with receipt of interest income is highly suggestive of
    income from property rather than business. There was no other business in which
    income from the specialty debt instruments was employed or risked. And, as

    sharing of the major tax fields provides provincial governments with the

    The Privy Council explained the rule governing the <em><i><font face=Arial>situs</font></i></em> or location of specialty debts, at pp. 481-82:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>…the
    distinction drawn and well settled has been and is whether it is a debt by
    contract or a debt by specialty. In the former case, the debt being merely a
    chose in action – money to be recovered from the debtor and nothing more –
    could have no other local existence than the personal residence of the debtor,
    where the assets to satisfy it would presumably be, and it was held therefore
    to be </span></font><em><i><font face=Arial>bona notabilia</font></i></em> within the area of the local jurisdiction within which he resided; … and
    inasmuch as a debt under seal or specialty has a species of corporeal existence
    by which its locality might be reduced to a certainty, and was a debt of a
    higher nature than one by contract, it was settled in very early days that such
    a debt was <em><i><font face=Arial>bona notabilia</font></i></em> where it was
    “conspicuous”, i.e., within the jurisdiction within which the specialty was
    found at the time of death. [Citations omitted.] </p>

    apply in the context of modern corporate taxation, because it was developed in

  <p class=CQuote><font size=4 face=Arial><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>While
    our common law rules must be in step with the evolution of society as a whole,
    when examining a proposed change to a rule of property or contract law, we must
    also examine whether the rule is consistent or inconsistent with commercial
    reality.&nbsp;A rule may have a rationale which appears to be anachronistic
    while continuing to serve a useful commercial purpose.&nbsp;Our common law is
    replete with artificial rules which, although they may appear to have no
    underlying rationale, promote efficiency or security in commercial
    transactions.&nbsp;Such rules, in the circumstances where they apply, must be
    followed to create a legally recognized and enforceable right or
    obligation.&nbsp;Parties, therefore, structure their relations with these rules
    in mind and the rules themselves become part of commercial reality.&nbsp;Commercial
    relations may evolve in such a way that a particular rule may become unjust and
    cumbersome, and may no longer serve its original purpose.&nbsp;When the
    hardship which a rule causes becomes so acute and widespread that it outweighs
    any purpose that it may have once served, it is certainly open to a court to
    make an incremental change in the law.&nbsp;However, there must be evidence of
    a change in commercial reality which makes such a change in the common law
    necessary.</span></font></p>
