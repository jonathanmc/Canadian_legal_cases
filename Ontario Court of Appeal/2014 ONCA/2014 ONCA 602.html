  <p class=Heard>Heard: June 17, 2014</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentence imposed on February 4, 2013
    by Justice A.M. Molloy of the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom align=center style='text-align:center'>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=Judge>By the Court:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of five counts of sexual assault and four
    counts of sexual exploitation involving B.R., his girlfriends young daughter.
    The sexual exploitation convictions were stayed in accordance with <i>R. v.
    Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  The appellant was sentenced to five years
    imprisonment, less credit for 56 days pre-trial custody, yielding an effective
    sentence of four years, ten months and five days imprisonment.  Ancillary DNA and sex offender registration orders were also imposed.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, appeals against
    sentence on the sole ground that the sentencing judge erred in her
    determination of the appropriate range of sentences.  He submits that his
    five-year jail sentence is unfit, harsh and excessive, that the sentence
    imposed should therefore be set aside and that a sentence of three years
    imprisonment should be substituted in its stead.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appellants
    sentence appeal for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the sentencing judges view, this was a case involving an adult
    offender in a position of trust who sexually abused an innocent young child on
    a regular and persistent basis over a period of about two years.  Based on
    this description of this offender and these offences, the sentencing judge held
    that the general range of applicable sentences was between five and nine years
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not challenge the sentencing judges characterization
    of the nature of this case.  That characterization is fully supported by the
    evidentiary record.  On the sentencing judges undisputed factual findings, the
    appellant sexually abused B.R. on multiple occasions in 2006  2007, when B.R.
    was eleven and one-half to twelve-years old.  The assaultive incidents occurred
    when the appellant, upon whom B.R. and her mother were financially dependent,
    was in a position of trust and authority over B.R.  As the sentencing judge put
    it, the appellant was an adult in [B.R.s] life that she trusted and relied
    upon as she would a stepfather.  [The appellant] had access to her because her
    mother trusted him completely.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends, however, that the sentencing judge erred by
    applying the mid-to upper single digit penitentiary range of sentences
    identified by this court in <em>R. v. D.(D.)</em> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471. 
    He argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>D.(D.)</em> and similar
    cases because none of his assaults against B.R. involved actual penetration. 
    Relying principally on the decisions of this court in<em> R. v. D.M.</em> (2012),
    ONCA 894 and <em>R. v. A.G.</em> (2004), 191 O.A.C. 386, the appellant submits
    that where there is no penetration, the starting point for sentences for sexual
    offences against a child by an adult in a position of trust or authority is
    three years in jail.  As a result, the appellant says, his five-year term of
    imprisonment represents a marked departure from the sentences imposed for
    similar offences in the [appellants] circumstances, and the sentence imposed
    is harsh and excessive and cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject this ground of appeal.  It is immaterial in this case whether
    the appropriate starting point for the fashioning of a fit sentence for the
    appellant was three years in jail, as now urged by the appellant, or five years
    in jail, on the authority of <em>D.(D.)</em>.  Counsel for the appellant
    submitted at the sentencing hearing that the appropriate range of sentences on
    the facts here was between two to five years imprisonment.  Thus, the sentence
    imposed by the sentencing judge was at the upper end of the range acknowledged
    by the appellant as appropriate in all the circumstances, and at the low end of
    the range contemplated in <em>D.(D.)</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it cannot be said that the sentence imposed in this case
    was manifestly unfit.  The appellant supplied B.R. with drugs and alcohol and
    exploited her vulnerable state after her consumption of the drugs and alcohol
    he provided.  He did so on numerous occasions when B.R.s mother was unable to
    assist B.R. due to her own drug and alcohol consumption.  This pattern of
    grooming conduct by the appellant was an aggravating circumstance, as was
    B.R.s virtually helpless condition and extreme vulnerability at the time of
    the assaults.  An accuseds grooming of his or her child victim is one of the
    aggravating factors identified by this court in <em>D.M.</em> as justifying a
    penitentiary sentence of five years or more.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that, in some cases, this court has upheld or imposed
    sentences of less than five years imprisonment for conduct that might be
    regarded as more egregious than that of the appellant.  In this case, while it
    was open to the sentencing judge to impose a lower sentence, she was not
    obliged to do so.  Whether calculated from a starting point of three or five
    years imprisonment, the sentence imposed reflects no error in principle and is
    neither outside the applicable range nor manifestly unfit for these serious
    crimes.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the sentencing judges decision attracts significant
    deference from this court.  We see no basis for appellate interference with
    it.  Nor does the fresh evidence sought to be filed by the appellant alter this
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
