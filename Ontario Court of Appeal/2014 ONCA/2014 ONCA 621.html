    by Justice Silja S. Seppi of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury found the appellant guilty of three sexual offences committed
    against the same 12 or 13 year old complainant on a single occasion, between
    June 2002 and September 2003. After entering a stay of proceedings on one
    count, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to concurrent terms of
    imprisonment on the remaining counts. The result was a penitentiary sentence of
    three years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of the offence may be stated briefly. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was a friend of the appellants daughter. The appellant picked
    the complainant up at school and drove her to his home on the pretext that she
    would be meeting his daughter there. The appellant assured the complainant that
    his daughter would arrive home shortly from a medical appointment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant and the complainant were alone in the appellants
    home, the appellant made the complainant watch him urinate, exposed her to
    pornography, and touched his genitals in front of her. She was unresponsive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant retrieved a knife from the kitchen. He sat down beside the
    complainant on the couch, knife in hand. He kissed her twice. Again, she was
    unresponsive. He asked her to kiss him and lick him as he held the knife to her
    collarbone. She refused. He led her upstairs and asked her whether she wanted
    to test the mattress in the master bedroom. She declined. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and complainant returned downstairs. There he demanded
    that she remove her clothes and dance for him. He had the knife in his hand. She
    complied. During the dancing, the appellant made some sexually-charged comments
    about her body, then cupped her breasts and complimented them. The appellant
    put $100-$200 in cash on the table. He told the complainant to take it. She
    did.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was sentenced on these offences in September 2013, when he
    was 48 years old. He had been involved in a workplace accident 24 years earlier
    and suffered from a permanent physical disability as a result. He was not
    employed at the time of the offences. Then, as now, his sole source of income
    is disability pensions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2008, the appellant was convicted of several sexual offences. The
    complainants were his daughter and several of her friends. Each complainant was
    a teenager. The offences involved, among other things, repeated acts of sexual
    intercourse. Those convictions attracted a six year penitentiary sentence and
    the usual ancillary orders. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was granted day parole and transferred to a halfway house.
    He sought but was refused full parole when he was eligible. The Parole Board
    determined that he should continue on day parole because, by then, the charges
    of which he now stands convicted had been laid. On his mandatory release date,
    he moved in with his parents, who had then remained supportive of him throughout.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    his incarceration and thereafter on day parole, the appellant had cooperated
    with correctional authorities. He participated in sexual offender counselling. But
    when the jury found him guilty of the offences that are the subject of this
    appeal against sentence, his cooperation ceased. His statutory release was
    revoked. When sentenced on these charges, he had a <em>remanet</em> of about
    four months in connection with the 2008 sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant identifies two separate errors in the reasons of the sentencing judge
    which he says warrant a reduction of the sentence. He says the sentencing judge
    gave no effect to the principle of totality and accorded inadequate weight to
    the objective of rehabilitation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is on firm ground in his submission that the reasons of the
    sentencing judge make no mention of the totality principle. That said, the
    sentencing judge was well aware of the <em>remanet</em> of the earlier sentence
    and when it expired. Her failure to direct that the current sentence be served
    consecutively to the prior sentence means that the sentence under consideration
    here will be served concurrently with the prior unexpired sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    failure of the sentencing judge to expressly state that she had considered the
    principle of totality disentitles the sentencing judges decision to the deference
    that is normally its due. Despite the lack of deference, however, we would not
    interfere with the sentence imposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, a sentence of imprisonment of three years, perhaps more accurately,
    two years and eight months, was well within the appropriate range of sentence
    for these offences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offences involved a measure of planning on the appellants part and a betrayal
    of a young persons trust. When the appellant did not get his way, he
    introduced a knife as a tool of intimidation. He degraded the complainant by
    making her dance while naked, by the comments he made about sexy women and good
    women, and further, by offering her money. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    paramount sentencing principles in this case, as s. 718.01 instructs us, are
    denunciation and deterrence. Both statutorily and factually, rehabilitation
    occupied a lesser place in the sentencing analysis. While the appellant, during
    sentence and while on day parole, had participated in counselling programs, his
    renunciation of them on conviction for these offences does not augur well for
    his future rehabilitative prospects. Greater emphasis on rehabilitative
    prospects was not warranted. Nor does application of the totality principle
    warrant our interference with the sentence imposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that trial counsel for the appellant, who must have been alive to the
    prospect that the sentencing judge might well order the three year sentence
    sought by the trial Crown to be served consecutively to the prior sentence,
    advanced no argument on the point. We do not doubt that an effective sentence of
    eight years and eight months is a long sentence. But it is not beyond the range
    of appropriate sentences for the appellants conduct. A substantial penitentiary
    sentence was warranted. The sentence imposed, in our view, reflects no error in
    principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal from sentence is dismissed.  </p>
