  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice David A. Broad of

    2013 ONSC 139.</p>
  <p><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <h1>I. OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal involves the complex law of tenders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Ministry of Transportation (the “MTO”)
    concluded that the lowest bid for a contract to widen a highway – that of the
    appellant, Rankin Construction Ltd. – did not comply with the terms of the
    MTO’s invitation to tender. It accordingly awarded the contract to the
    second-lowest bidder. The appellant sued the respondent, Her Majesty the Queen
    in Right of Ontario (the “Province”), for lost profits suffered because of the
    MTO’s allegedly improper failure to accept the appellant’s tender. The trial
    judge dismissed that action and the appellant now appeals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>While my reasons are somewhat different than those of
    the trial judge, I agree with the result he reached, and would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1>II. THE BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Ref395520034"><span lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Briefly, the background is as follows. In August
    2005 the MTO invited tenders for the widening of Highway 406 in the Niagara
    region of Ontario. </span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%'>The
    275 pages of tender documents issued by the MTO included a document entitled
    “Instructions to Bidders”. Among other things, the Instructions to Bidders established
    procedures that bidders were required to comply with and set out provisions
    regarding the MTO’s acceptance and rejection of tenders. A number of the
    provisions of the Instructions to Bidders are considered on this appeal. For
    ease of reference, the relevant provisions are reproduced in Schedule “A”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The tender documents also required bidders to
    declare the value of any imported steel that they proposed to use in the
    project. Tenders were to be ranked based on the lowest “Adjusted Tender
    Amount”. In the calculation of that amount, bidders received a 10% discount for
    steel that was domestically supplied. The tender document specifically provided
    that H-Piles – one of the steel components required for the project – were not
    eligible for the 10% price preference for Canadian content.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based on inquiries it made of its supplier, the
    appellant mistakenly believed that the H-Piles specified in the tender
    documents were available domestically. The appellant therefore did not declare
    the approximately $500,000 value of the H-Piles as imported steel. As a result,
    the appellant obtained a 10% price preference for the H-Piles, contrary to the
    express terms of the tender documents, and the appellant’s Adjusted Tender
    Amount was approximately $50,000 less than it would have been had the appellant
    declared the value of the H-Piles. The appellant’s tender was the lowest
    overall tender and the lowest Adjusted Tender Amount at the time of opening of
    the tenders. Moreover, adjusted to exclude the benefit conferred by the mistaken
    classification of the value of the H-Piles as domestic steel, the appellant’s
    Adjusted Tender Amount would still have been $1.7 million lower than the next
    lowest Adjusted Tender Amount. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A competing bidder – Hard Rock Paving (“Hard
    Rock”) – complained that the appellant’s bid was non-compliant, because the appellant
    had not declared the value of the H-Piles as imported steel. Hard Rock and the
    Ontario Road Builders’ Association, of which Hard Rock was a member, asserted
    that the contract should be awarded to the next lowest bidder: Hard Rock.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The MTO conducted an investigation, which
    included interviewing the appellant. The appellant, in turn, made further
    inquiries of its supplier. The supplier advised that since no one in Canada
    manufactured the specified H-Piles, it “considered” the product imported from
    the U.S. to be domestic. However, the H-Piles fell within the definition of
    imported steel in the tender documents: “steel manufactured or fabricated
    outside of Canada.” The appellant acknowledges that the H-Piles constitute
    imported steel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After consulting with in-house legal counsel,
    the MTO contacted the appellant by telephone on October 25, 2005 and faxed the
    appellant a letter on October 27, 2005 – 21 days after the opening of tenders –
    advising that the MTO had determined that its bid was non-compliant. The letter
    did not specify why the MTO had determined that the appellant’s bid was
    non-compliant. On the advice of counsel, the MTO awarded the contract to Hard
    Rock. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant sued the respondent for damages in the form of loss of
    profits in the amount of $5,000,000. Following a six-day trial, the trial judge
    dismissed the appellant’s action.</span></p>
  <h1>III. THE LAW OF TENDER</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before outlining the trial judge’s findings, the
    appellant’s arguments on appeal, and my analysis of those arguments, some legal
    context is helpful.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court’s most recent judgment dealing with the law of tender is <em>Tercon
    Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways)</em>, 2010
    SCC 4, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 69. Though he and three others dissented in the result,
    Binnie J. provides a helpful overview of the law of tender, at para. 87<span
lang=EN-US>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>For almost three decades, the law governing a
    structured bidding process has been dominated by the concept of Contract
    A/Contract B initially formulated in </span><em>The Queen in right of Ontario
    v. Ron Engineering &amp; Construction (Eastern) Ltd.</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111. The analysis advanced by Estey J. in that case was that
    the bidding process, as defined by the terms of the tender call, may create
    contractual relations (“Contract A”) prior in time and quite independently of
    the contract that is the actual subject matter of the bid (“Contract B”).
    Breach of Contract A may, depending on its terms, give rise to </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>contractual</span></em><span lang=EN-US> remedies for
    non-performance even if Contract B is never entered into or, as in the present
    case, it is awarded to a competitor. The result of this legal construct is to
    provide unsuccessful bidders with a <u>contractual</u> remedy against an owner
    who departs from its own bidding rules. Contract A, however, arises (if at all)
    as a matter of interpretation. It is not imposed as a rule of law. [Emphasis in
    original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Tercon</em><span lang=EN-US> makes clear that the content of
    Contract A – sometimes referred to as the “bidding contract”<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> – is based on its express,
    and occasionally, implied terms: para. 17. In </span><em>M.J.B. Enterprises
    Ltd. v. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1999] 1 S.C.R.
    619, the Court implied a term, based on the presumed intention of the parties,
    that notwithstanding a “privilege” clause stating that the owner was not
    obliged to accept the lowest or any tender, only compliant bids were open for
    acceptance. And in </span><em>Martel Building Ltd. v. Canada</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2000 SCC 60, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 860, the Court implied a term requiring
    the owner to be fair and consistent in the assessment of tenders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At para. 93 of </span><em>Tercon</em><span
lang=EN-US>, <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Binnie J. cautions</span></em> that “[o]nly in rare circumstances will the Court relieve a party from the
    bargain that it has made.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> 
    He continues, at para. 94, that in determining whether a term should be
    implied, the focus is on the intentions of the actual parties, not those of
    reasonable parties, and that if there is evidence of a contrary intention, on
    the part of either party, a term may not be implied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Therefore, whether a Contract A has arisen, and
    what terms, if any, should be implied, are case-specific determinations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, the appellant argued that a Contract A
    between it and the MTO arose when it submitted its bid. The MTO breached that
    contract when it conducted an investigation in response to Hard Rock’s
    complaint and failed to award the Contract B – the contract to widen the
    highway – to the appellant. The appellant was accordingly entitled to damages
    for lost profits. The appellant argued that as in </span><em>Tercon</em><span
lang=EN-US>, the express exculpatory clause in the Contract A between it and
    the MTO did not insulate the Province from liability for the MTO’s breach of
    Contract A. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>IV. THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge concluded that the MTO was
    entitled to investigate the appellant’s bid for non-compliance; that the
    failure by the appellant to declare the value of the H-Piles as imported steel
    constituted material non-compliance with the tender documents; and that because
    of this material non-compliance, the appellant’s bid did not amount to
    acceptance of the MTO’s invitation to tender. Accordingly, no Contract A was
    formed, and the appellant could not sue for its breach. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    argument that, under para. 6.3 (discussed below) of the Instructions to Bidders
    that formed part of the tender documents, the MTO could only reject
    non-compliant bids within 10 days of the opening of tenders. The trial judge
    also concluded that even if the failure to declare the value of the H-Piles did
    not constitute material non-compliance, the appellant’s claim would be barred
    by the express exculpatory clause at para. 11.3 of the Instructions to Bidders.
    Finally, in the event that he was found wrong on the question of liability, the
    trial judge calculated the damages suffered by the appellant. He concluded that
    the appellant was largely able to mitigate its damages, and fixed its net
    damages at $938,228.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>V. THE ISSUES ON APPEAL</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes issue with each of the trial
    judge’s key findings. It argues that: (1) a Contract A between the Province and
    the appellant was formed when the appellant submitted its tender; (2) the trial
    judge erred in law in concluding that the MTO had the right to investigate the
    appellant’s bid for non-compliance; (3) the trial judge erred in determining
    that the nature of the appellant’s non-compliance – the failure to declare the
    value of the H-Piles – was such that the MTO was not required to accept the
    appellant’s bid; (4) in any event, under para. 6.3 of the Instructions to
    Bidders, the MTO could only reject bids for non-compliance within 10 days of
    the opening of tenders, and it had purported to do so 21 days after the opening
    of tenders; (5) properly interpreted, the exculpatory clause in para. 11.3 of the
    Instructions to Bidders does not bar the appellant’s claim; and (6) the trial
    judge erred in finding that the appellant had mitigated its losses by 75%. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I address the first five arguments below. Given
    my conclusions on those issues, it is unnecessary for me to consider the
    appellant’s argument regarding the calculation of damages.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>VI. ANALYSIS</span></h1>
  <h3 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Was a “Contract A” formed upon the appellant’s
    submission of its tender?</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellant that a Contract A
    arose when the appellant submitted its tender and purported to accept the call
    for tenders. The terms of that contract – express and implied – govern the
    rights and obligations of the parties arising from the appellant’s submission
    of its tender. It established how the bidding process would be conducted and the
    basis on which the MTO would consider bids for Contract B. The significance of
    the appellant’s non-compliance with the tender documents is that, pursuant to
    the express or implied terms of that Contract A, it may not be awarded Contract
    B, even if it is the lowest bidder – not that no Contract A is formed. I come
    to this conclusion based on the language of the Instructions to Bidders, which
    form part of the tender documents. In this case, the tender offer contemplated
    that tenders submitted might not be compliant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Paragraph 7.3 of the Instructions to Bidders
    specifically requires that a bidder include a tender deposit with its tender.
    This requirement is clearly material. However, para. 11.2 of the Instructions
    to Bidders also provides that “Tenders not accompanied by a Tender Deposit in
    the required amount may be rejected.” The fact that the MTO specifically
    addresses the consequences of the submission of a materially non-compliant
    tender – when viewed in conjunction with the other provisions in the
    Instructions to Bidders discussed below – is evidence that it intended that a
    Contract A come into effect, even if the tender submitted is non-compliant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At para. 11.1, the Instructions to Bidders also
    include a “discretion clause”, which I set out in full below, entitling the MTO
    to “waive formalities”. And, as I discuss below, I would imply a term that the
    MTO would not award Contract B to a non-compliant bidder, if the non-compliance
    were otherwise more than a “formality”. Further, at para. 11.3, the
    Instructions to Bidders include an express exculpatory clause, which, I
    conclude below, properly interpreted protects the MTO from claims arising from non-acceptance
    of non-compliant bids. Given all these provisions, in my view it is clear that
    the parties intended that contractual relations would arise on the submission
    of the appellant’s bid, even if the appellant’s bid were non-compliant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I note that while the trial judge concluded that
    no Contract A had come into existence, he nonetheless properly went on to
    consider the terms of the tender documents in his analysis of whether or not the

    that a Contract A governing the bid evaluation process had come into existence. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>is that no Contract A can come into existence where a bid is not
    materially compliant with the tender documents, without considering the effect
    of the tender documents. In other words, the terms of the offer to consider bids
    made by the request for tenders, as reflected in the tender documents, must be
    scrutinized to determine whether the parties intended contractual relations to
    arise on the submission of a tender: see </span><em>M.J.B. Enterprises</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 19. In my view, subject to the governing documentation, contractual
    relations would usually come into existence on the submission of a bid. This is
    a desirable result: it provides greater certainty as to the rights and
    obligations of the bidders and the owner, and may reduce the frequency of
    litigation arising out of the award of tenders. </span></p>

    unwritten policy that it would investigate if another bidder complained of
    non-compliance. While I do not accept that it is an implied term of the
    contract that the MTO would not investigate complaints of non-compliance, I do
    accept that in this case, as in <i>Martel</i>, there was an implied term, based
    on the presumed intention of the parties, that the MTO would be fair and
    consistent in the assessment of tenders submitted to it. However, I note that
    there was no evidence that the MTO investigated complaints in relation to the
    appellant but not in relation to any other bidders, or that the MTO was not
    otherwise fair and consistent in its assessment of the tenders submitted

    documents. One can only hope that, if it has not already done so, the MTO
    engages in a comprehensive review of its Instructions to Bidders to address
    this and other issues. In the absence of guidance from the tender documents,
    whether the appellant’s non-compliance amounts to a formality is not an easy
    question. In </span><em>Double N Earthmovers</em><i><span lang=EN-US>, </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>the Supreme Court divided, five to four, on the question of whether
    a bidder’s non-compliance was an “informality” within the meaning of the tender
    documents in that case, with the majority concluding that it was. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant essentially argues that its

    for its mistake. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent endorses the reasons of the trial
    judge, who, while not specifically considering whether the non-compliance
    amounted to a “formality”, found that the appellant’s non-compliance was “material”.
    The price preference for Canadian content was an integral element of the tender
    scheme. The tender documents specifically provided that the price preference
    was not available for the H-Piles. In the trial judge’s words, “materiality is
    to be determined objectively having regard to the impact of the defect on the
    tendering process and the principles and policy goals underlying the process.”
    It does not matter that the outcome of the tender process would not have been
    different. As the trial judge wrote, at para. 65, “[</span>t]he <span
lang=EN-US>focus is not on the impact of the defect on the </span><em><u><span
style='font-style:normal'>outcome</span></u></em><span lang=EN-US> of the
    particular tender process, but on the impact on the process itself, including
    the reasonable expectations of the parties involved in the process, including
    rival bidders” (emphasis in original). The respondent would argue that if the
    non-compliance is material, it is not a formality.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am guided by the generous view of
    “informality” taken by the majority of the Supreme Court in </span><em>Double N
    Earthmovers</em><span lang=EN-US>. I tend to the view that the appellant’s
    non-compliance was a formality because of the appellant’s honest intention to
    use Canadian steel<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> and the fact that the outcome, and the cost to the MTO, would have been the
    same had it declared that the H-Piles are imported steel. The price preference
    for Canadian steel was a mechanism for evaluating the competing bids. It did
    not affect the actual price to be paid by MTO to the successful bidder. And the
    MTO expected that American H-Piles would be used in the project. The
    appellant’s non-compliance “did not materially affect the price or performance
    of Contract B”, and therefore amounts to an informality:</span><em><span
lang=EN-US> </span></em><em>Double N Earthmovers</em><span lang=EN-US>, at
    para. 41.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> I would add the following. Maintaining the
    integrity of the public bidding process is thought to encourage more bidders to
    participate in the process.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> And increased competition, in turn, promotes the public’s interest in the
    government obtaining the best price possible. Here, the tender process was
    essentially fair and the appellant’s bid was materially less costly to the
    public purse. Given this, in my view, a balancing of the public interest in
    promoting the integrity of the public bidding process so that the government
    can </span><em>generally</em><span lang=EN-US> obtain the best prices, against
    the public interest in the MTO obtaining the best price possible in this </span><em>particular</em><span
lang=EN-US> case for widening Highway 406, also weighs in favour of the conclusion
    that the appellant’s non-compliance was a formality. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, whether or not the non-compliance
    amounted to a “formality” is ultimately not determinative. Contract A does not </span><em>require</em><span
lang=EN-US> the MTO to waive formalities. In my view, where an owner has the
    discretion to waive formalities and exercises that discretion reasonably and in
    good faith, it cannot be sued for failing to waive a “formality” and entering
    into a Contract B with a non-compliant bidder. Here, the MTO acted in good
    faith, and its conclusion that the appellant’s non-compliance was more than a
    formality – whether or not correct – was reasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It must be remembered that the MTO had entered
    into a Contract A with each bidder. As the Supreme Court observed at para. 69
    of </span><em>Tercon</em><span lang=EN-US>, a requirement that only compliant
    bids be considered has often been implied. In my view, a requirement that the
    MTO would not accept bids that were non-compliant, if the non-compliance
    amounted to more than a “formality”, can in this case be implied in Contract A
    on the basis of the presumed intention of the parties. Therefore, had the MTO
    been wrong in its conclusion, it risked being sued by the other bidders. They would
    have argued that the appellant’s non-compliance was more than a formality and
    did not relate to unbalanced pricing, and that the MTO was therefore not
    entitled to waive it. Indeed, in<i> </i></span><em>Bot Construction Ltd. v.
    Ontario (Ministry of Transportation)</em><i><span lang=EN-US>, </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>2009 ONCA 879, 85 C.L.R. (3d) 25, which similarly involved a request
    for tenders with a price preference for Canadian steel, a bidder who failed to
    declare imported steel, a complaint of non-compliance by a rival bidder, and an
    investigation, the MTO was sued by the rival bidder after proceeding to award
    the Contract B to the non-compliant bidder.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> Further, the MTO made its decision in this case several years before </span><em>Tercon</em><span

    the enforceability of exculpatory clauses in tender documents. In the

    Tender Opening that its bid had been “rejected”, as required by para. 6.3, its
    “rejection” of the appellant’s bid was invalid, and it was therefore required
    to award Contract B to the appellant, as the lowest bidder:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the intent of para. 6.3 of the
    Instructions to Bidders must be discerned from a review of the document as a
    whole. By paragraph 12.1 the MTO is given 30 days from tender opening to notify
    the successful bidder that its tender has been accepted. Given that the MTO is
    afforded 30 days to notify the successful bidder, the imposition of a 10 day
    period to reject for any reason creates an inconsistency. The juxtaposition of
    paragraph 6.3 in the same section and following the reference to “rejection” of
    unbalanced tenders, in this context must mean that if the MTO is to reject a
    tender on the basis that it is unbalanced, it must do so within 10 days of
    tender opening, giving reasons. The use of the word “discrepancies” in the
    title line to section 6.0 does not add to the matter as there is no mention in
    the body of the section to rejection due to “discrepancies”.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, it can be argued that what occurred

    As noted above, I would imply a term that the MTO not accept bids that are
    non-compliant if the non-compliance is more than a formality. Paragraph 11.1 of
    the Instructions to Bidders – which contains the discretion clause – does not
    impose a time period within which the MTO must decide whether or not it will
    waive “formalities”, and specifically provides that the MTO is not required to
    state reasons.  Given that, and given that para. 12.1 gives the MTO 30 days to
    determine the successful bidder, I agree with the trial judge that interpreting
    para. 6.3 to require the MTO to determine whether it will waive “formalities”
    and, if not, notify non-compliant bidders, within 10 days of tender opening,
    makes no sense. To require the MTO to notify all unsuccessful bidders of the
    reasons why it will not accept their bids within 10 days of Tender Opening,
    would effectively require the MTO to determine the successful bidder within 10
    days, rather than 30 days as expressly provided for under para. 12.1. In
    addition, contrary to the appellant’s submissions, restricting para. 6.3 to
    unbalanced tenders would not render the word “discrepancies” in the title to
    section 6.0 meaningless. It can be seen as describing para. 6.2. The effect of that
    paragraph is that a bidder cannot adjust its bids to correct discrepancies. I
    am of the view that para. 6.3 clearly does not apply to the decision of the MTO
    not to waive “formalities”. That being so, this is not a case for the
    application of the principle of </span><em>contra proferentem</em><span
lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, even on the appellant’s interpretation
    of para. 6.3, that clause does not provide that a “rejection” is invalid if the
    bidder is not notified of the reasons for the rejection within 10 days of
    Tender Opening. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, I conclude below that even if para. 6.3
    required the MTO to provide notice to the appellant within 10 days of Tender
    Opening that its bid was non-compliant because it did not include the H-Piles
    in its declaration of imported steel, para. 11.3 of the Instructions to Bidders
    – the exculpatory clause – would bar the appellant’s claim. I now turn to that
    clause.</span></p>

    went on to consider whether, if wrong in so concluding, the appellant’s claim

lang=EN-US>at paras. 62 and 122-23, sets out the three-step analytical approach
    to be followed when considering an exclusionary clause, which I would summarize
    as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US> The court must first interpret the clause to determine whether it
    applies to the circumstances established in evidence. This will depend on the
    court’s assessment of the intentions of the parties, as expressed in the
    contract.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>2.</span><span
lang=EN-US> If the clause applies, the court must then determine whether the
    clause was unconscionable at the time that it was made.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>3.</span><span
lang=EN-US> Finally, if the clause is applicable and valid, the court must
    consider whether it should nonetheless refuse to enforce it because of an
    overriding public policy (to be proven by the party seeking to avoid
    enforcement of the clause) that outweighs the very strong public interest in
    the enforcement of contracts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Applying this three-step approach, the trial
    judge concluded that even if the Crown had breached the terms of the tender by
    disallowing the appellant’s bid, the appellant’s claim was, as a matter of
    interpretation, barred by para. 11.3 of the Instructions to Bidders. He reasoned
    that had the MTO simply called off the project, the appellant would not have
    had a claim against the MTO. Its claim for damages arose out of the MTO’s </span><em>acceptance</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>of Hard Rock’s bid, and the </span><em>non-acceptance</em><span
lang=EN-US> of the appellant’s bid. It was therefore clearly covered by the
    wording of para. 11.3 – even if the MTO had erred in considering the
    appellant’s bid materially non-compliant. Further, para. 11.3 was not
    unconscionable at the time the contract was made: the appellant was a
    sophisticated contractor. And there was no overriding public policy that would
    justify the court’s refusal to enforce it: any error that the MTO might have
    made was made with the objective of promoting the integrity of the tendering
    process. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes no issue with the trial
    judge’s conclusion that para. 11.3 is not unconscionable, or unenforceable
    because of overriding public policy grounds. It argues that the trial judge
    erred in interpreting para. 11.3 as applying to the circumstances established
    by the evidence. According to the appellant, those circumstances are that: the
    MTO declared the appellant’s tender non-compliant based on an investigation
    that the MTO was not entitled to conduct; the MTO did so without giving notice
    to the appellant, with reasons, within 10 days of Tender Opening, as required
    by para. 6.3; and the non-compliance as a result of which the MTO did not
    accept the appellant’s bid was not material. The appellant says that the trial
    judge’s interpretation of para. 11. 3 “would allow the respondent to excuse
    itself from playing by the very rules that it imposed for the assessing of bids
    in the tender.” The appellant submits that the language in para. 11.3 is not
    specific enough to accomplish this.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would reject the appellant’s argument that para.
    11.3 does not apply in the circumstances. Having considered the text of para.
    11.3, in the context of the Instructions to Bidders as a whole, and in light of
    the commercial context of the tender documents, I agree with the trial judge
    that para. 11.3 bars the appellant’s claim. The language is in my view clear –
    both in the paragraph itself and in the context of the Instructions to Bidders
    as a whole. A bidder presumably would not sue unless it alleged that the MTO
    had breached a term – express or implied – of the tender documents by accepting
    another’s bid, or not accepting its bid. To interpret para. 11.3 as not
    applying where a breach by the MTO of the tender documents is alleged would effectively
    render it meaningless. Paragraph 11.3 is a commercial response to the increased
    litigation faced by owners arising out of the acceptance, and corresponding
    non-acceptance, of bids. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The relevant commercial context also includes
    that bidders are sophisticated parties and are free to choose not to submit a
    tender in the face of a broad exculpatory clause in the tender documents. And
    if, faced with such a clause, desirable bidders do not respond to requests for
    tenders, market forces will drive the owner to modify the terms of its tender
    documents to stimulate competitive tenders. For example, an owner might chose
    to limit an unsuccessful bidder’s damages to its costs of preparing its tender,
    instead of barring claims for profits lost as a result of the award of the
    tender to a competitor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted above, the appellant does not take
    issue with the trial judge’s conclusion that, in the circumstances, there was
    no overriding public policy that would warrant refusing to enforce para. 11.3.
    It is possible that there may be circumstances where the conduct of the owner
    in the bid process is so aberrant that it would justify a court’s refusal to
    enforce an exculpatory provision in the tender documents on public policy
    grounds. This is not such a case.</span></p>

    contractor “artificially inflates the value of divisions of work to be done
    first. The industry inelegantly describes this as front-end loading.” They
    explain: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The lack of balance may be
    evident in a bid, or in a required after-bid but pre-award submission. The
    result for the contractor is a cash flow which runs ahead of project
    completion. For the owner, this practice raises (at least) serious construction
    bonding problems (the bonding company may be partially or entirely discharged)
    unless it can be prevented. It also raises problems with lenders who are not
    anxious to have their loan advances running ahead of the value of construction.</span></p>

    for the H-Piles it had not, in fact, made any error, and its bid was compliant.
    However, as noted at para. 6 above, the tender documents specifically provided
    that H-Piles were not eligible for the 10% price preference for Canadian
    content. In light of this, the appellant’s honest intention can only be a
    factor in determining whether the non-compliance was more than a formality.</p>

    appears obvious to me that exposing oneself to [the risks of bidding] makes
    little sense if the [owner] is allowed, in effect, to circumscribe this process
    and accept a non-compliant bid.” Sandori and Pigott, at p. 343, cast doubt on
    this proposition. They describe <em>Ron Engineering</em> as having opened the
    floodgates of litigation. They write: “One of the basic premises on which the
    Canadian law of bidding now rests – that no bidder would bid knowing that the
    owner is free to accept non-compliant bids – is obviously false. For a century
    or two or more before <em>Ron Engineering</em> bidders did just that”.</p>

    to Cavanagh Construction, despite Cavanagh’s intention to use a different steel
    product than the one specified in the call for tenders. The next lowest bidder,
    Bot Construction, applied for judicial review of the decision on the basis that
    the MTO’s decision was unreasonable and breached the MTO’s duty of fairness to
    bidders. This court ultimately dismissed the application for judicial review,
    finding that the MTO acted reasonably and fairly. </p>
