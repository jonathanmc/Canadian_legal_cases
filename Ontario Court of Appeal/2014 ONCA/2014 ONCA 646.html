    June 2, 2005.  Her sister Z. was born on September 3, 2008.  C. is the
    biological mother of S. and Z.  M.B. is C.’s mother. M.B. also has a son, N. 
    Both C. and N. have a history of substance abuse, criminal convictions and
    incarceration. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    were born, the Society had already been involved with this family.  M.B.’s
    niece was placed in her care approximately 13 years ago as a result of the
    Society’s protection concerns.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    with M.B. in 2006.  In 2008, within days of Z.’s birth, an order was made under
    s. 57.1 of the <em>Child and Family Services Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (<em>CFSA</em>)<em> </em>granting M.B. custody of S.  Eight months later, in May 2009, Z. was
    placed with M.B. pursuant to an interim supervision order.  The custody order
    with respect to S. provided that M.B. was to facilitate reasonable access
    between S. and her mother C.  The supervision order with respect to Z. provided
    that access to C. be supervised.  However, on June 22, 2009, a few weeks before
    the apprehension, a Society protection worker told M.B. that all visits between
    S., Z. and their mother had to be supervised.  There was a concern about C.’s
    excessive use of alcohol.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    M.B. and her spouse separated. M.B. said that she was overwhelmed.  She left S.
    to stay with C. unsupervised because she needed time alone.  The Society
    learned that M.B. had allowed C. unsupervised access to the children and also
    allowed S. (then age four) to travel in a taxi alone. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>1.  The apprehension</p>

    apprehended the girls on July 24, 2009 on the basis that M.B. was unable to
    protect them from unsupervised contact with C., and that M.B., who was
    overwhelmed, could not care for them.</span></p>

    workers apprehended S., they found her alone in a residence with C.  The
    residence was in a state of disarray.  There were soiled dishes on the counters
    and dirty clothes throughout.  It was cluttered and chaotic.  The door to the
    bedroom where S. was found was off its hinges and had been placed over the
    entrance of the doorway to serve as a barrier. S. was on a bare mattress, alone
    in the dark.  She had her knees pulled up to her chest and was rocking back and
    forth, crying. C. was the only person there with S. </span></p>

    the apprehension, the Society planned to provide wardship for the children for
    three months while M.B. attempted to stabilize her life. The Society moved for
    a temporary care and custody hearing.  The hearing was uncontested.  The
    children were placed in the temporary care of the Society pending trial.  The
    order was not challenged until trial.</span></p>

    apprehension, the Society contacted the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan to determine
    if a placement was available in the First Nations community.  None was
    available.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    approached the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan and again no First Nations placement
    could be found. Another non-Aboriginal home was found and the children were
    placed with the D. family in March 2010.  By then, S. was four years old and Z.
    was one. The children have been with the D. family ever since.</span></p>

    proceeded to trial in the fall of 2011.  On the first day of trial, a
    representative of the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan attended and asked for a brief
    adjournment to review disclosure that had only been provided that day, and to
    consult with counsel.  The trial judge refused the adjournment, proceeded with
    the trial and ordered that the girls were to be Crown wards without access for
    the purposes of adoption.  The children were placed with Mr. and Mrs. D.  On
    appeal, a new trial was ordered on the basis that the trial judge should have
    granted the adjournment and that the trial judge failed to give “due weight and
    consideration” to the children’s First Nations status.</span></p>

    identity and the uniqueness of Aboriginal culture, heritage and traditions
    shall be taken into account.  There is nothing in the <em>CFSA</em> that
    suggests that the “weight” given to one consideration must be greater than the
    weight given to another.  All factors are considered with the over-arching goal
    of determining the best interests of the child.  This is consistent with the

    expert evidence regarding the struggles of Aboriginal youth placed with
    non-Aboriginal families and the confusion and identity crisis that can occur. 
    He referred to Chief Whiteduck’s testimony about the historical mistreatment of

    these factors along with the children’s Aboriginal heritage.  It was open to

    has been enormous stress on all the parties.  The effects of the ongoing
    litigation cannot be underestimated.  The parties have been before the courts
    for years – through two trials and three appeals.  It would be impossible for
    tensions not to filter down to the children.  S. told Dr. Moncion that she does
