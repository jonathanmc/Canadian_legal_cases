  <p class=Heard>Heard: September 17, 2014</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Dale Parayeski of the
    Superior Court of Justice, dated December 30, 2013, with reasons reported at
    2014 ONSC 1180.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>By the
    Court:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a motion for summary judgment brought by the third party, Golder
    Associates Ltd., against the defendant, The Hamilton Port Authority, the motion
    judge dismissed the Port Authority’s claim for contribution and indemnity
    against Golder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching his decision, the motion judge found that the plaintiff and
    plaintiff’s counsel had made formal and informal admissions at examinations for
    discovery and at the hearing of the summary judgment motion that conclusively
    established that the plaintiff had no claim against Golder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Port Authority does not dispute that its third-party claim for
    contribution and indemnity against Golder can only succeed if the plaintiff has
    a viable cause of action against Golder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Port Authority submits that the motion judge erred in
    relying on the plaintiff’s counsel’s alleged admissions at the summary judgment
    motion hearing when, among other things, any such admissions were not in
    evidence, were qualified and, in any event, were contrary to the plaintiff’s
    pleadings. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree. At para. 7 of his reasons, the motion judge described the
    statement of plaintiff’s counsel on which he relied:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In addition, at the motion before me, counsel for the plaintiff
    confirmed on the record that the plaintiff takes no issue with the location of
    the bore holes dug by [Golder].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statements of plaintiff’s counsel at the motion hearing on which the
    motion judge relied read as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Counsel for the Plaintiff]: … [W]hat I can do is say to you
    again I’ve just simply taken the page from the transcript … where [counsel for
    Golder] says:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>So … I take it … that [the plaintiff] accepts that there
    was, there were no representations in the Golder Report of June ’07, the
    preliminary geo-technical evaluation, which was either false, inaccurate or misleading?…</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>[Counsel for Golder]: You have no facts or evidence to
    suggest otherwise?</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>[Counsel for the plaintiff]: None….</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Counsel for the Plaintiff]: My client’s position <em>may be</em> at trial that there was nothing that they know of that was negligent in the way
    in which Golder prepared this report.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Court: I’m going to ask a much more direct question and if
    you can’t answer it I respect that.… <em>Does the phraseology in that [discovery]
    transcript that talks about nothing misleading, nothing inaccurate, does that
    or does that not encompass location of the bore holes?</em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Counsel for the Plaintiff]: <em>I think it does</em> encompass
    location because the larger context of what the parties understood was, <em>and
    the evidence will have to bear itself out</em> but the decision making process
    as to where the locations were for bore holes were initially those of Mr.
    McFarland who …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Court: From the fourth party.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Counsel for the Plaintiff]: From the fourth party but who was,
    we say, a representative of [the Port Authority], so it was [the Port
    Authority’s] decision where to put bore holes. We heard at examinations for
    discovery that it was open to Golder to make a suggestion as to where bore
    holes might be and in fact at an adjacent pier they apparently made some
    suggestions. Beyond that we also heard that there was a decision about costs
    associated with going out into the water and that would have presumably had
    some governing effect on do we spend the extra money to provide those bore
    holes. Beyond that my client who was not part of the process, appreciate, they
    come on after the fact, get the information. They know nothing more than what
    they heard at discovery so we know of no negligence by Golder in any decision making
    process.... [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming, without deciding, that an admission made by plaintiff’s
    counsel at the hearing of Golder’s summary judgment motion against the Port
    Authority would be binding on the plaintiff at trial, we are not satisfied that
    plaintiff’s counsel’s comments were capable of constituting an admission that
    the plaintiff did not have a claim against Golder. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central to the plaintiff’s claim is the decision taken as to where the
    test holes would be bored and the role, if any, that Golder played. The key
    statement by plaintiff’s counsel at the summary judgment motion related to the
    location of bore holes was that “I think” that a prior statement made by a
    representative of his client on discovery “encompass[ed the] location” of the
    bore holes. Plaintiff’s counsel added that “the evidence [would] have to bear
    itself out”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The qualifications that plaintiff’s counsel made do not support the
    motion judge’s statement that counsel had “confirmed … that the plaintiff takes
    no issue with the location of the bore holes”. In fact, the plaintiff maintains
    its plea in its statement of claim that, in effect, it relied on the
    representations made in the Golder report and that, either alone or taken together
    with the balance of the tender documents, the representations were inaccurate
    and negligently made. In our view, the motion judge’s finding is a palpable and
    overriding error. His subsequent conclusion, at para. 11 of his reasons, that
    the plaintiff has no claim against Golder based on the plaintiff’s admissions is
    tainted by this error and cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged at the motion hearing that the plaintiff did
    not, at that stage, have any evidence of a claim against Golder, plaintiff’s
    counsel’s remarks did not exclude the possibility that such a claim would be
    made out at trial on the whole of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argued that, even if we agreed with the appellant’s submission, we
    should nonetheless dismiss the appeal. This is because the third party claim
    was issued more than one year after Golder had substantially completed its
    work. The contract between the appellant and Golder has a one-year limitation
    clause that serves to bar the third party claim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the limitation defence was raised in the court below, the motion judge did not consider
    it as he dismissed the third party claim on other grounds. In our view, this
    court should not rule on the issue as part of this appeal. The appellant has
    raised questions as to whether the limitation period has run and whether it
    applies to claims for contribution and indemnity. The limitation issue is therefore
    best left to be resolved at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a
    result, we allow the appeal and set aside the motion judge’s dismissal of the
    third and fourth party claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties have agreed that the successful party should be awarded costs fixed in
    the amount of $10,000 plus disbursements and HST. We agree and award the
    appellant costs in that amount. </p>
