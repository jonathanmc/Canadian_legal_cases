    On application for judicial interim release pending appeal from the convictions

  <p class=Heading>Hourigan J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant was convicted of one count of sexual assault and one count
    of sexual interference. He brings this application seeking bail pending his
    appeal.</p>
  <h1> BACKGROUND FACTS</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant is 39 years of age and resides in Sudbury. He has four
    children, including one son who is severely disabled and under his care.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On or about August 24, 2010, the applicant was charged with sexual
    assault and sexual interference in relation to allegations made by a three-year
    old complainant, who is the daughter of a friend of his then girlfriend (the
    first charges).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On or about May 10, 2011, he was charged with sexual assault and sexual interference
    regarding a complainant who was between four and six years of age at the time
    of the alleged assaults and who was the daughter of a woman with whom he was
    residing (the second charges).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second charges came to trial first and the applicant was convicted.
    He was sentenced to 28 months imprisonment on May 20, 2014. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 29, 2014, by order of Justice Juriansz, he was released on bail
    pending appeal. That bail order was varied by Justice Benotto on July 25, 2014.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 10, 2014, the applicant was convicted of the first charges. He
    was sentenced on October 16, 2014 to four years imprisonment. He now seeks
    bail pending appeal in relation to those convictions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>(a)     The Test</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 679(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-46, the applicant has the onus of establishing that:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(i) his appeal is not
    frivolous;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(ii) he will surrender in
    accordance with the terms of the release order; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(iii) his detention is not
    necessary in the public interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown acknowledges that the appeal is not frivolous and concedes,
    therefore, that the applicant has met his onus on the first part of the test.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also concedes that there is no issue that the applicant will surrender in
    accordance with the terms of the release order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>(b)     The Public Interest</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue for determination on this application is whether the applicant has
    met his onus of establishing that detention is not necessary in the public
    interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Watt reviewed the governing principles regarding the public interest criterion
    in <em>R. v. Manasseri</em>, 2013 ONCA 647, 313 O.A.C. 55, at paras. 40-43:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The public interest criterion in section 679(3)(c) requires a
    judicial assessment of the need to review the conviction leading to
    imprisonment, on the one hand, and the need to respect the general rule of immediate
    enforceability of judgments, on the other: <em>R. v. Farinacci </em>(1993), 86
    C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 47-48.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Public confidence in the administration of justice requires
    that judgments be enforced. The public interest may thus require that a person
    convicted of a very serious offence, like second degree murder, who advances
    grounds of appeal that are arguable but weak, be denied release pending
    appeal:  <em>Farinacci</em>, at p. 48.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>But public confidence in the administration of justice also
    requires that judgments be reviewed, and that errors, if any, be corrected,
    especially where an appellants liberty is at stake:  <em>Farinacci</em><i>,</i> at p. 48.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The public interest ground assumes a place of greater
    prominence in cases in which an applicant has been convicted of a very serious
    offence and faces the prospect of a lengthy period of incarceration: <em>R. v.
    Baltovich </em>(2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (Ont. C.A.  Chrs), at para. 19; <em>R.
    v. Demyen</em> (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 324 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 326.  As a
    result, release of an applicant pending appeal of a murder conviction is rare:  <em>Baltovich</em>, at para. 20.  But where the grounds of appeal are strong
    and a serious concern about the accuracy of the verdict emerges from the
    materials filed, the public interest may favour release:  <em>Baltovich</em>,
    at para. 20; <em>R. v. Parsons</em> (1994), 30 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 169 (Nfld.
    C.A.), at pp. 186-187. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    these principles in mind, I turn to a consideration of the public interest
    criterion in the circumstances of the present case.</p>
  <h1>(<span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;text-transform:none'>c</span>)     <span
style='text-transform:none'>The </span>M<span style='text-transform:none'>erits</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral submissions, counsel for the applicant advanced two principal arguments
    regarding the merits of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> First,
    she submitted that the trial judge erred in rejecting the evidence of the
    applicant, without any assessment or evaluation of his testimony, simply on the
    basis that he found the complainant to be credible. It is the applicants
    position that the trial judge had to do more to explain why he rejected the
    applicants evidence and that he was not permitted to turn the trial into a
    credibility contest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making this argument, counsel distinguished <em>R. v. J.J.R.D.</em> (2006), 215
    C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.), which the trial judge relied on for the proposition
    that an outright rejection of an accuseds evidence based on a reasoned
    acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of the truth of conflicting evidence is a
    valid explanation for such rejection. Counsel submitted that in <em>R. v.
    J.J.R.D</em>, there was evidence corroborating the allegations in the form of
    diary entries, whereas in the present case, there is no corroborating evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    my view, this is a weak ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the trial judge referred to <em>R. v. Williams</em>, 2010 ONSC 184, and
    explicitly instructed himself that the trial should not devolve into a
    credibility contest. In addition, he found that the case required the
    application of the principles enunciated in <em>R. v. W. (D.)</em> [1991] 1
    S.C.R. 742. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am also not satisfied that <em>R. v. J.J.R.D</em> is distinguishable. It cannot
    be said that there is no corroborating evidence in the present case. For
    instance, the handwritten drawing by the complainant of the accuseds penis is
    corroborative. So too is the accuseds statement, made to the complainants
    mother while discussing the police investigation, that he wonders if he does
    things that he does not remember because he is not conscious. In addition, the
    trial judge found that the similar act evidence related to the first charges.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second principal argument made regarding the strength of the appeal is not
    found in the Notice of Appeal. Counsel submitted orally that the trial judges
    reference to the fact that the complainants version of events did not waver at
    any point  from her disclosure, to her police video statement, to her
    testimony at the preliminary inquiry, to her evidence at trial  was an
    impermissible use of prior consistent statements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the applicant has an arguable position on this issue, as it does not
    appear from the trial judges reasons that this reference was tied to the issue
    of identification and no allegation of recent fabrication had been made.
    However, I am not satisfied that this isolated reference in the trial judges
    very thorough reasons measurably strengthens what is otherwise a weak appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, as expressed above, the applicant has a weak appeal. I balance this view
    against the fact that the accused was convicted of serious crimes against vulnerable
    young children and that the applicant has received a fairly lengthy sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find that the combination of convictions for serious offences, a fairly lengthy
    sentence, and a weak appeal, demonstrate that the immediate enforcement of the
    judgement below should be of paramount concern. Therefore, the public interest
    balance required by <em>Farinacci</em> favours immediate enforcement of the
    sentence rather than judicial interim release. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>DISPOSITION</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the applicant has not met his onus under s. 679(3) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> and the application is dismissed accordingly.</p>
