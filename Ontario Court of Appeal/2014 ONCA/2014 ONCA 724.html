  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>

lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>West</span> Harbour<span lang=EN-US> (I)
    Residences Corp. (“the declarant”) is the declarant of the condominium
    registered as Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No. 2095 (“TSCC 2095”).
    TSCC 2095’s first board of directors, appointed by the declarant, adopted
    By-Law No. 2 requiring TSCC 2095 to enter into a warranty agreement with the
    declarant. That agreement limits the declarant’s warranties in respect of the
    common elements of TSCC 2095 to the statutory warranties provided in the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. O.31 (“</span><em><span lang=EN-US>ONHWP Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>”). The agreement also prevents TSCC 2095 from making any warranty
    claim in respect of the common elements except through the process established
    for and administered by the Tarion Warranty Corporation, which administers the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>ONHWP Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After a new TSCC 2095 board of directors was
    elected by the purchasers of individual units, TSCC 2095 brought an application
    seeking a declaration that By-Law No. 2 and the warranty agreement were invalid
    on the grounds that enacting the by-law and entering into the warranty
    agreement were beyond the authority of the declarant-appointed board of
    directors. TSCC 2095 also maintains that the by-law and agreement are
    unreasonable and therefore inconsistent with the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Condominium
    Act, 1998</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, S.O. 1998, c. 19. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 23, 2013, the application judge
    dismissed the application, and TSCC 2095 now appeals that dismissal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The dispute grows out of a residential
    condominium project at 628 Fleet Street in Toronto. The appellant, TSCC 2095,
    is a condominium corporation. The respondent, West</span> Harbour<span
lang=EN-US>, is the declarant of the condominium, having filed the declaration
    on July 23, 2010. The first board of directors of TSCC 2095 was appointed by the
    declarant. On July 30, 2010 that board of directors enacted By-Law No. 2, which
    states, in part, that the “directors of the Corporation [i.e. TSCC 2095] shall
    cause the Corporation to enter into an agreement with [the declarant]”
    stipulating, among other things, that </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>          The Corporation shall have no rights against the
    Declarant beyond those that are specifically granted to the Corporation under
    the Condominium Act, the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act and by Tarion
    Warranty Corporation, formerly the Ontario New Home Warranty Program;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          the Corporation’s only recourse against the Declarant
    for a final and binding resolution of any outstanding, incomplete or deficient
    construction items and any other related matters relating to the Property, the
    Corporation and the Building shall be through the process established for and
    administered by Tarion Warranty Corporation;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(e)     the Agreement shall neither be terminated nor
    terminable by the Corporation following the Turnover Meeting; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Also on July 30, 2010, TSCC 2095 and the
    declarant entered into the warranty agreement containing the provisions
    specified in By-Law No. 2. The warranty agreement states that the parties agree
    to those provisions “in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and
    agreements herein contained and other valuable consideration”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The warranties statutorily provided for by the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>ONHWP Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US> are limited in various ways.
    For instance, the amount of compensation is capped with respect to the common
    elements to a maximum of the lesser of $2,500,000 or an amount equal to $50,000
    multiplied by the number of condominium dwelling units in the condominium
    project. There are also specified and limited time periods for reporting
    certain deficiencies. TSCC 2095 has identified certain alleged construction
    deficiencies that it says may not be warrantable within the purview of the
    Tarion Warranty Corporation process. However, the point is in dispute and all
    of the deficiencies identified to date are being addressed in that process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The warranty agreement and By-Law No. 2 were
    disclosed in the declarant’s disclosure statement, and in the agreements of
    purchase and sale that the declarant entered into with original purchasers. In
    his reasons, the application judge notes that the “by-law and [warranty]
    agreement were registered on title to the condominium project, to give notice
    to all prospective purchasers of condominium units that the liability of the
    developer to the condominium corporation was limited.” According to the
    declarant, all purchasers were represented by counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In accordance with the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Condominium Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, s. 43, the initial
    condominium board appointed by the declarant must call and hold a turnover
    meeting within 42 days after the declarant ceases to be the registered owner of
    a majority of the condominium units. At the turnover meeting the individual
    unit owners elect a new board. The turnover meeting for TSCC 2095 was held on October
    28, 2010.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 15, 2012, TSCC 2095 filed its Notice of
    Application, through which it sought a declaration that By-Law No. 2 and the
    warranty agreement were void and of no force or effect.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge dismissed </span><span
lang=EN-US>TSCC 2095’s application finding that “[n]othing in the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Condominium Act,</span></em><span lang=EN-US> the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>ONHWP Act</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> or any other provincial legislation, precludes a developer from
    limiting its liability in respect to common elements.” There was, therefore, no
    basis for concluding that By-Law No. 2 or the warranty agreement were </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>ultra vires</span></em><span lang=EN-US> the declarant board or
    unreasonable within the meaning of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Condominium
    Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, TSCC 2095 argues that By-Law No. 2 is
    void and of no force or effect because:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it is not within the enumerated subject matters of permissible by-laws
    provided for in s. 56 of the <em>Condominium Act</em>, and is inconsistent with
    the <em>Condominium Act</em> and TSCC 2095’s declaration; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it is otherwise unreasonable, contrary to the <em>Condominium Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>TSCC 2095 then argues that, absent a properly
    enacted by-law, the directors had no authority to enter into the warranty
    agreement with the declarant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issues on appeal are, therefore, as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the impugned by-law <em>ultra vires</em>?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the impugned by-law unreasonable?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can the warranty agreement be valid even if the by-law is found to be invalid?</p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Is the impugned by-law <em>ultra vires</em>?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge found that s. 56 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Condominium Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US> provided the initial
    board of TSCC 2095 broad authority to adopt by-laws governing the management
    and operation of the condominium. Encompassed within this broad discretion was
    the power to enact By-Law No. 2. In his reasons, the application judge noted that</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>it would be within the Board’s jurisdiction to
    assert, prosecute and settle a claim against [the declarant]. It follows, then,
    that it is within the Board’s jurisdiction to decide not to do any of these
    things and to embody that decision in an agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>TSCC 2095 argues that the application judge erred in three respects.
    First he erred in concluding that the by-law fell within the powers granted in
    s. 56 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Condominium Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>. Further, he erred in failing to find that, even if authority for
    the passage of By-Law No. 2 could be found in the various subsections of s. 56(1),
    it was nonetheless unauthorized because it breached the requirement in s. 56(1)
    that a by-law adopted by the board not be otherwise “contrary to this Act or to
    the declaration”. Finally, he erred in failing to find that by passing By-Law
    No. 2 the declarant-appointed directors breached their statutory obligations
    set out in s. 37 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Condominium Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>. I will deal with these three submissions in turn.</span></p>
  <h6><span lang=EN>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Does the by-law fall within one of the powers
    listed in s. 56(1)?</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The relevant portions of s. 56 provide as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>56.&nbsp; (1) The board may, by resolution, make, amend or
    repeal by-laws, not contrary to this Act or to the declaration,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>                                      …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          (l) to govern the management of the property;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(m) to govern the use and
    management of the assets of the corporation;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(n) to specify duties of the corporation in addition to
    the duties set out in this Act and the declaration;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>                                      …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(p) to govern the conduct generally
    of the affairs of the corporation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>TSCC 2095 argues that the powers listed in s.
    56(1)(l), (m), (n) and (p) “are far too general to support the By-law
    authorizing the execution of the Agreement.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I acknowledge that the wording of these
    provisions is general. They grant very broad authority to the board of
    directors of a condominium corporation. Subsection (p) is particularly broad in
    that it provides that a by-law will be within the board’s by-law making power provided
    that it “governs the conduct generally of the affairs of the corporation”. I
    see no reason not to give effect to the words chosen by the legislature. TSCC
    2095 provides no case law in support of its argument that, because the power
    conferred is general, it ought to be ignored or somehow limited or read down.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    agreement is to arrange the affairs of the condominium corporation and, more
    specifically, its relationship with the declarant. By-Law No. 2 provides a
    framework within which the condominium corporation will deal with any and all
    outstanding or incomplete work and construction deficiencies. The decision by
    the board of directors of TSCC 2095 to limit the corporation’s options to
    making claims within the Tarion process is clearly an exercise in the
    governance of the affairs of the corporation.</span></p>

    the warranty agreement had not been entered into, it would have the
    jurisdiction to advance a claim against the declarant. If the corporation has
    the authority to advance a claim then, presumably, it has the authority to
    resolve any claim it might choose to advance. Surely, therefore, the corporation’s
    authority must extend to deciding that a claim will not be advanced, or that it
    will be advanced in a particular manner or venue, such as before the Tarion
    Warranty Corporation. In other words, deciding when to advance such claims, and
    in which forum, is part of “the conduct generally of the affairs of the
    corporation.” A by-law that governs the way in which the corporation is to
    advance such claims, whether it is adopted by the current board or by the
    declarant-appointed board, is therefore authorized by s. 56(1)(p), so long as
    it is not otherwise contrary to the <em>Condominium Act</em> or the

    impose obligations on TSCC 2095 to repair and maintain the property. The
    condominium’s power to make claims is provided in s. 23 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Condominium Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US> and that section
    includes a requirement that notice be given to owners before a claim is made. Section
    18 restricts a condominium board’s ability to dispose of personal property – including,
    in the TSCC 2095’s submission, a potential cause of action against the
    declarant – to dispositions “that are consistent with the objects and duties of
    the corporation”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In TSCC 2095’s submission, because By-Law No. 2

    imposed by ss. 89 and 90 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Condominium Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> and article 10.1 of the declaration. As a result, even if the

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not agree. Assuming that By-Law No. 2 and the
    warranty agreement constitute a disposition of personal property as contemplated
    in s. 18, the disposition is not inconsistent with TSCC 2095’s obligation to
    repair and maintain the property. As the declarant points out, the by-law and
    warranty agreement simply impose limits on the options that TSCC 2095 may have
    to pursue the declarant and seek recovery of any costs it may incur in carrying
    out its repair and maintenance obligations. The by-law and the warranty
    agreement do not restrict TSCC 2095’s repair and maintenance obligations; they
    simply circumscribe to a certain extent the manner in which TSCC 2095 will
    manage its resources and fund any repair and maintenance costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, s. 23 is also of no assistance to
    TSCC 2095. Section 23 simply provides that a condominium corporation “may”
    commence a claim for damage to common elements. There is no statutory requirement
    that a claim be made nor, as suggested by TSCC 2095, that unit owners need to
    receive notice should the condominium corporation decide not to advance such a
    claim. In any event, all of the unit owners have received proper disclosure of
    the limits placed on TSCC 2095’s ability to advance claims against the
    declarant.</span></p>
  <h6>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is By-Law No. 2 invalid because, in passing it, the directors breached

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>TSCC 2095 further argues that by passing By-Law
    No. 2 and entering into the agreement, the directors appointed by the declarant
    breached their statutory obligations. Section 37 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Condominium Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US> imposes on directors of
    condominium corporations obligations as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>37.&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Every director and every officer of a
    corporation in exercising the powers and discharging the duties of office
    shall,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          (a) act honestly and in good faith; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) exercise the care, diligence
    and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In TSCC 2095’s submission, by releasing the
    declarant from all liability other than the statutory minimum imposed by the <em>ONHWP
    Act</em>, the transitional board of directors appointed by the declarant
    disposed of an asset (the potential causes of action against the declarant) in
    a manner that was not consistent with the objects and duties of the condominium
    corporation. By passing the by-law and entering into the agreement, the
    directors fundamentally undermined the condominium corporation’s ability to
    ensure that repairs and maintenance necessitated by the declarant’s actions or
    inaction would be corrected and paid for by the declarant. Because no careful
    or diligent director cognizant of the condominium corporation’s obligations to
    maintain and repair the common elements would pass such a by-law, TSCC 2095
    submits that the by-law and the agreement are <em>ultra vires</em> as being
    contrary to s. 37. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I disagree. Section 37(1) creates a standard of
    care that applies to directors and officers and describes circumstances in
    which directors and officers of condominium corporations may be held personally
    liable for their acts. TSCC 2095 has cited no case in which s. 37(1) forms the
    basis for a finding that a particular by-law or resolution of a condominium
    board was <em>ultra vires</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the actions of the board initially
    appointed by the declarant must be viewed in context. In <em>Peel Condominium
    Corp. No. 417 v. Tedley Homes Ltd.</em> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 257 (C.A.), this
    court considered a condominium corporation’s application for rescission of an
    agreement between the corporation and the declarant requiring the corporation
    to purchase superintendent and guest units from the declarant. The corporation
    argued, in part, that the declarant-appointed directors on the corporation’s
    initial board had failed to disclose their conflict of interest and had
    breached their fiduciary duties. This court disagreed, stating at p. 264:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>These directors did no more than organize the affairs of the
    condominium in the manner anticipated by the declaration and agreed to by the
    purchasers of the individual units.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is the declarant, as developer of the
    property, who defines the content, character and structure of the condominium
    project. This is done through the filing of the declaration creating the
    condominium corporation as well as by having the founding board pass by-laws
    and enter into agreements structuring the condominium corporation and governing
    its operation. How the condominium project is structured will have an impact on
    the value and therefore, the selling price of the individual units. For
    example, if the superintendent’s suite and guest units are included as part of
    the common elements, the value of each of the condominium units sold to
    purchasers by the declarant will be higher than if the superintendent’s suite
    and guest units had to be purchased or rented from the declarant by the
    condominium corporation. Similarly, one could well expect that the declarant in
    this case, absent the protection of the warranty agreement, would seek to net a
    higher sale price for the units to compensate for the additional risk it would
    be assuming.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In implementing the structure determined by the
    declarant, the initial directors are not acting as fiduciaries for the
    purchasers of condominium units. Their role is not to try and obtain the best
    possible agreement for the condominium corporation or for the purchasers of
    units. As explained in <em>Tedley Homes</em>, at p. 264, their role is to
    “organize the affairs of the condominium in the manner anticipated by the declaration
    and agreed to by the purchasers of the individual units”, provided of course,
    that the directors are acting within the limits and constraints imposed by the <em>Condominium
    Act</em>. </span></p>

    earlier, contravene the <em>Condominium Act</em>. The by-law and agreement were
    disclosed to the individual unit purchasers and the by-law was placed on title
    giving notice to the world of its terms. In these circumstances, I see no basis
    for finding that in passing the by-law and entering into the warranty agreement
    the directors acted in violation of their duties or for concluding that the by-law

    on its earlier submissions to the effect that the by-law and agreement are inconsistent
    with the <em>Condominium Act</em> and the declaration. TSCC 2095 adds the further
    argument that the by-law and agreement do not meet the reasonableness
    requirements in ss. 56(6) and (7) because TSCC 2095 received no consideration
    for entering into the warranty agreement and because disclosure of the by-law
    and agreement was inadequate.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to TSCC 2095’s submission that the
    warranty agreement is unreasonable because TSCC 2095 received no consideration,
    I agree with the application judge’s finding that the consideration given was to
    be found in the declarant’s “agreement to transfer the project to the
    condominium corporation and the unit owners.” This is not to say that TSCC 2095
    exchanged its potential causes of action against the declarant in return for
    the transfer of the project, but rather that the warranty agreement was part of
    the structure of the condominium project imposed by the declarant before the
    declarant sold any of the units. Through the disclosure detailed above and the
    terms in the agreements of purchase and sale, the original purchasers were made
    aware of precisely what warranty came with their purchase.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <em>ONHWP Act</em> imposes on a declarant
    certain statutory warranty obligations. The degree to which a declarant would,
    at common law, be exposed to potential deficiency claims over and above those
    imposed by statute will, as noted earlier, invariably factor into the price at
    which the declarant is prepared to sell and the price a potential purchaser of
    units is prepared to pay. Through the disclosure of the by-law and agreement,
    both vendor and purchaser were fully informed of the terms of the bargain being
    proposed and the consideration they agreed to exchange on the purchase reflects
    those terms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>TSCC 2095 then suggests that because the
    warranties sought to be avoided by the declarant are in respect of common
    elements, the consideration for the warranty agreement should flow to TSCC 2095.
    In TSCC 2095’s submission, therefore, the consideration exchanged between the unit
    owners and the declarant cannot constitute consideration for TSCC 2095’s
    agreeing to the declarant limiting its exposure to warranty claims in respect
    of common elements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not agree. The consideration for the warranty
    agreement is to be found in the creation of the condominium project as a whole.
    The unit owners, as a group, own all of the common elements and their purchase
    from the declarant includes both the purchase of their respective units and, in
    the aggregate, the purchase of the common elements – common elements as defined
    and structured by the declaration as well as the resolutions and by-laws
    adopted by the initial board and disclosed to the purchasers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The purchase price reflects not only the value

    suggestion that inadequate disclosure somehow makes the by-law and agreement
    unreasonable. No claim has been advanced by a purchaser alleging that
    disclosure was inadequate. Nor has TSCC 2095 referred to any provision in the <em>Condominium
    Act</em> or jurisprudence that supports the submission that inadequate
    disclosure renders a by-law unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, the by-law and agreement were
    disclosed in both the declarant’s disclosure statement and in the agreements of
    purchase and sale signed by each of the original purchasers of units. Further,
    By-Law No. 2 was registered on title to give notice to all prospective
    purchasers. Should there be any issue as to the adequacy of this disclosure,
    there are provisions in the <em>Condominium Act</em> that offer remedies to affected

  <p class=Heading>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted by the declarant, TSCC 2095 has the
    benefit of the <em>ONHWP Act</em>. There is no suggestion that, when it entered
    into the agreement, the declarant knew of any deficiencies that would not be
    covered by the Tarion Warranty Corporation process. All of the construction
    deficiencies identified to date are being addressed within that process.
    Further, although I acknowledge that consumer protection is a significant
    purpose of the C<em>ondominium Act</em> (see <em>Lexington on the Green Inc. v.
    Toronto Standard Condominium Corp. No. 1930</em>, 2010 ONCA 751), all of the initial
    purchasers received notice of these arrangements prior to concluding their
    purchase. Finally, no evidence of deception, misfeasance or misrepresentation
    by the declarant has been advanced.</span></p>

    deficiencies in the manner done here. None of the provisions cited by TSCC
    2095, either individually or read in the context of the <em>Condominium Act</em> as a whole, prevents a declarant from entering into such an arrangement.</span></p>
