</span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent is a licensed trainer of standardbred horses
under the </span><em>Racing Commission Act, 2000</em>, S.O. 2000, c. 20. As
such, he is subject to the <span lang=EN-US>Ontario Racing Commission’s </span><em>Rules
of Standardbred Racing</em><span lang=EN-US>. On September 28, 2010, he was
videotaped by a hidden camera injecting something into the trachea of a horse
at the Windsor Raceway. The horse raced about an hour later and finished sixth
in that race. Subsequently, on November 7, 2010, the respondent was arrested as
he entered the grounds of the race track. A search of the respondent and his
truck following the arrest uncovered a syringe filled with performance-enhancing
drugs.</span></p>

</span>The syringe contained a combination of epinephrine and clenbuterol.
Although epinephrine and clenbuterol have legitimate therapeutic applications,
they can also be performance-enhancing drugs, depending on when and how they
are administered. As a result, their use as performance-enhancing drugs on race
day is prohibited.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The precise wording of the indictment in this case is important, because
as the trial judge found, the references to “the public” foreclosed the Crown
from relying on fraud or cheating directed at the other racers competing for
the race’s purse. Consequently, the issues at trial were argued entirely on
fraud or cheating directed at the public at large.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At trial, a veterinarian qualified to provide expert evidence testified
that a tracheal injection of epinephrine was made so as to cause the drug to
form a pool in the trachea of the horse and not be absorbed into the horse’s
blood vessels until the horse was stimulated by exercise, such as in a race. At
that point, the drug would be inhaled and absorbed quickly, providing the horse
with a potent stimulant.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Crown’s expert also testified that there was no legitimate medical
reason for the injection that was recorded by the hidden camera. The trial
judge accepted this evidence.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span lang=EN-US>In his reasons, the trial judge found that the
respondent had injected a prohibited performance-enhancing drug into the horse
on September 28, 2010, and that he had attempted to do the same on November 7,
2010. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the purpose of the injection
was to enhance the performance of the horse, and not for any therapeutic
purpose. The trial judge also found that the respondent was aware of the ban on
loaded syringes at race tracks, and had nonetheless surreptitiously brought
syringes containing banned substances onto the race track. In the trial judge’s
opinion, the injections were made “to create an unfair advantage” for the horse
the respondent had entered in the race.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite these findings, the trial judge
acquitted the respondent on all charges.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Concerning the fraud and attempted fraud charges,
the trial judge was satisfied that the respondent had acted deceitfully.
However, he found that the Crown had not proven deprivation beyond a reasonable
doubt. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge noted that the Crown argued that
the betting public was deprived of its bet or was at least at risk of being
deprived of its bet by the respondent’s deceit. However, he said that no
evidence had been led that any member of the betting public placed a bet
because they either knew or did not know about the injection. Moreover, the
betting public did not participate in the race, they “only wagered on the
outcome of it.” In the trial judge’s view, if anyone was deprived or at risk of
deprivation, it was the other participants in the race who were all racing for
the purses awarded to the winner. Yet that was not the fraud which the Crown
had particularized in its indictment, since the indictment referred exclusively
to “the public.” </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the same reasons, the trial judge found that
there was no causal connection between the respondent’s deceit and any
deprivation the public would have suffered. Even if there was a causal
connection, the trial judge relied on </span><em>R. v. Vézina</em><span
lang=EN-US>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2, to conclude that, assuming the betting public
had suffered deprivation, the deprivation was too remote. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the trial judge stated that the Crown
had not led evidence of the amounts bet on the races at issue. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Concerning the cheating while playing a game charges,
the trial judge found that horseracing is not a game within the meaning of s.
197 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US> because horseracing is
a game of pure skill that does not include an element of chance. </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the trial judge concluded that the
“betting public … [was] too remote [from the respondent’s] act of cheating.” He
observed that although the “betting public can win or lose their bet, the
betting public is not really a participant in the race.” Their bets are based
on bettors’ skill, or lack thereof, “acquire[d] by, among other things, reading
the racing form and assessing the chances of winning by reference to the
information listed in that form.” </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, in the trial judge’s view, “the betting
public was not deceived by [the respondent] cheating as they did not know about
it.” He said, “[t]here was no evidence that anybody placed any bet in reliance
or non-reliance on the fact that the horse may have been injected with a
performance enhancing drug.” However, having said that, the trial judge went on
to observe:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I venture to say that in light of [the
veterinarian’s] evidence, that if the betting public had known of the
injection, some might not have bet on the injected horse while others would,
depending on their views of the efficiency of performance enhancing drugs. It
would be but one of the various factors in addition to those enumerated in the
racing form which bettors used to inform their wager.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown appeals from the acquittals and argues
that the trial judge made several errors of law. The respondent submits that if
the trial judge made any errors, they were errors as to factual matters and
therefore not subject to appeal by the Crown.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Fraud Charges</span></h1>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Beginning with the fraud charges, it is
undisputed on appeal that evidence was led at trial indicating that bets in
excess of $5,000 were placed on both races. The trial judge’s statement that no
evidence was led on this matter constitutes an error in law because it
indicates that he failed to consider the whole of the evidence: </span><em>R.
v. J.M.H.</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 31.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown also argues that the trial judge erred
in law by concluding that the betting public was not put at risk of deprivation
by the respondent's actions and that the risk of deprivation was too remote.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Concerning the risk of deprivation issue, it was
established at trial that horse racing is a highly regulated industry and that
the regulatory scheme includes a ban on the presence of the
performance-enhancing drugs utilized by the respondent in the body of a horse
on race day. Given this regulatory scheme, bettors were entitled to bet on each
race assuming that no horse in the race was affected by such drugs.</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this regard, we agree with the Crown that the
horseracing bettors are in a similar position to the investors in </span><em>R.
v. Drabinsky</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2011 ONCA 582. Just as investors were
entitled to rely on the accuracy of the financial statements, bettors were
entitled to assume compliance with the regulatory scheme. What occurred in this
case was not a minor breach or minor non-compliance with the regulatory scheme.
Where there is an attempt (successful or not) to affect the outcome of a race
through the use of banned performance-enhancing substances, such a significant
breach of the regulatory scheme necessarily places bettors at risk of being
deprived of their bets. Indeed, as the trial judge found, the very purpose of
the injection was to create “an unfair advantage” for the respondent’s horse. It
is obvious that a horse injected with performance-enhancing drugs could run
differently than if it was not so injected; in fact, that appears to be at
least part of the reason for the prohibition.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, as in </span><em>Drabinsky</em><span
lang=EN-US>, where there is a failure to disclose material non-compliance with
the regulatory scheme, it is no answer to say bettors may have relied on other
factors in making their bets. Bettors were entitled to assume compliance with
the regulatory scheme when weighing those others factors and coming to a final
decision. Non-compliance with the regulatory scheme in a manner so as to affect
the outcome of a race necessarily puts the bettors’ economic interests at risk.
Bettors were deprived of information about the race that they were entitled to
know; they were also deprived of an honest race run in accordance with the
rules. In these circumstances, the trial judge erred in law because he failed
to take account of the regulatory scheme in considering the risk of deprivation

person who cheats while playing a game “with intent to defraud any person” is
guilty of an offence. The words “any person” would clearly encompass any person
betting on a race, and not just those participating in a race. Further, it is

were entitled to rely on compliance with the regulatory scheme. It is no answer
to say they also relied on other factors in making their bets. As the trial
judge observed in this section of his reasons addressing cheating while playing
a game, had they known about the doping, some bettors would likely have changed
their behavior, while others would not. Thus, as a group, the betting public
was deprived of information about the race that they were entitled to know;
they were also deprived of an honest race run in accordance with the rules. As
we said in the previous section of these reasons, in our view, the trial judge
erred in law in failing to consider the regulatory scheme in relation to the

trial, the evidence showed that post position is determined by a computerized
random post position generator and that certain post positions are more
advantageous than others in that the advantageous positions provide shorter
distances of travel. The Crown argues that these requirements and this evidence
