  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the finding of guilt made by Justice Norman
    S. Douglas of the Ontario Court of Justice on April 13, 2011.</p>
  <p class=Heading><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>By the
    Court:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 24, 2009, the 17-year-old complainant
    and the 16-year-old appellant engaged in consensual oral sex. At trial, both
    testified that they had vaginal intercourse after an unsuccessful attempt at
    anal intercourse. According to the complainant, she told the appellant that she
    did not wish to lose her virginity and that she did not consent to intercourse.
    Although the appellant acknowledged that the complainant told him that she did
    not wish to lose her virginity, he testified that she went along with it and
    did not object or show any sign of not wanting it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found the appellant guilty of
    sexual assault. The appellant raised two issues on his appeal from that finding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant argued that the trial judge
    erred by applying differing levels of scrutiny to his evidence and that of the
    complainant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We did not call on the Crown to respond to this
    argument. As this court noted in </span><em>R. v. Howe</em><span lang=EN-US> (2005), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 480, at para. 59, [t]his is a difficult argument to
    make successfully. That is because, as Doherty J.A. stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It is not enough to show that a different
    judge could have reached a different credibility assessment, or that the trial
    judge failed to say something that he could have said in assessing the
    respective credibility of the complainant and the accused, or that he failed to
    expressly set out legal principles relevant to that credibility assessment. To
    succeed in this kind of argument, the appellant must point to something in the
    reasons of the trial judge or perhaps elsewhere in the record that make it
    clear that the trial judge had applied different standards in assessing the
    evidence of the appellant and the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the appellant did not meet this
    high threshold. Rather, in our view, his arguments were an attempt to have us
    reweigh the evidence that was before the trial judge. That is not our function. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant argued there has been a
    miscarriage of justice due to ineffective assistance of counsel. In this
    regard, he acknowledged that an appeal based on ineffective assistance of
    counsel has a performance component and a prejudice component. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For an appeal to succeed on this ground, an
    appellant must show that counsels acts or omissions constituted incompetence
    and second, that a miscarriage of justice resulted: </span><em>R. v. G.D.B.</em>, <span lang=EN-US>2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 26. The test for
    establishing incompetence is a strict one; the appellant must show that the
    acts or omissions of counsel could not have been the result of reasonable
    professional judgment: </span><em>R. v. Prebtani</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2008
    ONCA 735, 240 C.C.C. (3d) 237, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2009]
    S.C.C.A. No. 153, at para. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In assessing a claim for ineffective assistance
    of counsel, this court must first determine whether a miscarriage of justice
    has occurred. If not, then the performance component generally ought not to be considered: </span><em>G.D.B.</em>,<span lang=EN-US> at para. 29; </span><em>R. v. Prebtani</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 4. In </span><em>G.D.B.</em>, <span lang=EN-US>the Supreme
    Court of Canada suggested two ways in which counsels performance may result in
    a miscarriage of justice: procedural unfairness or an unreliable verdict: at
    para. 28. As Rosenberg J.A. wrote for this court in </span><em>Prebtani</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 4:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>An example of procedural unfairness is where counsel
    failed to obtain instructions before embarking on a course of </span>defence<span
lang=EN-US> in circumstances where counsel was bound to obtain instructions.
    The unreliability of the verdict is made out where the appellant can establish
    that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different
    had the appellant received effective legal representation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, the appellant asserts that trial counsels
    decision not to pursue a s. 11(b) </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US> application for a stay of proceedings could not have been the result of
    reasonable professional judgment. The appellant argues that this resulted in a
    miscarriage of justice, because, first, it deprived the appellant of a remedy
    to which there is a reasonable possibility he would have been entitled  namely,
    a stay of the proceedings  and, second, because the appellant suffered
    procedural unfairness when trial counsel embarked on a course of conduct 
    namely, not pursuing a s. 11(b) application  without his instructions. The
    appellant submits that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of the delay in
    this matter because of the stress and depression that he claims to have experienced
    while awaiting his trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In response to the appellants allegations,
    trial counsel asserted that he made a strategic decision not to rush to a trial
    date because, in his experience, young complainants sometimes recant their
    evidence as memories of an incident fade. He was therefore of the view that it
    was not in the appellants interest to seek an early trial date. Accordingly,
    he did not attempt to lay a foundation in the record for a s. 11(b)
    application. In these circumstances, he considered that bringing such an
    application would appear frivolous and serve only to agitate the presiding
    judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We begin with the issue of whether the appellant
    was deprived of a remedy to which there is a reasonable possibility he would have
    been entitled. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The framework for conducting a s. 11(b) analysis
    is well-known: see, for example, </span><em>R. v. Tran</em>, 2012 ONCA 18, 288
    C.C.C. (3d) 177, at paras. 20-24; <em>R. v. Florence</em>, 2014 ONCA 443, 312
    C.C.C. (3d) 165, at paras. 29-31.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, in total, there was delay of just over 20 months
    between the appellants arrest and his trial. <span lang=EN-US>The chronology
    of events is as follows:</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that just over 20 months of delay from arrest until trial would have
    attracted the trial courts scrutiny. Further, we acknowledge that youth court
    matters are expected to proceed with greater dispatch than adult criminal
    proceedings: <em>R. v. M. (G.C.)</em> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 223 (C.A.), at p. 230;
    see also <em>R. v. R. (T.N.)</em> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 645 (C.A.), at paras. 28-31.
    As Osborne J.A. stated in <em>R. v. M. (G.C.)</em>, in general, youth court
    cases should be brought to trial within five to six months, after the neutral
    period required to retain and instruct counsel, obtain disclosure, <em>etc.</em>:
    at p. 236<span lang=EN-US>.</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>Nonetheless, we are
    not satisfied that the appellant has established a reasonable possibility that
    a stay would have been granted had a s. 11(b) application been brought.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin by noting that, because the appellant did not bring a s. 11(b)
    application at trial, we do not have the benefit of the record that would have
    been filed or the submissions of trial counsel that would have been made had
    such an application been brought. In these circumstances, we can only estimate
    how the delay might have been allocated had a s. 11(b) application been made at
    trial. We have examined the transcripts of the set date proceedings and the
    information about available dates that appellate counsel has been able to
    obtain. We note, however, that, in many instances, the record does not reveal
    the courts or counsels first available dates for next steps  information
    which can be critical in allocating responsibility for delay: see <em>R. v.
    Tran</em>, at paras. 54-61; <em>R. v. Florence</em>, at paras. 55 and 63. In
    the circumstances, our best estimate is as follows:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>Aug. 5, 2009
    to Nov. 4, 2009               3 months: intake, neutral</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>Nov. 4, 2009 to Dec. 2, 2009               28 days: inherent time
    requirements of the case (review of disclosure; arranging and preparing for
    Crown pre-trial)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>Dec. 2, 2009 to Dec. 23, 2009             21 days: Crown delay (delay
    in disclosure)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>Dec. 23, 2009 to March 26, 2010         3 months 3 days: combination of
    inherent time requirements of the case to arrange and prepare for judicial
    pre-trial and defence delay (defence request for later pre-trial). In the
    absence of specific information concerning these issues we allocate the delay
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>                                                          1 month 18
    days: inherent time requirements or neutral</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:

    days: defence delay</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:

    of inherent time requirements of the case (to allow counsel to clear their
    schedules and prepare for trial) and institutional delay. In the absence of
    specific information concerning counsels first available dates, we allocate
    the delay as follows:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>2 months:
    inherent time requirements of the case</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we have assessed responsibility for the delay as follows:</p>

    delay                      10 days</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    acknowledge that our estimate of the combination of Crown and institutional
    delay in this matter totalling five months and 10 days is significant. We also
    recognize the possibility that, with the benefit of defence submissions, a
    larger portion of the delay that we have attributed to the inherent time
    requirements of the case might have been attributed differently on a s. 11(b)
    application. Nonetheless, this establishes only that the appellant has not met
    his onus of proof on appeal. Moreover, even assuming that result and that there
    was actual prejudice to the appellant resulting from delay, we are still not
    satisfied that, in the face of four months and one day of defence delay, a s.
    11(b) application would have had a reasonable chance of success.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    explanation was provided for the defence request for a later pre-trial; none of
    the set date transcripts demonstrate any concern on the part of the appellant
    about the delay that was occurring; and part of the defence delay in scheduling
    the trial was a result of the appellants having missed an appointment with
    counsel. Finally, the record does not reveal any explanation for the delay surrounding
    the CFS report. That report established only that there were traces of semen on
    the complainants clothing. It is unclear from the record who thought obtaining
    that report should delay trial scheduling and why. Nonetheless, we have
    attributed the entire period of that delay to the Crown.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    we do not condone the Crown and institutional delay that took place, we are not
    satisfied, in the face of the defence delays, that the appellant has
    demonstrated that a s. 11(b) application would have had a reasonable chance of
    success. The charge in this case was serious. The defence delays undermined any
    assertion that the appellant was seeking a trial within a reasonable time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the appellants claim that he suffered procedural unfairness as a result of
    trial counsels embarking on a course of conduct without his (the appellants)
    instructions, we cannot accept this submission. Even assuming that trial
    counsel had an obligation to seek the appellants instructions as to whether to
    press for his right to a trial within a reasonable time from the outset and
    ultimately to bring a s.11(b) application, the appellant has not demonstrated
    that trial counsels failure to do so caused a miscarriage of justice. Had the
    appellant instructed trial counsel to press for a speedy trial from the outset,
    a speedier trial may have ensued. The appellant has not led evidence to
    demonstrate otherwise.</p>

    the result, we conclude that the appellant has failed to demonstrate a
    miscarriage of justice. It is therefore unnecessary, and inappropriate, for us
    to address the question of whether trial counsel fell below the requisite
    standard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
