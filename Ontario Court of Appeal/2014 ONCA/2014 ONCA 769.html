    at trial, and as a result, erroneously concluded the Crown had proven its case

    the abuse consisted of acts of oral sex occurring at least once and,
    eventually, two or three times a week. The incidents occurred, for the most
    part, in an upstairs hallway in the family home. From there, A.M. could see

  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>The Governing
    Principles </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several basic principles inform our decision regarding the trial judge's
    reasons for judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, every witness, irrespective of age, is an individual whose
    credibility and evidence should be assessed according to criteria appropriate
    to his or her mental development, understanding, and ability to communicate: <em>R.
    v. W. (R.)</em>,<em> </em>[1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 134. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    no inflexible rules mandate when a witness' evidence should be evaluated
    according to &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;child&quot; standards. Indeed, in its provisions regarding
    testimonial capacity, the <em>Canada Evidence Act</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5,
    eschews any reference to &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;child&quot;, preferring the terms &quot;14 years or
    older&quot; and &quot;under 14 years of age'. An inflexible, category-based system would
    resurrect stereotypes as rigid and unyielding as those rejected by the recent
    developments in our approach to children's evidence: <em>W. (R.)</em>, at p.
    134. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    despite this flexibility, there are some guiding principles. Generally, where
    an adult testifies about events that occurred when she was a child, her
    credibility should be assessed according to the criteria applicable to adult
    witnesses. However, the presence of inconsistencies, especially on peripheral
    matters such as time and location, should be considered in the context of her
    age at the time the events about which she is testifying occurred: <em>W. (R.)</em>,
    at p. 134. See also, <em>R. v. Kendall</em>, [1962] S.C.R. 469. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    one of the most valuable means of assessing witness credibility is to examine
    the consistency between what the witness said in the witness box and what she
    has said on other occasions, whether or not under oath: <em>R. v. G. (M.)</em> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 347 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 354, leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused, [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 390. Inconsistencies may emerge in a witness'
    testimony at trial, or between their trial testimony and statements previously given.
    Inconsistencies may also emerge from things said differently at different
    times, or from omitting to refer to certain events at one time while referring
    to them on other occasions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inconsistencies
    vary in their nature and importance. Some are minor, others are not. Some
    concern material issues, others peripheral subjects. Where an inconsistency
    involves something material about which an honest witness is unlikely to be
    mistaken, the inconsistency may demonstrate a carelessness with the truth about
    which the trier of fact should be concerned: <em>G. (M.)</em>, at p. 354. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    A trial judge giving reasons for judgment is neither under the obligation to
    review and resolve every inconsistency in a witness' evidence, nor respond to
    every argument advanced by counsel: <em>R. v</em>. <em>M. (R.E.)</em>, 2008 SCC
    51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 64. That said, a trial judge should address and
    explain how she or he has resolved major inconsistencies in the evidence of
    material witnesses: <em>G. (M.)</em>, at p. 356; <em>R. v. Dinardo</em>, 2008
    SCC 24, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 788, at para. 31. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth,
    prior consistent statements of a witness are not admissible for their truth: <em>R.
    v. Stirling</em>, 2008 SCC 10, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 272, at para. 7. Mere repetition
    of a story on a prior occasion does not make the in-court description of the
    events any more credible or reliable: <em>R. v. Curto</em>, 2008 ONCA 161, 230
    C.C.C. (3d) 145, at paras. 32, 35; <em>R. v. Ay</em> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 456
    (B.C.C.A.), at p. 471.&nbsp; </p>

  <p class=BContinuingPara>reveal the basis for the verdict reached: <em>M.
    (R.E.)</em>, at para. 55; <em>R. v. Vuradin</em>, 2013 SCC 38, [2013] 2 S.C.R.
    639, at paras. 12, 15. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eighth,
    where a case turns largely on determinations of credibility, the sufficiency of
    reasons must be considered in light of the deference generally afforded to
    trial judges on credibility findings. It is rare for deficiencies in a trial
    judge's credibility analysis, as expressed in the reasons for judgment, to
    warrant appellate intervention: <em>Vuradin</em>, at para. 11; <em>Dinardo</em>,
    at para. 26. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    the failure of a trial judge to sufficiently articulate how credibility and
    reliability concerns are resolved may constitute reversible error: <em>Vuradin</em>,
    at para. 11; <em>Dinardo</em>, at para. 26; <em>R. v. Braich</em>, 2002 SCC 27,
    [2002] 1 S.C.R. 903, at para. 23. After all, an accused is entitled to know why
    the trial judge had no reasonable doubt about his or her guilt: <em>R. v.
    Gagnon</em>, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para. 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    we take it as self-evident that a legal error made in the assessment of
    credibility may displace the deference usually afforded to a trial judge's
    credibility assessment and may require appellate intervention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    when evaluating a trial judge's credibility analysis, there is no principled
    reason to distinguish between cases involving oath against oath from those in
    which no competing oath has been offered. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>The Principles Applied</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the reasons of the trial judge, read as a whole and in the context of
    the issues raised and evidence given at trial, reveal legal error in his
    assessment of the evidence. Although we acknowledge that deficiencies in a
    trial judge's credibility analysis rarely merit appellate intervention (<em>Vuradin</em>,
    at para. 11; <em>Dinardo</em>, at para. 26), in this case, the trial judge's
    reasons are fatally flawed. As a result, the conviction cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as in many, the ultimate result turned largely on the trial judge's
    assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the reliability of their
    evidence. The Crown's case against A.M. stood or fell on the basis of the
    complainant's evidence. However, her credibility was impeached and the reliability
    of her evidence challenged. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    it was essential to a fair trial that the trial judge apply the proper legal
    principles to evaluate her testimony, articulate how the credibility concerns
    were resolved, and explain why her testimony left him with no reasonable doubt
    of A.M.'s guilt: <em>Gagnon</em>, at para. 21; <em>Vuradin</em>, at para. 11; <em>Dinardo</em>,
    at para. 26; <em>Braich</em>, at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge's credibility analysis is marred by two principal
    legal errors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge assessed the complainant's evidence as if she were a &quot;child&quot;
    witness. She was not. The complainant was 19 years old when she testified at
    trial about abuse that extended over a decade, until about her 17<sup>th</sup> birthday. Her testimony was that of an adult regarding events that first
    occurred when she was a child and continued well into her teenage years. The
    trial judge was obliged to assess her credibility according to the criteria
    applicable to adult witnesses, not the somewhat lessened standard of scrutiny
    associated with child witnesses: <em>W. (R.)</em>, at p. 134; <em>R. v. Gostick</em> (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 53 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 12-13; <em>R. v. S. (D.D.)</em>,
    2006 NSCA 34, 207 C.C.C. (3d) 319, at para. 54. While the trial judge was
    entitled to apply a less exacting standard to peripheral matters that occurred
    during the complainant's childhood, he erred in assessing the complainant's
    credibility as if she were testifying as a &quot;child&quot;: <em>W. (R.)</em>, at p.
    134-135.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge characterized an admitted &quot;exaggeration&quot; by the complainant
    under oath at the preliminary inquiry as &quot;hyperbole, a common form of literary
    emphasis&quot; and thus &quot;a badge of credibility&quot;. The admitted exaggeration was a
    prior inconsistent statement about a material issue given under oath. It is
    difficult to see how a prior statement under oath inconsistent with sworn
    testimony at trial, especially regarding a material issue, could serve as a
    credibility enhancer. At best, the exaggeration reflects a carelessness for the
    truth when testifying under oath. Left unexplained, this would tend to impeach
    the witness' credibility rather than enhance it: <em>R. v. G. (M.)</em>, at p.
    354.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the conviction cannot stand. In a case that turned on findings
    of credibility and an assessment of reliability, the trial judge's credibility
    analysis reflected fundamental legal errors and ultimately failed to
    sufficiently explain how the credibility and reliability concerns were
    resolved. The appeal is allowed, the conviction and conditional stay set aside,
    and a new trial directed on the counts of sexual assault and sexual
    interference. </p>
