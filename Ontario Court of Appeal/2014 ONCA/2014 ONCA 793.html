    October 15, 2013 and November 8, 2013 and December 23, 2013.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Simmons
    J.A:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises out of the trial of a commercial action between the
    respondents, Stephen Chan and Hazelton Lanes Inc. (“Hazelton”), and the appellants,
    John Faraci and 1707590 Ontario Limited (“170”). Respondents’ counsel originally
    estimated that the trial would last three days. Rather than three days, the
    trial consumed about 50 days of court time, consisting of about 30 days of
    evidence and about 20 days of motions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even though the trial had consumed so much court time, the trial judge
    did not decide the case on the merits.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, on what was to have been day 36 of the trial, he permitted the
    respondents to add several defendants and new causes of action, including fraud
    and conspiracy. In addition, he granted to the respondents an <em>ex parte
    Mareva</em> injunction against the appellants and the added parties based on
    findings that all <em>had engaged</em> in a “fraudulent scheme” to hide assets. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge ordered the appellants to “comply fully” within
    six business days with 19 directions that the trial judge had given to Faraci during
    his cross-examination. These directions required Faraci to obtain, produce and
    organize for inspection masses of documents that had never previously been
    requested. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Faraci and 170 produced many documents and made them available
    for inspection, the trial judge made a finding, on a subsequent motion, that
    Faraci and 170 were in contempt for failing to comply <em>fully</em><i> </i>with
    the 19 directions. As a remedy for their contempt, the trial judge ordered Faraci
    and 170 to post $35,000 as security for costs. When that order was not complied
    with, the trial judge struck the appellants’ statement of defence and
    counterclaim and ultimately granted partial default judgment, by way of two
    judgments and one order, on all major aspects of the respondents’ original
    claims against the appellants. In addition, the trial judge awarded the respondents
    $650,000 in costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal five orders and judgments made by the trial judge: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the order finding the appellants in contempt for failing to comply fully
    with the trial judge’s mid-trial directions concerning production of documents;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the order striking out the appellants’ statement of defence and
    counterclaim;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>two judgments and one order granting the respondents partial default
    judgment on their original claims against the appellants together with $650,000
    in costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise several issues on appeal, including: loss of
    jurisdiction due to reasonable apprehension of bias; lack of evidence capable
    of proving contempt; misapplication of the rules relating to default judgment;
    insufficiency of reasons; and failure to apply the principles of
    proportionality and reasonableness in awarding costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the issue of reasonable apprehension of bias is dispositive
    of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning that issue, the appellants submit that the trial judge
    demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of bias through a number of actions,
    including: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>his interjections during Faraci’s cross-examination; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>his suggestion to respondents’ counsel that he move for a <em>Mareva</em> injunction;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>his mid-trial findings in his reasons on the motion for a <em>Mareva</em> injunction and related rulings that Faraci and the added defendants committed
    fraud and that Faraci’s testimony was not credible;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>his 19 mid-trial directions to Faraci and 170 to produce masses
    of documents not previously requested and of little or unknown relevance to the
    issues at trial;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>his mid-trial finding that Faraci and 170 were in contempt for
    failing to comply <em>fully</em> with his 19 directions relating to production
    of documents – when he did not advert to Faraci’s evidence concerning
    substantial compliance with the directions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that, when considered cumulatively, the
    trial judge’s conduct of the trial creates an appearance that he prejudged
    Faraci’s conduct and credibility and aligned himself with the respondents on
    the issue of mid-trial production in a manner that rendered the trial unfair.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias, set
    aside the judgments and orders under appeal and order a new trial before a
    different trial judge.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    fully appreciate the allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias, it is
    necessary to have some understanding of the relationship between the parties,
    the issues at trial and the events at trial. After reviewing these matters, I
    will turn to the specific allegations concerning reasonable apprehension of
    bias.</p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The Parties and Their
    Relationship</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faraci
    is a lawyer and the sole shareholder, officer and director of 170.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stephen
    Chan is a businessman and the controlling shareholder and directing mind of
    Hazelton. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faraci
    and Chan met in 1993 or 1994. For many years, Faraci acted as a solicitor for
    Chan and some of Chan’s companies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1999, Faraci acted for Chan and one of his companies, Combi Capital Group
    Limited (“Combi”), in connection with the purchase of commercial premises in
    Toronto commonly referred to as Hazelton Lanes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is undisputed that Faraci negotiated a 3% interest in Hazelton Lanes for
    himself around the time of Combi’s purchase of Hazelton Lanes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    2001 and 2011, first Faraci, and then 170, leased office space in Hazelton
    Lanes, initially from Combi and later from Hazelton.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The Relationship
    Between Faraci and Chan Deteriorates</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    least according to Faraci, in recent years, the relationship between him and
    Chan had begun to deteriorate. In 2006, another law firm acted when Combi
    transferred Hazelton Lanes to Hazelton. Hazelton and Chan claimed that Faraci’s
    3% interest in Hazelton was paid out around that time by a net payment of $376,686.45.
    Although Faraci acknowledges receipt of that payment, he claims that his 3%
    interest in Hazelton Lanes continued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faraci
    states that, by June 2011, his relationship with Chan had fallen apart.
    Anticipating a sale of Hazelton Lanes, he sued Chan and Hazelton in another
    proceeding, claiming a 3% ownership interest in the premises.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that same month, June 2011, Faraci obtained an order in the other proceeding
    requiring that $1,000,000 from the proceeds of the sale of Hazelton Lanes be
    paid into court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is undisputed that, on October 17, 2011, Hazelton re-entered 170’s rented
    premises and purported to terminate 170’s lease for non-payment of rent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Nor is it disputed that, on October 19, 2011, Hazleton Lanes was sold
    to First Capital Holdings (Ontario) Corporation (“First Capital”) for $108,000,000. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Under the terms of the June 2011 order, $1,000,000 from the proceeds
    of that sale was paid into court to the credit of the other action.</span></p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The Issues at Trial</h3>
  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     Chan and Hazelton’s
    Claim Against Faraci and 170</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 19, 2011, the same day Hazelton Lanes was sold, Hazelton and Chan
    commenced this proceeding against 170 and Faraci <span lang=EN-US>by notice of
    application. On December 23, 2011, a consolidation order was made joining their
    application with other pending proceedings. Under the terms of the
    consolidation order, Hazelton and Chan were to be plaintiffs and 170 and Faraci
    were to be defendants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    set out in their original statement of claim, Hazelton and Chan claimed, among
    other things, the following relief:</p>

    on account of legal fees without his consent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During

    subletting the rented premises without the landlord’s consent.</p>

    Statement of Defence and Counterclaim</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their original statement of defence and counterclaim, 170 and Faraci denied
    that Hazelton and Chan were entitled to any relief. Instead, they advanced the
    following version of the material facts.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>     The Lease Arrangements
    and Termination of 170’s Tenancy</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2001, at the request of Chan, Faraci relocated his law office to Hazelton
    Lanes. As a result of their relationship and because of Faraci’s 3% ownership
    interest, Chan advised Faraci that Faraci could lease office space in Hazelton
    Lanes rent free.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    to implement this arrangement, and to maximize the income of Hazelton Lanes on
    its books and records, Faraci’s lease required that rent be paid at an inflated
    rate. In addition, Chan directed Faraci to bill him for services in an amount
    equivalent to the monthly rent stipulated in Faraci’s lease and to use the
    payments on account to pay the rent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2006, just before the expiry of Faraci’s lease, an agreement was made for a new
    five-year lease under which 170 became the tenant. Certain handwritten amendments
    were made to the proposed Hazelton–170 lease, adding the following terms: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>upon the expiry of the initial five-year term, 170 would be
    entitled to renew the lease for a further five-year term at market rent less 20
    percent; and </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all rental payments under the lease and the renewal term would be
    paid by the landlord.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
    December 2010, Faraci’s rapport with Chan began to suffer. With the exception
    of one cheque received in February 2011, the payments from Chan and his
    companies to cover 170’s rent stopped thereafter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    two occasions after December 2010, 170 paid (under protest) amounts that Hazelton
    claimed were owing for rental arrears. In addition, 170 purported to exercise its
    option to renew the lease. However, 170 and Faraci declined to pay an amount that
    Hazelton demanded on account of rental arrears on or about October 3, 2011. On
    October 17, 2011, two days before the sale of Hazelton Lanes, Hazelton
    re-entered the rented premises and purported to terminate 170’s lease for
    non-payment of rent. However, as Chan and his companies had failed to honour
    their obligations to pay 170’s rent, Faraci and 170 claimed that Hazelton had terminated
    170’s lease improperly.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>     The Fee
    Agreements</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Faraci and 170, Faraci stopped providing legal services on a regular basis
    for Chan and his companies around October 2008. Nonetheless, from November 2008
    onward, 170 continued to send monthly statements of account to Chan or his
    companies for rental payments, described as “general services”, and 170
    continued to apply the payments received on account of monthly rent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among
    other things, Faraci denies that Chan or his companies paid Faraci $375,163.05
    in legal fees. Rather, a large portion of the payments were on account of rent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Faraci acknowledges that there were written “Service Contracts” for all or part
    of 2006, 2007 and 2008, he denies that any such agreements were in place for the
    balance of 2008 or any part of 2009 or 2010. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Faraci, between September 2006 and October 2008 he received $149,248.94 on
    account of legal services from Chan or his companies. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>(iii)</span>     The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faraci
    acknowledges that, on April 15, 1998, Chan advanced $20,000 to him as a deposit
    to be paid to a realtor in relation to a real estate transaction. The
    transaction did not close and litigation against the vendor ensued. According
    to Faraci, on June 5, 1998, Chan instructed him to apply the $20,000 on account
    of Faraci’s legal fees – which Faraci subsequently did. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their counterclaim, Faraci and 170 claim, among other things, the following

  <p class=AParaNumbering>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a declaration that the version of the lease governing the relationship
    between Hazelton and 170 is that set out in Schedule “A” to the statement of
    defence and counterclaim (this version includes handwritten amendments setting
    out the renewal option and the requirement that the landlord pay the rent);</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>declarations and other relief concerning the allegedly improper
    termination of the lease between Hazelton and 170. In particular, 170 claims a
    declaration that it is entitled to monies originally paid into escrow when
    Hazelton Lanes was sold to First Capital to account for its claim for a
    five-year renewal option. The funds were later paid into court to the credit of
    this action.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

lang=EN-US>The appeal record does not include transcripts of the proceedings

    their witnesses began testifying on April 18, 2012 and continued over 11 days
    (April 19, 20, 23, 24, June 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, and October 9, 2012). Chan’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Hazelton and Chan, the case for Faraci and 170 began on October 10, 2012. Faraci’s
    examination-in-chief consumed 27.1 hours over eight court days (October 10, 12,
    15, 17, 18, 19, November 19, 20 and 21, 2012); his cross-examination occurred

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 21, 2012, soon after Faraci’s cross-examination began, the trial judge
    interjected and made comments to the effect that Faraci’s evidence “defie[d]
    common sense” and was “gobbledygook”. I will describe these interjections in
    greater detail in the analysis section of these reasons. </p>
  <h6>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The Trial Judge Makes
    Mid-Trial Directions</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    many factors undoubtedly contributed to the length of this trial, at least part
    of the explanation lies in the fact that, prior to trial, Hazelton and Chan
    took the position that many events preceding 2006 on which Faraci and 170
    relied were irrelevant. Hazelton and Chan therefore refused production in
    relation to those issues. At trial, the trial judge ruled against the
    respondents’ position, leading respondents’ counsel to seek and obtain
    directions for production of documents during Faraci’s cross-examination that
    had not previously been requested during the pre-trial production and discovery
    process.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    factor is that, during Faraci’s cross-examination, the trial judge permitted
    respondents’ counsel to conduct what was effectively a judgment-debtor
    examination of Faraci because Faraci acknowledged that other parties had paid
    some of 170’s rent and because Faraci claimed that 170 could have paid the
    rental arrears Hazelton had demanded on October 3, 2011.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, during his cross-examination of Faraci, respondents’ counsel sought
    and obtained, over the objections of appellants’ counsel, 19 directions from
    the trial judge requiring the appellants to obtain, produce and organize for
    respondents’ counsel’s inspection masses of documents that had never 
    previously been requested.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
    of the directions overlapped. A consolidated summary of all the directions is

    directions the trial judge gave to Faraci during his cross-examination. Among
    other things, the trial judge ordered Faraci to:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>produce his personal income tax returns from 1998 to 2009, and,
    if necessary, make enquiries of his accountant to obtain copies of the same,
    and, if still necessary, request complete copies of all tax returns since 1998
    from the Canada Revenue Agency;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>produce copies of any information and documents used in the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Friday, February 1, 2013, respondents’ counsel indicated that he intended to
    complete his cross-examination of Faraci on Monday, February 4, 2013 and that,
    in addition, he intended to bring a mid-trial motion for costs. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge had previously said he was not prepared to make a mid-trial
    order for costs, respondents’ counsel asserted that evidence given by Faraci
    suggesting that he and 170 had made themselves judgment proof warranted a
    reconsideration of the issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, the trial judge said that an order “that would impede Mr. Faraci’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faraci’s

    the next court date, Wednesday, February 6, 2013, Hazelton and Chan brought a
    motion seeking to amend their statement of claim by adding five new defendants
    and several new causes of action, a <em>Mareva</em> injunction against all
    defendants and an order bifurcating the current trial from the trial of the
    amended claims. The motion was brought without notice to the new defendants.
    Because notice to 170 and Faraci had been given only minutes before the hearing
    commenced, the trial judge treated the motion as <em>ex parte</em> with respect
    to all defendants.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 7, 2013, the trial judge released an endorsement permitting Hazelton
    and Chan to amend their statement of claim and granting their request for a
    temporary <em>ex parte Mareva</em> injunction against all defendants. I will
    return to this endorsement in the analysis section of these reasons. However,
    in essence, the trial judge made findings that Faraci and the added defendants
    had engaged in a fraudulent scheme to hide assets and that, in these
    circumstances, Faraci’s participation in the trial was an “abuse [of] the civil
    justice system” because he was “engaging it without any financial risk.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span

    consideration at the conclusion of the trial. He denied Hazelton and Chan’s
    request for certificates of pending litigation against properties owned by the
    added defendants. However, he ordered Faraci to “comply fully with all orders

    the efforts he had made to obtain other documents and the documents he had been
    unable to find or obtain.</p>

    striking their statement of defence and counterclaim, as had been requested,
    the trial judge ordered that 170 and Faraci pay $35,000 into court on or before

    appellants asserted that the trial judge lost jurisdiction due to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias prior to making the September 16, 2013 order. Among other
    grounds, the appellants asserted that the trial judge failed to give reasons

    been better had [he] used different language [in his ruling on the <em>Mareva</em> injunction] to dispel any inference that [he] had made a finding of fraud
    against Faraci.” However, he said his “intention was to convey only that there
    was ‘strong <em>prima facie</em> evidence’ of a fraudulent scheme by Faraci.” On
    October 15, 2013, the trial judge struck out the appellants’ statement of

  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasonable apprehension of bias</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for reasonable apprehension of bias is that set out in de Grandpré J.’s
    dissenting opinion in&nbsp;<em>Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada
    (National Energy Board)</em>&nbsp;(1976), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369&nbsp;(S.C.C.), at
    pp. 394-95, which reads as follows:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[T]he&nbsp;apprehension&nbsp;of
    bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons,
    applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required
    information…. [The] test is “what would an informed person, viewing the matter
    realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude.
    Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker],
    whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly endorsed this test. In his reasons in <em>R.
    v. S. (R. D.)</em>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, Cory J. explained, at para. 111, that
    the test set down by de Grandpré J. in <em>Committee for Justice and Liberty</em> contains a “two-fold objective element”: not only must the person considering
    the alleged bias be reasonable, but “the apprehension of bias itself must also
    be reasonable in the circumstances of the case.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    has also been held that, in order to maintain public confidence in the
    administration of justice, the appearance of judicial impartiality is as important
    as the reality. In<i> <em>Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd. v. Lannon</em></i>,
    [1968] 3 All E.R. 304 (C.A.), at p. 310, Lord Denning M.R. stressed the
    importance of the appearance of judicial impartiality. He said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]n considering whether there was a real likelihood of bias,
    the court does not look at the mind of the justice himself.... It does not look
    to see if there was a real likelihood that he would, or did, in fact favour one
    side at the expense of the other. The court looks at the impression which would
    be given to other people. Even if he was as impartial as could be,
    nevertheless, if right-minded persons would think that, in the circumstances,
    there was a real likelihood of bias on his part, then he should not sit. And if
    he does sit, his decision cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    passage was cited with approval by Major J. in his dissenting reasons in <em>S.
    (R. D.)</em>, at para. 11, and by this court in <em>Benedict v. Ontario</em> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 147.  In <em>Benedict</em>, this court added, at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>We note that while Lord Denning M.R. spoke in terms of a “real
    likelihood” rather than a “reasonable apprehension”, in <em>National Energy
    Board</em> de Grandpré J. took care to state that such variations in the
    expression used should not generally be treated as involving any substantive
    difference in the approach to be taken.  “Reasonable apprehension”, “real
    likelihood”, “reasonable likelihood” and “reasonable suspicion” amount to the
    same standard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    reasoning accords with the decision of Lord Nolan in <em>R. v. Bow Street
    Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate et al.</em>, [1999] 1 All E.R. 577 (H.L.),
    at p. 592: “[I]n any case where the impartiality of a judge is in question the
    appearance of the matter is just as important as the reality.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appearance of impartiality was emphasized in <em>Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada</em>,
    [2003] 2 S.C.R. 259, at para. 66:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[W]here disqualification is argued, the relevant inquiry is not
    whether there was <em>in fact</em> either conscious or unconscious bias on the
    part of the judge, but whether a reasonable person properly informed would
    apprehend that there was.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    review of this court’s recent statements in<i> <em>Chippewas of Mnjikaning
    First Nation v. Ontario</em></i>, 2010 ONCA 47, 265 O.A.C. 247, leave to appeal
    to S.C.C. refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 91, at paras. 229-30, and <em>Marchand
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Public General Hospital Society of Chatham</em> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 97, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No.
    66, at para. 131, reveals the following principles for assessing a claim of
    reasonable apprehension of bias that are particularly applicable in this case:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“Impartiality reflects the state of mind in which the judge is
    disinterested in the outcome and is open to persuasion by the evidence and
    submissions. In contrast, bias reflects a state of mind that is closed or
    predisposed to a particular result on material issues”: <em>Marchand</em>, at
    para. 131.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The threshold for a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias is
    high. “Courts presume that judges will carry out their oath of office”: <em>Marchand</em>,
    at para. 131.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To determine that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists
    requires “a fact-specific inquiry” that considers “the facts and circumstances
    of a particular trial”: <em>Chippewas</em>, at para. 230.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“The party alleging reasonable apprehension of bias has the onus
    of proving it on the balance of probabilities”: <em>Marchand</em>, at para.
    131. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The grounds for finding a reasonable apprehension of bias must be
    substantial; establishing an allegation of judicial bias requires “cogent
    evidence”: <em>Marchand</em>, at para. 131. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    a judge’s words or conduct give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, it
    colours the entire trial. Therefore, on appeal, “a finding of actual or
    apprehended bias will ordinarily result in a new trial”: <em>Marchand</em>, at
    para. 131.</p>

    my view, an informed person, viewing the trial judge’s conduct realistically

    and Comments During Faraci’s Cross-Examination</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 21, 2012, soon after Faraci’s cross-examination began, the trial judge
    interjected and made comments to the effect that Faraci’s evidence “defie[d]
    common sense” and was “gobbledygook”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first interjection occurred after Faraci acknowledged that he had paid higher
    than market rent for the office space he occupied at Hazelton Lanes to create
    artificial income for Hazelton. Faraci maintained that this arrangement was not
    illegal so long as it was disclosed to prospective lenders or purchasers. According
    to him, “the key” was how “the document was used” and whether it was disclosed
    to third parties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response to this evidence, the trial judge challenged Faraci’s explanation: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>THE COURT: </span><em>Mr. Faraci,
    your explanation, with respect, defies common sense</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>. Now, I want to give you a chance to re-think it.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>What would be the point of setting
    up, what I think is a scheme, if it weren’t to deceive somebody with the
    information that appears in financial records or statements and things like
    that. </span><em>There would be no point, would there, in setting up this kind
    of scheme and then going and telling the lender or the purchaser what the true

  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>So you knew, I’m sure – I shouldn’t
    put it that strongly – </span><em>I put it to you that you must have known that
    Mr. Chan was going to use this for an improper purpose</em><span

  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>THE WITNESS: I knew I was paying a

  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>THE COURT: </span><em>Come on, Mr.
    Faraci, think about it carefully</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>. This wasn’t done
    for some business reason or tax reason or some other </span><em>bon[a] fide</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> reason. This was done to set the table so that Mr. Chan </span><em>could

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    this exchange, the trial judge put it to Faraci that the whole purpose of the
    inflated rental scheme would fail if Chan disclosed it to lenders or
    purchasers. Faraci agreed. The trial judge then suggested there was no reason
    for Faraci to engage in the scheme unless he was “prepared to close [his] eyes”
    to what Chan was doing. In response, Faraci maintained that his role was to
    tell Chan whether a particular tenant was a strong tenant or a weak tenant. The
    trial judge described explanation as “gobbledygook”, “not making sense”, and
    “not addressing the point”. Excerpts of these portions of Faraci’s
    cross-examination are included in Appendix “B” to these reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considered
    in isolation, these comments could be viewed as reflecting nothing more than a trial
    judge’s exasperation with a difficult witness. However, considered in the context
    of the trial judge’s other conduct that suggests that he prejudged Faraci’s conduct
    and credibility, they form part of a pattern that gives rise to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias.</p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Suggestion that Plaintiffs’ Counsel Bring a <i>Mareva</i> Injunction
    Motion </h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have reviewed the genesis of the <em>Mareva</em> injunction motion above. I
    note simply that, whenever granted, a <em>Mareva</em> injunction is an
    extraordinary remedy. It provides a moving party with broad relief before the
    issues in the case are determined. The granting of such relief is exceptional.
    Granting such relief mid-trial is even more exceptional. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge suggested that a mid-trial <em>Mareva</em> injunction motion would
    be appropriate. The suggestion that the respondents might reasonably bring a mid-trial
    motion for such extraordinary relief creates an appearance that the trial judge
    had prejudged Faraci’s conduct and that he was aligning himself the respondents.
    This conduct by the trial judge contributes to the appearance of a reasonable
    apprehension of bias. Further, as I will explain, this appearance of bias is
    confirmed by the trial judge’s reasons for granting the <em>Mareva</em> injunction
    he had suggested.</p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Trial Judge’s Mid-Trial Findings Concerning Faraci’s Conduct and Credibility</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons for granting the <em>Mareva</em> injunction, excerpts of which are
    set out below, the trial judge found that Faraci had engaged in a fraudulent scheme
    to divest himself of assets. As the trial judge himself later noted in his
    reasons for denying the recusal/mistrial motion (which were delivered after the
    appellants filed their notice of appeal of the contempt motion), he should have
    done no more in his reasons on the Mareva injunction motion than state that the
    evidence gave rise to a <i>prima facie</i> case. By going further and making
    findings, the trial judge effectively prejudged at least some of the issues on
    the added claims and commented adversely on Faraci’s honesty and credibility:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>During his cross-examination … [Faraci] described how he has,
    since about 2001, <em>systematically divested himself of his assets and has
    become judgment proof. His scheme for achieving this objective was carried out
    in concert with the new defendants with whom he engaged in numerous non-arm’s
    length transactions and to whom he effectively transferred large sums of money.…
    As part of their role in Faraci’s fraudulent scheme</em>, the new defendants
    provided Faraci with cash from time to time for his personal day to day needs
    as he request[ed] it. <em>I am persuaded that those payments were really a
    return to Faraci of his own money by those to whom he transferred it to hold
    for him in order to conceal the extent and whereabouts of his own wealth</em>….</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Accordingly, I have concluded that I must take what may be seen
    as a very unusual, perhaps unprecedented, step in the interests of justice by
    granting the order that is described below. <em>Otherwise, Faraci will likely
    continue to abuse the civil justice system by engaging it without any financial
    risk</em><i>.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s subsequent statements, in an endorsement dated September 16, 2013,
    concerning whether the <em>Mareva</em> injunction should continue as against
    the added defendant Susete Antunes only add to the perception that the trial
    judge had drawn adverse conclusions about Faraci’s conduct and credibility:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The evidence of Antunes and Faraci, viewed separately and
    together, <em>has no air of reality</em> and, when compared, are in conflict on
    many important factual issues. <em>Both Antunes and Faraci will have to deal
    with serious issues relating to credibility if this action is ultimately tried.
    As well, all of their evidence must be viewed in light of Faraci’s earlier
    admission, made without any reasonable explanation, that he has already
    dissipated all of his assets and survives only with the generosity of persons
    such as Antunes</em> who are willing to provide him with money from time to
    time when he requests it. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken
    together, these comments add to the perception of a reasonable apprehension of
    bias. In my view, a reasonable person would inevitably conclude that the trial
    judge granted and continued the injunction because he had prejudged the conduct
    and credibility of Faraci and those associated with him.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The 19 Mid-Trial
    Directions for Production of Documents</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> According
    to respondents’ counsel, his cross-examination of Faraci was longer than it
    should have been for two reasons, both of them Faraci’s fault. First, Faraci
    was evasive, unresponsive and generally uncooperative in his cross-examination.
    Second, respondents’ counsel was required to address with Faraci in his
    cross-examination various extraneous issues that Faraci attempted to add to the <em>lis </em>between the parties in the action. To deal with these issues,
    respondents’ counsel was required to obtain production of related documents.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    acknowledging that most, if not all, of the productions sought were for the
    purpose of challenging Faraci’s credibility, respondent’s counsel submits that
    a review of Faraci’s cross-examination demonstrates that the 19 directions for
    mid-trial productions were appropriate and necessary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that a review of Faraci’s cross-examination reveals that he was an
    evasive, unresponsive and generally uncooperative witness. Otherwise, I reject
    respondents’ counsel’s submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my review of the transcript, respondents’ counsel launched into many areas of
    cross-examination that were extraneous to the issues at trial. Moreover, in
    many, if not most instances, the documents he requested were of little, no or
    unknown relevance to the issues at the trial. Where the requested documents may
    have been of some relevance – generally to Faraci’s credibility – much more
    modest directions for production would have sufficed. If such documents were
    not produced, then it would have been open to the trial judge to draw an
    adverse inference from their non-production. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead
    of taking a realistic and proportionate approach to production (or curtailing the
    various lines of cross-examination), the trial judge directed and oversaw production
    of masses of documents mid-trial, without analyzing the potential relevance or
    probative value of the documents at issue and without considering the impact of
    his directions on trial efficiency and fairness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Considered globally, in my opinion, the number, breadth and
    fundamental lack of relevance of the documents that were the subject of the 19
    directions for production create an appearance that the trial judge was
    disdainful of Faraci and 170 and that he was prepared to accede unquestioningly
    to respondents’ counsel’s production requests. In effect, the trial judge
    aligned himself with the respondents on the production issue and lost all sense
    of what was proportionate and necessary to preserve trial fairness and
    efficiency. <span class=MsoPageNumber>Two examples will suffice to illustrate these
    points.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=MsoPageNumber>The first example begins with respondents’ counsel’s cross-examination
    of Faraci about </span>Faraci’s understanding of 170’s obligation to pay rent
    to Hazelton.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Faraci claimed that 170 was not obliged to pay rent if it did
    not receive funds from Chan or his companies<span class=MsoPageNumber>. Respondents’
    counsel pointed out that</span><span class=Heading1Char> </span><span
class=MsoPageNumber>rent had been paid in response to notices of default issued
    by Hazelton</span><span class=Heading1Char> </span><span class=MsoPageNumber>on
    two occasions in 2011, albeit under protest, which was after Faraci claimed that
    Chan and his companies had stopped sending rent monies. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>As part of the flow of this
    cross-examination, Faraci revealed that the funds to pay the rent had been
    supplied by others. On receiving this information, respondents’ counsel began
    questioning Faraci about how he had arranged his affairs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>This in turn, led to questions about
    Faraci’s ability to pay the amount demanded for rent immediately prior to
    Hazelton re-entering 170’s premises and terminating its tenancy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>As a result of this questioning,
    respondents’ counsel requested, and the trial judge directed that Faraci
    produce, numerous documents relating to his personal financial affairs. For
    example, Faraci was directed to:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>contact his former counsel and obtain details of all judgments
    filed against him of which his former counsel is aware;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>produce all bank documents pertaining to his personal and
    corporate bank accounts, from the beginning of 1998 to the date of trial; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>produce copies of all statements, invoices, bills, and all
    other documents pertaining to payments received and expenses incurred by Faraci
    in his provision of legal services to clients in 2010 and 2011.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave these directions before Chan and Hazelton had amended their
    pleadings to allege fraud and conspiracy. <span class=MsoPageNumber>In the
    circumstances, the documents had no apparent relevance to the issues then pleaded.
    In effect, the trial judge permitted </span>respondents’ counsel to turn
    Faraci’s cross-examination into a judgment-debtor examination. As I have said,
    by doing so, the trial judge appears to have aligned himself with the
    respondents, which contributed to the appearance of a reasonable apprehension
    of bias.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second example involves the trial judge’s direction to Faraci to produce all
    documentation relating to his trust accounts, including bank account
    statements, ledgers, and reconciliations, from 1998 to the date of trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The request for the direction arose initially out of Faraci’s
    evidence that he may have deposited a cheque he received in June 2006 for
    $376,686.45 in relation to his 3% interest in Hazelton Lanes into his trust
    account.<span class=Heading1Char> </span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Respondents’
    counsel wanted an explanation of how Faraci disbursed those funds. The
    requested direction expanded further so that respondents’ counsel could explore
    the flow of funds into and out of Faraci’s trust account relating to Chan’s
    claim for the return of $20,000 paid to Faraci in 1998 for a deposit on a real
    estate transaction. The direction was further expanded so that respondents’
    counsel could verify whether Faraci had received any funds from Chan to pay as
    inducements to other tenants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The problem with <span class=MsoPageNumber>respondents’ counsel’s
    requests is twofold. First, the documents had not been requested in advance of
    trial as part of the normal process of production and discovery. Second, with
    limited exceptions, the requested documents could not assist in resolving the
    issues at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=MsoPageNumber>What Faraci did with the </span>$376,686.45 he received in
    2006 was irrelevant to the issues at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the $20,000 advanced by one of Chan’s companies to serve as a deposit,
    Faraci acknowledged receiving the funds but claimed that Chan had authorized
    him to apply them to his legal fees. It was up to Faraci to show when and based
    on what authorization the funds were disbursed from his trust account. How a
    broad review of the flow of funds into and out of his trust account might
    assist the respondent is not apparent. A direction requiring Faraci to produce
    the trust ledger and any related documents demonstrating when the trust funds
    were disbursed and how this was authorized would have been sufficient. Had
    Faraci failed to produce documents relevant to proving his case, it was open to
    the trial judge to draw an adverse inference.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the possibility that Faraci had received funds from Chan, deposited them into
    his trust account and then paid them out as tenant inducements, it was Faraci
    who was claiming that Chan had paid tenant inducements. Accordingly, it was up
    to Faraci to prove it. Moreover, other than perhaps in relation to one
    transaction, Faraci did not assert that Chan had given him money for tenant
    inducements that he deposited into trust and then paid out. It was therefore
    unnecessary for <span class=MsoPageNumber>respondents’ counsel </span>to
    disprove such an allegation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the breadth and scope of this direction, it is apparent that it required
    production of a significant number of documents. The trial judge himself
    acknowledged that the documents he was directing Faraci to produce were of
    uncertain relevance. As he stated in making this direction, “I want Mr. Faraci
    to come with [a] large box of trust related records tomorrow … [a]nd we’ll see
    … if they are admissible, relevant and all that.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the trial judge would make a direction involving such extensive
    production with no apparent purpose related to resolving the issues at trial
    contributes to the appearance that he had aligned himself with the respondents,
    and to the creation of a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The Trial Judge’s
    Contempt Ruling</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his September 16, 2013 endorsement finding the appellant in contempt, the trial
    judge noted factors indicating that 170 and Faraci were fully aware of the
    trial judge’s directions for production and what they required. He gave the
    following additional reasons for his finding of contempt:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the Faraci
    defendants have wilfully engaged in ongoing efforts throughout this trial to
    delay it and impede the efforts of the plaintiffs to bring this action to the
    moment of judgment. The failure of Faraci to comply with my orders has been
    part of that strategy. He has partially complied, in drips and drabs, only when
    pressured by my orders and the prospect of being found in contempt and
    punished. He has rarely done what he has been ordered to do within the time
    limits prescribed. To the extent that he has complied, he has routinely done so
    in a way that makes it difficult to examine the fruits of his efforts.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>When Faraci was cross-examined by [counsel for Hazelton and
    Chan], he was questioned on issues related to the extent of Faraci’s compliance
    with my orders. Many of those questions were met with Faraci’s refusal to
    answer on the advice of his present counsel…. That advice, and Faraci’s
    refusals as disclosed in the transcript of evidence, were not only wrong but
    unreasonable. In these circumstances, I draw an inference adverse to the Faraci
    defendants. This conduct supports my findings that the conduct on the part of
    Faraci that constitute contempt was wilful and deliberate. There is no other
    reasonable inference that can be made.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Faraci’s conduct throughout this trial has been consistent with
    his strategy to obstruct and delay this trial.…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Faraci’s strategy must not be allowed to succeed. His ongoing
    efforts to hijack this trial are an affront to the administration of justice.
    Unless I interfere, they will also threaten the plaintiffs’ right to a fair
    trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the contempt finding, the trial judge stated that, even if he had
    not found Faraci and 170 in contempt, he would have made an order for security
    for costs under rule 60.12(c) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, which permits a court to make “such other order as is just”,
    where a party has failed to comply with an interlocutory order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difficulty with the trial judge’s contempt finding (and his alternative
    security for costs order) is that he conducted no analysis of the extent to
    which Faraci and 170 had complied with his directions or of the extent to which
    any non-compliance was due to factors beyond Faraci’s and 170’s control. The
    trial judge did not advert to Faraci’s affidavits in which he provided
    particulars of what had, and had not been, produced and the reasons for any
    non-production. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said,
    my review of the trial judge’s mid-trial directions leads me to conclude that
    their breadth, scope and lack of relevance to the issues at trial contributes
    to a reasonable apprehension of bias. His willingness to invoke the
    quasi-criminal remedy of contempt in relation to those directions only adds to
    that appearance.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the
    circumstances of this case, the trial judge’s failure to consider Faraci’s
    evidence and his failure to conduct a direction by direction analysis of
    compliance suggests more than mere inadvertence or misapprehension. Rather, his
    treatment of the issue demonstrates he had become aligned with the respondent. </p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conclusion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons
    I have explained, I conclude that the cumulative effect of the trial judge’s
    conduct gave rise to the appearance of a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of their
    submissions, the respondents argued that, in the absence of a complete trial
    record, such a finding should not be made. They rely on the fact the appellants
    did not file a full trial transcript with the court; rather, all the appellants
    filed was a copy of Faraci’s cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    particular circumstances of this case, I would not accept this submission. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge
    that an appeal court will generally look to the trial record “in its entirety”
    to determine whether a claim for reasonable apprehension of bias has been made
    out: <em>Chippewas</em>, at para. 230. In general, it is necessary to consider
    the complete record to determine whether the trial judge deprived a party of
    the ability to advance its case, or treated the parties in such an uneven
    manner that trial fairness was compromised. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case,
    however, no complete trial record exists; the trial was not completed. Rather,
    the appellants’ pleadings were struck and the respondents moved successfully
    for default judgment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents
    claim that the trial judge’s ruling that pre-2006 issues were relevant and Faraci’s
    evidence-in-chief somehow justified respondents’ counsel’s demands and the
    trial judge’s actions during Faraci’s cross-examination. They say this court is
    unable to assess the claim of reasonable apprehension of bias because we do not
    have the full record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not
    accept this submission. As I have said already, respondents’ counsel also
    claimed that a review of Faraci’s cross-examination would demonstrate why the
    19 mid-trial directions were necessary and appropriate. I rejected that
    submission. The respondents have not identified specific aspects of the balance
    of the trial that would justify the trial judge’s actions or detract from the
    appellants’ claim of a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the facts
    and circumstances of this particular trial, I am satisfied that the record
    before us provides an adequate basis to assess the trial judge’s conduct of the
    trial.</p>
  <h1>F.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disposition</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the
    foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments and orders
    under appeal and order a new trial before a different trial judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I would
    order a new trial, I have also accepted the respondents’ submission that the
    personal appellant was a difficult and uncooperative witness. In my view, it is
    apparent, from a review of the record, that all parties contributed to the
    trial spiralling out of control. In the circumstances, I would make no order as
    to the costs of the trial below.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the same
    reason, I would make no order as to the costs of the appeal. </p>

    Court</span>: So if doing it the honest way would result in the failure of
    these schemes, why do them at all unless you were prepared to close your eyes
    and pretend – sort of not look at what Mr. Chan –</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Witness</span>: No, no. That’s not true at all, Your Honour. My role was to get
    the tenant who he was satisfied with. I bring the tenant in. A document is
    signed, whether it’s a lease or otherwise, an offer to lease, okay? At that
    time, when the transaction is done – the time that the transaction is done,
    there are certain numbers. I advised them – for example, with the art gallery,
    I told him right at the beginning, I said, he’s very, very weak. I don’t know
    if he’ll last. And he said, fine, I’ll take care of it, if I have to.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>I did not see any exchange of cheques
    on rent between the art gallery and Mr. Chan. My role was, when the agreement
    was signed, I had to tell him whether he was a strong tenant, weak tenant. I
    did not collect any cheques, I did not issue any cheques, I did not deliver any
    cheques, save and except on the gym. That’s the one he gave me the funds after
    the agreement was signed and I gave it to the gym and they gave it – handed it
    back to him.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>So the so-called arrears – I guess if
    I can give an explanation is this –</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Court</span>:  Mr. Faraci, I can let you go on, but I tell you this
    respectfully, this is gobbledygook. You’re not making sense and you’re not
    addressing the point that I’m raising with you. If you want time to address the
    issue that I’m raising with you, give you all the time you need, but I don’t
    want you to go on now with other stuff.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Witness</span>:  Fair enough.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Court</span>:  Do you have anything more to say in response to the point that I
    raised with you, that is, if Mr. Chan were to act honestly and make full
    disclosure, that would defeat the whole purpose of this. I think you agreed
    that it would.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Witness</span>:  Yes.  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Court</span>:  So then why bother doing it? </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Witness</span>:  He did it. It was done.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Court</span>:  Okay, that’s enough….</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Court</span>:  Continue.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>[Respondents’
    Counsel]</span>: Yes. Unfortunately … We were not able to hear the last answer
    that Mr. Faraci gave to you – to Your Honour.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Court</span>: I don’t think it was responsive or of any probative value in any
    way.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Respondents’
    Counsel</span>: Thank you, Your Honour.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The

    to draw from it.</span></p>
