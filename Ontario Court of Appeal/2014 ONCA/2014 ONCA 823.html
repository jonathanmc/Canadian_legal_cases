<p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the acquittal entered on August 29, 2013

of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>

<p class=Endorsment align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Sharpe J.A.:</b></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is a Crown appeal from an acquittal following a judge alone trial
on charges of accessing and possession of child pornography.  The appeal raises
issues as to the meaning of control and wilful blindness in relation to the
offence of possession of child pornography. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent and his partner, M.R., shared a basement apartment.  M.R.
downloaded child pornography on a computer owned by the respondent and used by
both men.  The respondent had no interest in child pornography and did not
access the material M.R. had downloaded.  His partner accepted responsibility,
admitted that he had downloaded the prohibited material, pleaded guilty and was
sentenced for both possession of and accessing child pornography. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge found that the respondent was at least suspicious that
M.R. had downloaded the prohibited material on the computer.  The trial judge
also found that the respondent condoned the use [M.R.] made of the computer and
that included accessing child pornography, an activity to which the [respondent]
was wilfully blind.  The trial judge recognized that a finding that the
respondent had control and knowledge on the basis of wilful blindness would
ordinarily result in conviction.  However, he remained troubled and acquitted
the respondent on the basis of the doctrine of innocent possession.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Crown appeals the acquittal and asks this court to substitute a
conviction on the basis of the facts as found by the trial judge. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the following reasons, I conclude that the trial judge committed
legal errors in his reasoning with respect to both wilful blindness and the
doctrine of innocent possession.  However, despite those errors, he reached the
legally correct result.  He was rightly troubled by the prospect of convicting
the respondent and I would dismiss the Crowns appeal. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering><strong>FACTS</strong></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent and M.R. lived together in a room in the home of the
respondents parents.  The respondent owned a desktop computer that both men
used.  M.R. owned a laptop computer that he used exclusively.  Both men worked,
but on different schedules. M.R. was often alone in the couples room.  He made
extensive use of the respondents computer.  </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>M.R. had a diaper fetish which involved role-playing.  The respondent
participated a few times, but then refused to continue to do so. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent admitted that on two occasions he saw M.R. looking at
images of teenaged boys dressed in underwear on the desktop computer. It is
common ground that these images were not child pornography.  He also stated
that sometimes when he returned to the room from work, M.R. would immediately
change the programme or minimize what was on the computer screen.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Acting on a warrant, the police seized both computers and charged both
men with accessing and possession of child pornography. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
found a large number of images and videos depicting child pornography on the
desktop computer.  The files were stored in subfolders that were not readily
apparent or easily accessible, and there was evidence that the respondent was
not particularly computer literate.  The Crown relied upon statements made by
the respondent at the time of the seizure and after his arrest.  He told the
police that he knew, or at least had a good idea, that there might be child
pornography on his computer, but that he had not downloaded or accessed it and
had no interest in it. In a video statement, the respondent stated that he knew
M.R. accessed child pornography in relation to his diaper fetish, that he had
seen M.R. looking at images of teen males dressed in underwear on the desktop
computer, and that he had, in the words of the trial judge, then put two and
two together.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering><strong>REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</strong></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
trial judge made the following findings of fact:</p>

<p class=MsoListBullet>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Child pornography found on the desktop computer was accessed by M.R.</p>

<p class=MsoListBullet>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The desktop computer was the property of the respondent.</p>

<p class=MsoListBullet>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both the respondent and M.R. had free and unfettered access to the
desktop computer.</p>

<p class=MsoListBullet>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent had no interest in child pornography. He neither
downloaded nor accessed any of the child pornography found on the computer.</p>

<p class=MsoListBullet>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent was at least suspicious that child pornography had been
downloaded on his computer by M.R. but condoned it because M.R. was his partner
for whom he cared.</p>

<p class=MsoListBullet>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent took no steps to confirm his suspicion or to delete all
child pornographic images to prevent further access.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
trial judge cited <em>R. v. Morelli</em>, <span lang=EN-US>2010 SCC 8,</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span>[2010] 1 S.C.R. 253 for the proposition that both knowledge
and control are essential elements to a finding of possession under s. 4(3) of
the <em>Criminal Code</em>,<em> </em>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
found that the respondent had control of the desktop computer.  It was his
property and he could have attached any conditions to its use had he been so
inclined.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
respect to the statements made by the respondent at his home and at the police station
on the day of his arrest, the trial judge noted the respondents explanation
that the fact of his arrest had focused his mind on the nature of the charges
and that it was only after his arrest that he concluded that his suspicions
were probably well-founded.  The trial judge found that this explanation raised
a doubt on the issue of the respondents actual knowledge at the relevant time,
a doubt that he resolved in favour of the respondent. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
the trial judge also found that the respondent was at least suspicious that M.R.
had accessed and perhaps downloaded child pornography.  The trial judge referred
to the Supreme Courts definition of wilful blindness in <em>Sansregret v. The
Queen</em>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570 at p. 584.  The trial judge concluded that the
respondent had been wilfully blind as to the presence of child pornography on
his computer:</p>

<p class=CQuote>On these facts, I find that but for his relationship with his
partner, the [respondent] would and should have taken steps to make inquiries
of [M.R.] whether he had downloaded, or at least accessed, child pornography
and if so, to forthwith delete all such images and to cease and desist in such
activity in the future in the use by him of the computer of the [respondent].</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
finding both control and wilful blindness, the trial judge remained troubled
and went on to acquit the respondent on the basis of the doctrine of innocent
possession:</p>

<p class=CQuote>Taking the Crowns case at its highest, the [respondent]
condoned the use [M.R.] made of the computer and that included accessing child
pornography, an activity to which the [respondent] was wilfully blind.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
trial judge cited the decision of this court in <em>R. v. Chalk</em>, 2007 ONCA
815, <span lang=EN-US>88 O.R. (3d) 448, where Doherty J.A. confirmed the
existence of the innocent possession doctrine but held that it was not
available on the facts of that case.</span>  The trial judge held that <em>Chalk
</em>was distinguishable on its facts and concluded that the innocent
possession doctrine could and should be enlarged to apply to the respondents
conduct.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:avoid'><strong>ISSUES</strong></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[18]<span

<em>R. v. Briscoe</em>, <span lang=EN-US>2010 SCC 13,</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>[2010]
1 S.C.R. 411, the Supreme Court explained, at para. 21, that <span lang=EN>wilful
blindness imputes knowledge to an accused whose suspicion is aroused to the
point where he or she sees the need for further inquiries, but </span><em>deliberately
chooses</em><span lang=EN> not to make those inquiries (emphasis in original). 
Writing for the court, Charron J. adopted Sopinka J.s statement in </span><em>R.
v. Jorgensen</em><span lang=EN>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 55, at para. 103: A finding
of wilful blindness involves an affirmative answer to the question: Did the
accused shut his eyes because he knew or strongly suspected that looking would
fix him with knowledge? </span><em>Briscoe</em><span lang=EN> emphasizes the
need to keep the concepts of wilful blindness and recklessness distinct.&nbsp;
As explained in </span><em>Sansregret</em><span lang=EN>, at p. 584: </span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[W]hile recklessness involves knowledge of a
danger or risk and persistence in a course of conduct which creates a risk that
the prohibited result will occur, wilful blindness arises where a person who
has become aware of the need for some inquiry declines to make the inquiry</span><em><span
lang=EN> </span>because he does not wish to know the truth.&nbsp; He would
prefer to remain ignorant.</em> <span lang=EN>The culpability in recklessness
is justified by consciousness of the risk and by proceeding in the face of it,
while in wilful blindness it is justified by the accuseds fault in </span><em>deliberately
failing to inquire</em><span lang=EN> when he knows there is reason for
inquiry.&nbsp; [Emphasis added in </span><em>Briscoe</em><span lang=EN>.]&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font-style:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></em><span lang=EN>Charron J. also cited with approval the
discussion of wilful blindness by two eminent criminal law scholars. Professor
Glanville Williams, in </span><em>Criminal Law: The General Part</em><span
lang=EN>, 2nd ed. (London: Stevens &amp; Sons,1961), at p. 159, explained the
very limited scope of wilful blindness in the following way:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>A court can properly find wilful blindness only
where it can almost be said that the defendant actually knew.&nbsp; He
suspected the fact; he realised its probability; but </span><em>he refrained
from obtaining the final confirmation because he wanted in the event to be able
to deny knowledge.&nbsp; This, and this alone, is wilful blindness.&nbsp; It
requires in effect a finding that the defendant intended to cheat the
administration of justice.</em><span lang=EN>&nbsp; Any wider definition would
make the doctrine of wilful blindness indistinguishable from the civil doctrine
of negligence in not obtaining knowledge.&nbsp; [Emphasis added in </span><em>Briscoe</em><span
lang=EN>.]</span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN>[24]<span

lang=EN>Referring to&nbsp;Professor Don Stuarts </span><em>Canadian Criminal
Law: A Treatise</em><span lang=EN>,</span><span lang=EN> 5th&nbsp;ed. (Toronto:
Carswell, 2007), at p. 241, Charron J. agreed, at para. 24, that deliberate
ignorance seems more descriptive than wilful blindness, as it connotes an
actual process of suppressing a suspicion.&nbsp; Charron J. added that
[w]hile a failure to inquire may be evidence of recklessness or criminal
negligence wilful blindness is not simply a failure to inquire but, to repeat
Professor Stuarts words, deliberate ignorance. </span></p>

O.J. No. 5838, this court considered language in a jury instruction to the
effect that wilful blindness could be established on the basis of evidence that
the accused knew child pornography could be accessed through Limewire or had a
suspicion that it could be. The court held that this language was too broad
and failed to deal with the level of suspicion required to engage the doctrine
of wilful blindness.   </span></p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In my respectful view, the same error is revealed by the reasons of the
trial judge in the present case.  While he did cite </span><em>Sansregret</em><span
lang=EN>, he did not focus on the need to find that the respondent shut his
eyes because he knew or strongly suspected that looking would fix him with
knowledge or became aware of the need for some inquiry [yet] decline[d] to
make the inquiry</span><em><span lang=EN> </span></em><span lang=EN>because he [did]
not wish to know the truth.  The trial judge was only prepared to find that
the respondent was </span>at least suspicious that M.R. had accessed or
downloaded child pornography and that but for his relationship with M.R. he
would and should have made further inquiries.  In my view, while this might
support a finding of negligence or recklessness, it falls short of a situation
where it <span lang=EN>can almost be said that the defendant actually knew so
as to amount to wilful blindness. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>A second and related point is that in finding </span>wilful blindness
in relation to the charge of <em>possession</em> of child pornography, the
trial judge based his finding in part on imputed knowledge that M.R. <em>accessed</em>
child pornography<span lang=EN>.  These two crimes are distinct.  As held by
the majority in </span><em>Morelli</em>,<em> </em>at para. 31, evidence that a person
accessed child pornography on a computer does not establish the offence of possession
of child pornography.  There was no evidence that the non-pornographic images
of young males in underwear seen by the respondent were downloaded, and the
trial judge framed his finding on the respondents suspicion in terms of
whether [M.R.] had downloaded, or at least accessed, child pornography.  A
finding that the respondent was wilfully blind to the fact that M.R. had <em>accessed</em>
child pornography does not amount to a finding that the respondent was wilfully
blind to the fact that M.R. had <em>downloaded</em> child pornography.  On the
authority of <em>Morelli</em>, downloading is required to support a finding of
possession.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the

of child pornography.</p>

lang=EN>The innocent possession doctrine relied on by the trial judge is
derived from cases where an accused does exercise control over contraband, but
with the absence of an intention to exercise control beyond that needed to
destroy the contraband or otherwise put it permanently beyond ones control: </span><em>Chalk</em><span
lang=EN>, at para. </span>24, citing <em>R. v. Christie</em> (1978), 41 C.C.C.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>I agree with the submission of the Crown that the respondent cannot
claim the benefit of the innocent possession doctrine.  Innocent possession
applies where an accused has a valid explanation for any control exercised over
contraband.  The respondent did not take control of the contraband to destroy
it or to remove it from his computer. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The question here is whether the respondent had control over the
contraband in the first place.  Although the innocent possession doctrine does
not apply, the innocent possession cases are relevant to this issue as they elucidate
what is meant by control. </span><em>Chalk</em><span lang=EN>, at para. 23, includes
the following passage from </span><em>Christie</em><span lang=EN>, at p. 287:</span></p>

<p class=CQuote>In my opinion, there can be circumstances which do not
constitute possession even where there is a right of control with knowledge of
the presence and character of the thing alleged to be possessed, where guilt
should not be inferred, as where it appears there is no intent to exercise
control over it.</p>

<p class=CQuote>Personal possession is established where an accused person

inapt legal label or category, he did not err in finding that the Crown had

the trial judge put it, taking the Crowns case at its highest, through his
failure to act, the respondent condoned the use [M.R.] made of the computer

short of establishing a degree of control over the contraband sufficient to
ground criminal liability for possession. </p>

have child pornography downloaded on his computer.  He condoned M.R. having
free access to and use of his computer but he did not condone, agree or give

<em>Chalk</em>, the accused was arrested on an unrelated charge and called his
girlfriend to instruct her to delete files containing child pornography stored
on a shared computer.  The Crown relies on the italicized words in the
following passage from <em>Chalk</em>, at para. 26, where this court rejected
the application of the innocent possession doctrine:</p>

<p class=CQuote>On the trial judge's findings, the appellant did not have
possession of the child pornography strictly for the purposes of destroying
that pornography. He knew that the pornography was on the computer's hard drive
for several months. During that time, he regularly used the computer <em>and
had control over the pornography in the sense that he could have deleted it
from the computer at any time had he chosen to do so</em>. On his own admission,
he ultimately decided to delete the pornography because he feared that the
police would discover it when they examined his computer. In those
circumstances, the appellant's instruction to delete the material was a
manifestation of his longstanding power or authority over the material. That
control had existed for several months and was not merely incidental to an
innocent purpose. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am unable to accept the submission that the italicized words answer the issue
posed in this case.  As is clear from reading this passage as a whole, the
evidence that the accused in <em>Chalk</em> asked his girlfriend to delete the
contraband could not be viewed in isolation.  Rather than being evidence of an
innocent purpose, his instruction was a manifestation of his longstanding
power or authority over the material.  </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
my view, to accept the Crowns argument that the respondent had control over the
child pornography by virtue of his ownership, especially when combined with a
finding of imputed intention, would unduly stretch the limits of criminal
liability.  To convict the respondent of a serious criminal offence that
entails a minimum period of incarceration simply because he suspected his
partner might have been using his computer to access and perhaps download child
pornography would not correspond to his limited level of moral culpability. </p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
there are flaws in the trial judges legal analysis, his assessment of the case
was essentially sound.  He was rightly troubled by the prospect of convicting
the respondent of this offence, and the respondent was properly acquitted of
this charge.</p>

<p class=AParaNumbering style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
recognize, of course, that child pornography poses a serious problem for our
society and that criminal sanctions must be imposed against those who involve
themselves in this deeply destructive and harmful activity.  However, we must
not lose sight of the basic principles of criminal law, and we should preserve
the criminal sanction for conduct that is truly criminal.  In this case, M.R.
has been convicted and sentenced for the crime of possession of child
pornography. On the facts as found by the trial judge, the respondent was not
sufficiently aware of or involved in the commission of that crime to warrant
conviction.</p>
