  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Michael A. Penny of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 11, 2013, with reasons reported
    at 2013 ONSC 784, and a related costs order dated August 20, 2013.</p>
  <p class=Heading>R. A. Blair J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After nearly 20 years of marriage, Lisa and Brian Ludmer separated. There
    are two children of the marriage, both adults and at the time of trial, both
    attending university. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commendably, they agreed upon issues relating to custody and access, by
    way of a joint parenting plan. However, in all respects relating to the
    financial and property issues arising out of their separation they have engaged
    in scorched-earth litigation warfare. Each accuses the other of having “litigated
    with impunity”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By all accounts the Ludmers are able individuals. During their marriage,
    they enjoyed a relatively upper middle-class lifestyle in North Toronto. Mr.
    Ludmer worked hard as a corporate and securities lawyer, rising through the
    ranks to partner in three Toronto law firms. His practice declined, however,
    and at the end of 2004 he was let go. In 2005 he re-commenced practice as a
    sole practitioner, and since then has re-invented himself as a successful
    family law lawyer. Ms. Ludmer worked as a placement consultant and recruiter at
    various personnel placement firms and on her own with some interruption for her
    child-rearing responsibilities when the children were young. After the
    separation, she began, once again, to work outside the home.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify;page-break-after:
avoid'><span class=Underline><span style='font-weight:normal'>The </span></span><em><u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Family Law Act</span></u></em><span class=Underline><span
style='font-weight:normal'> and Support Claims (“The Ludmer action”)</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claims as between Mr. Ludmer and Ms. Ludmer revolved around the
    financial and property issues arising out of their marriage, including child
    and spousal support and the equalization of family property. There were many
    interlocutory and other proceedings prior to trial. One involved a dispute in
    the province of Québec over disclosure of information relating to a family
    trust established by Mr. Ludmer’s father of which Mr. Ludmer is a beneficiary. That
    dispute made its way through the Superior Court of Québec, the Court of Appeal
    of Québec, and an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
    Canada. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial of the Ludmer action finally took place over 13 days in
    October and November 2012, before Penny J. On February 11, 2013, he released a
    thorough and carefully reasoned 51-page decision. Mr. Ludmer was successful in
    some respects, Ms. Ludmer in others. On August 20, 2013, after hearing
    submissions, the trial judge ordered that each party should bear their own
    costs.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=Underline><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The Spira Action</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penny J. also dealt with a separate proceeding commenced by Mr. Ludmer
    against a former neighbour, Gary Spira. This proceeding (“the Spira action”)
    was initially a civil claim for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of
    mental distress, and for injunctive relief under s. 35 of the <em>Children’s
    Law Reform Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12, (“the CLRA”) essentially on the
    basis that Mr. Spira was an officious intermeddler in the dispute between the
    Ludmers. The claim for injunctive relief was not actively pursued after Mr. Spira
    ceased his interventions. These three claims were ultimately dismissed in the
    civil context. In 2008, the appellant added these claims to his family law
    proceedings and they were heard at the same time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The substantive complaints in the Spira action were two-fold: (i) that
    Mr. Spira had interfered in Mr. Ludmer’s relationship with his children and was
    blindly aligned with Ms. Ludmer in a campaign to do so; and (ii) that Mr. Spira
    had invaded Mr. Ludmer’s privacy by intercepting and reading his private, and
    in some cases privileged, electronic communications and forwarding them to Ms.
    Ludmer’s lawyers. The trial judge dismissed these claims and awarded costs of $125,000
    plus HST and disbursements of $5,223.01.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=Underline><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The Ludmer Action</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For purposes of the appeal the main financial and property issues
    resolved at trial were:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) the validity and enforceability of a marriage contract
    entered into by the Ludmers following their marriage;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) ownership of the matrimonial home;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) equalization of family property and excluded property in
    that context; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(d) four issues relating to support:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(i) determination of the parties’ income;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(ii) child support;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(iii) spousal support; and</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(iv) s. 7 expenses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Ludmer was successful in establishing that the marriage contract was
    valid and enforceable and, accordingly, that his interest in the family trust
    was not to be included in the equalization payment calculation. This was a
    significant outcome for him: we are advised that his contingent interest in the
    trust is approximately $6 to $8 million. An additional benefit of this finding
    was that Mr. Ludmer had a positive balance of approximately $270,000 by way of
    equalization. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, however, Mr. Ludmer was unsuccessful in his claim to an 80 per
    cent ownership interest in the matrimonial home – the trial judge found the
    couple owned it equally – and was required to pay Ms. Ludmer the sum of
    $244,500 with respect to the post-separation increase in its market value. He
    was successful in excluding certain loans made by his father from his income
    for support purposes, but was unsuccessful in sustaining his net income as
    claimed as a result of the trial judge’s decision not to accept his business
    deductions entirely for that purpose. He was required to pay arrears of child
    support and a lump sum payment to Ms. Ludmer in the amount of $432,000, on
    account of spousal support.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    all of the various claims were set off against each other, Mr. Ludmer was
    required to pay Ms. Ludmer a net amount of $194,434. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal concerns the issues on which Mr. Ludmer was unsuccessful and the
    findings made against him. On his behalf, Mr. Joseph raises many grounds of
    appeal. He argues that the trial judge erred:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> in calculating the parties’ income (by failing to accept Mr. Ludmer’s
    business expenses for the purposes of spousal support, and by failing to
    include the proceeds of both parties’ RRSPs in income for child support
    purposes);</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in determining spousal support on both a compensatory and needs basis; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in failing to adjust his lump sum spousal support award for tax
    consequences, present value discounting, and future contingencies;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in failing to deduct spousal support from his income for the purpose of
    allocating s. 7 expenses;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in allocating all of the 2005 s. 7 expenses to Mr. Ludmer;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>f)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in ordering the parties to bear their own costs; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>g)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in failing to determine previous motion costs that had been deferred to
    the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Ludmer concedes ground (d) above. Section 3.1 of Schedule III of the <em>Federal
    Child Support Guidelines</em>, SOR/97-175 (“the <em>Guidelines</em>”), provides
    that spousal support payable is to be deducted from the payor’s income for the
    purposes of the s. 7 calculation. The parties agree that this correction
    increases the amount that Ms. Ludmer owes to Mr. Ludmer for her contribution to
    s. 7 expenses by $38,096.36. This reduces the net amount owing by Mr. Ludmer to
    Ms. Ludmer from $194,434 to $156,337.64. The judgment below will be varied
    accordingly.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    otherwise reject the appellant’s grounds for appeal. For the most part they
    involve an attack on the trial judge’s findings of fact, all of which were
    amply supported on the record. It is well established that the standard of
    review in family law litigation promotes finality and recognizes the importance
    of the appreciation of the facts by the trial judge. An appeal court may
    intervene only when there is a material error, a serious misapprehension of the
    evidence, or an error in law.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify'><em><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Business Expenses Deductions</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ludmer led evidence from his accountant to establish that the business
    deductions claimed for his one-person law practice were proper for income tax purposes.
    No one contests that. The trial judge concluded – correctly – however, that “[t]he
    fact that a business expense is ‘legitimate’ for tax purposes does not mean
    that the same deduction is reasonable for support purposes”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Joseph accepts this general legal proposition, but argues that the trial judge
    erred in arbitrarily arriving at a 50 per cent threshold for business expenses
    in relation to gross income. I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ludmer argued at trial that his expenses were high because he was required to
    spend larger amounts on publications, technology, secretarial staff and
    paralegal staff, in order to promote himself and to build his new practice. The
    trial judge accepted this argument for the early years. He concluded, however,
    that “once [Mr. Ludmer’s] practice was up and running and generating
    substantial revenues starting in 2009, closer scrutiny [was] warranted”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the years 2009, 2010, and 2011, Mr. Ludmer claimed that his business expenses,
    as a percentage of gross professional income, were 66.18 per cent, 56.99 per
    cent, and 78.42 per cent, respectively. The trial judge determined that to
    allow the full amount of Mr. Ludmer’s claim for home office, legal, vehicle,
    meals, entertainment, and, particularly, a 10 per cent of gross revenue
    deduction for expenditures on publications to sustain a one-person operation,
    was unreasonable for support purposes. It was not a fair barometer – on a
    common sense basis – of “[the] income level that fairly and reasonably reflect[ed]
    the compensation available to [Mr. Ludmer] to pay support” (at para. 157). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Determining
    child and spousal support is not an exact science. The trial judge lived with
    this case through 13 days of trial. Indeed, he had had prior exposure to the
    litigation through various interlocutory proceedings. He was well aware of the
    dynamics of the litigation, the relationship between the Ludmers, and the
    particulars of their lifestyle. In the end, he concluded that “the fairest and
    simplest expedient in these circumstances [was] simply to find that [Mr.
    Ludmer’s] business expenses, for support purposes, cannot reasonably [exceed]
    50 per cent of gross revenue” (at para. 159). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this approach was open to the trial judge in the circumstances, and I see
    no basis for interfering with it.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify'><em><span
style='font-weight:normal'>RRSPs</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2007 and 2008 each party cashed in RRSPs – Ms. Ludmer in the total amount of
    $347,057, and Mr. Ludmer in the total amount of $181,964. Clearly, the
    inclusion of these amounts in income would have favoured Mr. Ludmer in the
    calculation of child support. The trial judge did not do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>This Court has held that RRSP income is “presumptively part
    of a spouse’s income for child support purposes.” That is because section s. 16
    of the <em>Guidelines</em> provides that a person’s annual income for child
    support purposes is determined using the sources of income set out under the
    heading “Total income” on the T1 tax form. RRSP income is included as part of “Total
    income” on the T1 tax form: see <em>Fraser v. Fraser</em>, 2013 ONCA 715, 40
    R.F.L. (7th) 311, at para. 97. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    inclusion of RRSP proceeds is not mandatory, however, and the court has the
    discretion in appropriate circumstances to do otherwise. Section 17(1) of the <em>Guidelines</em> provides this flexibility:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the court is of the opinion that the determination of a
    spouse’s annual income under section 16 <em>would not be the fairest
    determination</em> of that income, the court may have regard to the spouse’s
    income over the last three years and determine an amount that is <em>fair and
    reasonable in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income or receipt
    of a non-recurring amount</em> during those years. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge excluded both parties’ RRSP proceeds from the calculation of
    their income for support purposes on the basis that they were “non-repeating
    encroachments on capital”. Ms. Ludmer’s financial statement indicated that she
    used her proceeds primarily to finance this costly litigation, not to enhance
    her lifestyle. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not state specifically that he was applying the analysis under ss.
    16 and 17 of the <em>Guidelines</em> when arriving at this decision. However,
    his reasons show that he was alive to the need to arrive at income levels that
    “fairly reflected” the financial capacities of the spouses for the purpose of
    support. In short, his reasons show that, in his view, including the RRSP
    proceeds in the parties’ incomes “would not be the fairest determination of
    [the spouses’ incomes]” for support purposes, and that in excluding them, he
    was arriving at an amount that was “fair and reasonable in light of any pattern
    of income, fluctuation in income or receipt of a non-recurring amount”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span

    I see no error in the trial judge’s decision to award spousal support on both

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was open to the trial judge to find, as he did, that Ms. Ludmer “was
    financially disadvantaged, at a personal level, by the allocation of roles
    during the marriage,” that this affected her consulting business, and that she
    was “unlikely to be able to replicate on her own” the standard of living that
    the “complete merger of [their] economic lifestyles” had enabled the Ludmers to
    enjoy. This was sufficient, in my opinion, to justify a “compensatory claim”
    component in the spousal support award. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    generally – as he was required to do – the trial judge addressed the various
    factors relating to “the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of
    each spouse” in determining whether Ms. Ludmer was entitled to spousal support
    and, if so, the quantum to be awarded: <em>Divorce Act,</em> R.S.C. 1985, c. 3
    (2nd Supp.), s. 15.2(4). He summarized his conclusions, at para. 249 of his
    reasons, as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>With respect to the specific monthly amount of support, I have
    considered the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse,
    the Guideline amount, the result of the equalization calculation and the
    distribution of property between the spouses, the age and stage of the
    applicant, the ages and stages of the children, the work histories of the
    parties, the length of the marriage, the functions performed by each spouse
    during the marriage, the economic disadvantages to the applicant resulting from
    the marriage breakdown and the promotion of the applicant’s self-sufficiency.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record supports that he did just that.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify'><em><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Lump Sum Adjustment</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the request of Mr. Ludmer’s counsel, the trial judge made a lump sum award for
    spousal support. His lump sum award of $432,000 represented the total of the
    monthly and annual support amounts that he had found to be payable for the
    years 2008 through 2015 – the 8-year time-limited period for support that he
    had concluded was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ludmer objects because the trial judge did not adjust the $432,000 amount for
    tax consequences, present value considerations, and future contingencies. The
    trial judge recognized that there was support in the authorities for adjusting
    a lump sum representing future support payments for such factors. However, he
    concluded that in the circumstances of this case, such an adjustment was not
    needed. At para. 257 of his reasons he stated: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, I do not think any adjustment is necessary. The
    period in question is relatively short. The lump sum I have awarded was
    determined based on my discretion taking into account a wide range of factors,
    not least of which [were] the consequences for the applicant of equalization
    and property division in this case. Five of the eight years have already gone
    by. Had there been discounting on account of taxes, the amount of support
    awarded would have been proportionately higher.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion was reasonable in the circumstances, in my view.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify'><em><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Section 7 Expenses</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    varying annual amounts from 2005 to 2012, Mr. Ludmer paid a total of
    $606,577.12 for children’s expenses such as their Hebrew day school, a nanny,
    Kyle’s hockey, post-secondary school, and summer camp. It is not contested that
    these were appropriate special or extraordinary expenses under s. 7 of the <em>Guidelines</em> in accordance with the parties’ lifestyle prior to separation or that Ms.
    Ludmer paid nothing towards them and, indeed, acquiesced in them for the most
    part.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognizing
    that s. 7 expenses are generally to be shared by parents in proportion to their
    incomes, but that he had the discretion to decide otherwise, the trial judge
    arrived at a calculation that required Ms. Ludmer to pay Mr. Ludmer a total of
    $181,790. As noted above, Ms. Ludmer concedes that the trial judge erred in
    failing to take into account support payments ordered in calculating these
    payments and that the appropriate amount owing by her is $219,886.36.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not allocate any of the s. 7 expenses for the year 2005 –
    $84,751.97 – to Ms. Ludmer, however. Mr. Ludmer argues he erred in that
    respect.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ludmer had no income in 2005. He funded the s. 7 expenses through loans made to
    him by his father. For reasons that are not germane to the appeal, the trial
    judge concluded that the loans received would not form part of Mr. Ludmer’s
    income for support purposes. He took a different view of them for s. 7
    purposes, however, rejecting the argument that the principle “gifts are not
    income” was dispositive of the s. 7 issue as well.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the trial judge’s view, s. 7 expenses of almost $85,000 in a year when Mr.
    Ludmer had zero income (and Ms. Ludmer only $66,809) were simply not reasonable
    when “this couple could not possibly have afforded [them] on the basis of their
    own incomes”. The fact that the expenses were funded entirely through family
    assistance opened up the issue of apportionment and enabled the trial judge to
    look beyond the parties’ respective incomes. Requiring Ms. Ludmer to reimburse
    Mr. Ludmer for those payments, in the circumstances, was not appropriate.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it was open to the trial judge to come to this conclusion. In any
    event, the amount in issue would not be Ms. Ludmer’s share of $84,751.97. Because
    the expenses were funded through a loan, the amount in question would only be
    her share of the interest on the amount of the loan for that year. In the
    overall balancing of the financial issues between the parties, this would be a
    relatively insignificant amount.</p>

    “intrusion upon seclusion” – in <em>Jones v. Tsige</em>, 2012 ONCA 32, 346
    D.L.R. (4th) 34. Sharpe J.A. identified the elements of the cause of action at
    para. 71 of his reasons:<em> </em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The key features of this cause of action are, first, that the
    defendant’s conduct must be intentional, within which I would include reckless;
    second that the defendant must have invaded, without lawful justification, the
    plaintiff’s private affairs or concerns; and third, that a reasonable person
    would regard the invasion as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation or
    anguish. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this respect, he adopted, at para. 70 of his reasons, the essential elements of
    the action for intrusion upon seclusion from the <em>Restatement (Second) of
    Torts</em> § 652B (2010), which states: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon
    the seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to
    liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the invasion would be

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly identified the elements of the cause of action and he
    found as a fact (a) that Mr. Spira had neither “hacked into” nor had access to
    Mr. Ludmer’s email account; (b) that Mr. Spira had never, himself, intercepted
    any of Mr. Ludmer’s emails; and (c) that Mr. Spira had never read any of the
    emails. The trial judge concluded that the simple fact that Mr. Spira had
    forwarded certain of these emails to Ms. Ludmer’s lawyer at her request was not
    sufficient to ground a claim for invasion of privacy. He found that it was Ms.
    Ludmer, not Mr. Spira, who had intentionally intruded upon Mr. Ludmer’s private
    affairs, and that whatever assistance Mr. Spira provided was not for purpose of
    assisting in her intrusion upon those private affairs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    purposes of his costs analysis, the trial judge considered the major issues in
    the case to fall into two general categories: (i) claims involving the validity
    of the marriage contract and the family trust; and (ii) the income and support
    issues. He found Mr. Ludmer successful on the first of these and Ms. Ludmer, on

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ludmer argues, however, that he was successful on the “key” issues. By that he
    means the issues relating to the marriage contract, the family trust, and the
    exclusion of his beneficial interest in the trust from equalization of property
    and support calculations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span

    that the quantum awarded was disproportionate and unreasonable in relation to

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span

    to settle, Mr. Spira had done so as well, and Mr. Spira’s offer – which was not
    accepted – was more favourable than the result obtained by Mr. Ludmer in the
    third party action. Rather than finding Mr. Spira’s conduct inappropriate, as
    he had declined to do at trial as well, the trial judge found that the claim
    against Mr. Spira “was a form of intimidation and punishment for ‘siding’ with
    [Ms. Ludmer] in the dispute”, that the claims had “no hope of success”, and
    that they “were instituted for emotional and purely strategic purposes” and “to

    concluded that Mr. Spira was entitled to costs on a full indemnity basis. That

    submitted by Mr. Spira’s counsel. Mr. Spira’s counsel sought $300,000. The
