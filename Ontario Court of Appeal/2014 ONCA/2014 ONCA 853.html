  <p class=Judge><strong>Tulloch J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 12, 2012, the appellant was convicted
    in a trial by judge and jury of threatening death, unlawful confinement, sexual
    assault causing bodily harm, and assault with a weapon, contrary to ss.
    264.1(1)(a), 279(2), 272(1)(c) and 267 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46. He was acquitted of attempted choking with intent to enable
    himself to commit a sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault by wounding.
    He was sentenced to a global sentence of five years in custody, minus 19
    months credit for pre-sentence custody on a 1:1 basis. He appeals his
    conviction and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In these reasons, I begin by giving a brief
    outline of the factual background that gives rise to this appeal, after which,
    I will deal, in sequential order, with the main grounds of appeal raised by the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Facts and Evidence at Trial</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>All charges arose from an incident that occurred
    in the early hours of December 25, 2010. The complainant was an acquaintance of
    the appellant, and they had met a few times before the night in question. After
    midnight on December 25, 2010, the complainant and the appellant were at a
    night club where the complainant consumed three drinks and danced with the
    appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the end of the night when they decided to
    leave, the complainant accepted a cab ride offered to her by the appellant. The
    complainant testified that she had intended to sleep at her mothers apartment.
    A security camera shows that the complainant, the complainants friend and the
    appellant entered the lobby of her mothers apartment building and that the
    appellant and the complainant subsequently got back into the cab. The
    complainant and the appellant arrived at the appellants apartment shortly
    before 4:00 a.m. During the time when the complainant was at the appellants
    apartment, she sent and received a number of text messages and phone calls.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During this time, there was sexual activity
    between the appellant and the complainant. The complainant alleged that the
    appellant had non-consensual vaginal intercourse with her, cutting off her body
    suit to facilitate the act, which resulted in her finger being cut. According
    to the complainant, the sexual assault took place over several hours in several
    episodes beginning after 4:00 a.m., and continuing to sometime after 7:15 a.m. She
    alleged that he threatened her with a knife or scissors and held it to her
    throat, attempted to choke her, hit or punched her in the left eye, pinned her legs
    in a painful position and refused to let her leave. She testified that at one
    point when the appellant went to the bathroom, she kicked the knife to the
    floor from the bed. The complainant called 911 and the appellant was arrested. When
    the police attended at the appellants apartment, they located an open knife by
    the foot of the appellants bed on the floor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants version of events was very
    different. The appellant claims that the sexual activity was all consensual. According
    to the appellant, the sexual intercourse was consensual, as was the cutting off
    of the body suit. He claims that he accidentally cut the complainants finger
    in the process. He denies causing any intentional injury to the complainant
    whatsoever.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Evidence was presented at trial of cuts and
    scratches to the complainants neck, swelling around her eye, a laceration to
    her finger, and bruising on her legs. There was also evidence that the
    complainant suffered psychological harm as a result of the incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence alleged that the complainant was not
    credible, as she admitted in cross-examination that she had lied under oath in
    court in the past after accusing a man of sexually assaulting her and that she
    lies when it is in her interest to do so. The complainant testified that she
    had lied under oath because the man she had accused of sexual assault was the
    father of her daughter and he had threatened to take away her daughter and
    harass her family if she testified against him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two further pieces of evidence are relevant to
    this appeal. First, the complainant testified that, prior to the night in
    question, the appellant had sent her several text messages trying to convince
    her to go out with him. In one of those text messages, the complainant
    testified that the appellant said, I dont take no, which she interpreted as meaning
    that he would not take no for an answer. Second, the complainant testified that,
    while she was at the appellants residence on the night of the incident, he
    said to her, I kill people for fun, I kill people for money.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Charge to the Jury</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the three-week trial, the jury was charged
    on March 12, 2012. The trial judge provided the jury with general instructions
    on their duties as triers of fact, the presumption of innocence, reasonable
    doubt, and assessment of evidence. She outlined the Crowns theory of the case
    followed by the defences position. She provided a chronology of the facts
    which made reference to Crown and defence evidence. She then instructed the
    jury on the elements of each count.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge organized her charge on the
    counts in a somewhat unusual fashion. Rather than going through them
    sequentially, she began with the counts she considered unrelated  count two:
    uttering a death threat; count three: attempted choking; and count four:
    unlawful confinement  and then proceeded with the counts she considered
    related  count six: aggravated sexual assault; count five: sexual assault
    causing bodily harm; the lesser and included offence of sexual assault; and
    count one: assault with a weapon.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In respect of counts six and five (aggravated
    sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm), the trial judge
    instructed the jury that the defence of consent was not available for those
    counts if they were satisfied that the appellant both intended to cause and did
    cause bodily harm to the complainant. Rather, consent would only be a defence
    if the jury reached the lesser included offence of sexual assault:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The </span>defence of consent is not available
    to [the appellant] if you conclude that the Crown has proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt that [the appellant] both intended and caused the harm
    contemplated in either Count 6 or in Count 5.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The defence of consent is relevant to your considerations only
    with respect to the lesser included offence of sexual assault, if you conclude
    that the Crown has not proved the charges against [the appellant] in either Count
    6 or Count 5.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the count of sexual assault causing bodily
    harm, the jury was instructed that, in order to find the appellant guilty of
    sexual assault causing bodily harm, it had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

    that the trial judge did not sufficiently emphasize the element of consent in
    the charge to the jury on the count of sexual assault causing bodily harm. The
    trial judge did not list lack of consent as one of the required elements of the
    offence, as she was required to do according to the fifth step of the instruction
    set out in <em>R. v. Zhao</em>, 2013 ONCA 293, 297 C.C.C. (3d) 533, at para.
    107. Duty counsel argues that consent should have been prominent in the
    instruction because the presence or absence of consent was the key factual
    dispute in the case. She argues that while consent may be negated by
    intentionally caused bodily harm under the rule in <em>R. v. Jobidon</em>,
    [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714, psychological harm, which was put to the jury, cannot negate
    consent in the same way. Further, the trial judge failed to refer specifically
    to psychological harm on the element of intent to cause bodily harm. </span></p>

    argues that this was to the appellants benefit. The fifth step of <em>Zhao</em> is a second path to conviction in cases in which the jury is not satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused subjectively intended to cause
    bodily harm. By omitting this instruction, the trial judge closed off a
    potential route to conviction, which could not have prejudiced the appellant. Counsel
    for the respondent submits, further, that psychological harm is a form of
    bodily harm that may negate consent when it is subjectively intended and caused.
    Further, although psychological harm was put to the jury, the bulk of the
    evidence of harm was of physical harm; this was not a case that rested solely on
    psychological harm.</span></p>

    judge made it clear to the jury that to find the appellant guilty of sexual
    assault causing bodily harm it had to be satisfied that the appellant intentionally
    applied force to the complainant <span class=Underline>against her will</span>.
    Based on the trial judges instructions, the jury in this case must have found
    lack of consent. It was therefore unnecessary that the jury also find a subjective

    the risk of bodily harm was objectively foreseeable.</span></p>

    judge made it clear to the jury that to find the appellant guilty of sexual
    assault causing bodily harm, it had to be satisfied that the appellant
    intentionally applied force to the complainant against her will. On the element
    of intentional application of force, the trial judge stated: To be an
    assault, [the appellant] must apply the force intentionally and against [the

    left eye, or pinning her legs in a painful position against her wishes:</span></p>

    According to the defence, any injury to the complainant was purely accidental.
    The Crowns position was that the complainant did not consent. As stated by
    defence counsel in pre-charge discussion:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>I think it would be ridiculous for me to stand up in front of a

    count included lack of consent as an element along with intentional application
    of force. The trial judge noted in the instruction on consent on the count of
    assault with a weapon that [t]he defence does not dispute that if you conclude

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it was unnecessary that the trial
    judge provide a limiting instruction on bad character evidence in the
    circumstances of this case. The appellants trial counsel not only did not
    request such an instruction, he specifically asked the trial judge not to
    comment on the revelation that the appellant was in custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for the other two pieces of evidence, the I
    dont take no evidence was ambiguous and the appellant denied sending the text
    which allegedly contained that statement. The I kill people evidence was part
    of the evidence relied on by the Crown in support of the uttering death threats
    charge. The Crown relied on the statement for its intimidating effect and not
    for the truth of its contents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Had the trial judge given a limiting instruction
    concerning the latter two pieces of evidence, it could have been damaging to
    the appellant by drawing attention to the potentially prejudicial aspects of the
    evidence. Counsel had the opportunity to make submissions on the charge in a
    pre-charge conference. In the absence of a request for such an instruction from
    experienced defence counsel, I am not persuaded that the appellant suffered any
    prejudice through the absence of such an instruction. This ground of appeal is
    rejected.</span></p>

    that the jury charge was unbalanced because it overemphasized the Crowns
    evidence in comparison to the defences evidence. The appellant submits that
    the charge did not meet the legal standard of understanding the value and
    effect of the evidence, as required in <em>R. v. Azoulay</em>, [1952] 2 S.C.R.
    495. As an example, duty counsel points to the charge on unlawful confinement
    which provided a long explanation of the Crowns evidence followed by a brief
    statement that the appellant denies this evidence. The appellant also submits
    on his own behalf that the charge was unbalanced as it ignored key defence
    evidence and did not include evidence of the weaknesses in the complainants
    credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent submits that the charge was
    balanced. The defences theory of the case was put to the jury over 16 pages of
    transcript. The Crowns theory took up approximately 18 pages. Then the trial
    judge provided a chronology of events, which related both Crown and defence
    evidence to the jury. The instruction on each count consisted of mainly legal
    instruction. Both Crown evidence and defence evidence were mentioned briefly on
    each count. The respondent submits that when read as a whole, on a functional
    approach, this charge was balanced.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The jury charge met the legal requirement to
    review the <em>substantial</em> parts of the evidence and give the jury the
    position of the defence so that the jury may appreciate the value and effect of
    that evidence and how the law is to be applied to the facts as it finds them: <em>R.
    v. Huard</em>, 2013 ONCA 650, 311 O.A.C. 181, at para. 53 (emphasis in
    original). It cannot be the case that the amount of time spent reviewing the
    parties evidence must be exactly equal. Neither <em>Huard</em> nor <em>Azoulay</em> imposes such a strict requirement. The appellant raises <em>R. v. Baltovich</em> (2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 481,<em> </em>at paras. 112-119, in which this court found
    that a jury charge was unbalanced. However, the jury charge in <em>Baltovich </em>unduly
    promoted the case for the Crown and effectively ignored and denigrated the case
    for the defence (at para. 113). As long as the substance of the defence
    position was put to the jury, the fact that the trial judge spent more time on
    Crown evidence than on defence evidence is not a sufficient basis to find that
    the charge was unbalanced. The trial judge reviewed the defence evidence during
    the sections of the charge on the theory of the case and the chronology. Then,
    the trial judge briefly reviewed the relevant evidence during the instruction
    on particular counts. The jury would have appreciated the value and effect of
    the defence evidence. </span></p>

    duty counsel submits that the sentencing judge failed to make independent

    judge left many paths to conviction open to the jury; however, on sentencing, she
    assumed that the appellant was convicted on all of those bases.</span></p>

    on the offender to justify an award of enhanced credit and if the accuseds
    conduct in jail suggests that he is unlikely to be granted early release or
    parole, the judge may be justified in withholding enhanced credit. Mr. Nelson
    has had three incidents of discipline while in jail. This justifies denying

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court recently told us in <em>Summers</em> at para. 79, that [t]he onus is on the offender to demonstrate that he should
    be awarded enhanced credit as a result of his pre-sentence detention. While defence
    counsel did not request enhanced credit in submissions on sentencing, this is
    not determinative.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Justice Karakatsanis continued at para. 79:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Generally speaking, the fact that pre-sentence detention has
    occurred will usually be sufficient to give rise to an inference that the
    offender has lost eligibility for parole or early release, justifying enhanced
    credit. Of course, the Crown may respond by challenging such an inference. There
    will be particularly dangerous offenders who have committed certain serious
    offences for whom early release and parole are simply not available. Similarly,
    if the accuseds conduct in jail suggests that he is unlikely to be granted
    early release or parole, the judge may be justified in withholding enhanced
    credit. Extensive evidence will rarely be necessary. A practical approach is
    required that does not complicate or prolong the sentencing process.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant spent 19 months in pre-sentence
    custody. According to <em>Summers</em>, this will generally be sufficient to
    justify enhanced credit. The respondent has not successfully challenged the
    inference that the appellant has lost eligibility for early release or parole. The
    respondent raised three incidents for which the appellant was disciplined while
    in custody. However, the respondent has not convinced me that these incidents
    are sufficiently serious such that the appellant, a first-time offender, would
    be denied early release or parole. Additionally, the sentencing judge relied on
    these disciplinary actions as an aggravating factor in sentencing. Just as Karakatsanis
    J. explained, at paras. 81-83 of <em>Summers,</em> that mitigating factors
    related to the circumstances of the offender cannot be double count[ed] to
    justify enhanced credit, aggravating factors should not be double counted
    either.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Contrary to the submissions of the appellant,

lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under s. 724(2)(a)-(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    a sentencing judge must accept as proven all facts that are essential to the
    jurys guilty verdict, and may find other relevant facts disclosed by evidence
    at trial. A sentencing judge is not permitted to make findings of fact that are
    consistent only with a verdict rejected by the jury: <em>R. v. Ferguson</em>,
    2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 17. The appellant relies on <em>R. v.
    Cooney</em> (1995), 80 O.A.C. 89 (C.A.), to argue that where the factual basis
    for a jury verdict is uncertain, the sentencing judge must assume that the jury
    took the most lenient path to conviction. However, this view is inconsistent
    with the Supreme Courts decision in <em>Ferguson</em> and was expressly
    rejected in <em>R. v. Roncaioli</em>, 2011 ONCA 378, 271 C.C.C. (3d) 385, at
    para. 59.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While the sentencing judges findings of fact
    did not represent the minimum facts on which the jury could possibly have
    reached a guilty verdict, no finding of fact made on sentencing was consistent
    only with a verdict rejected by the jury. Notably, the sentencing judge did not
    find as a fact that the appellant had attempted to choke the complainant, and
    therefore there is no inconsistency with the acquittal on attempted choking. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor were the findings of fact on sentencing
    inconsistent with the jurys acquittal on aggravated sexual assault. The sentencing
    judge appeared to be satisfied that the appellant held a knife or scissors to
    the complainants throat. While this finding of fact would have been consistent
    with a finding of guilt on aggravated sexual assault, it is also consistent
    with an acquittal. The jury may have acquitted on that count because it was not
    satisfied that the appellant intended to wound or endanger the life of the
    complainant. It is not clear how the jury reached its acquittal on aggravated
    assault; however, a sentencing judge should not attempt to follow the logical
    process of the jury: <em>Ferguson</em>, at para. 18. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the verdict.</span></p>
