  <p class=Judge>Laskin J.A.:</p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marco Viscomi applies for bail pending his appeal of the order
    committing him for extradition to the United States, and his application for
    judicial review of the Minister’s surrender order. The Attorney General of
    Canada opposes the application for bail. </p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:none'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-transform:none'>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The United States has alleged that Viscomi, using manipulation,
    extortion and threats of violence, coerced two sisters, aged 13 and 17 and
    living in Virginia, into performing sadistic sexual acts with each other in
    front of a webcam while he watched and captured images on his computer for his
    pleasure. The webcam session took place over Skype<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> in the middle of the night of January 5-6, 2012, and lasted about an hour and
    ten minutes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viscomi was arrested under the <em>Extradition Act</em> on August 9,
    2012. He applied for bail pending his committal hearing. On August 16, Benotto
    J. denied bail. Although she recognized that Viscomi had the loving and devoted
    support of his parents, she concluded that there was a substantial likelihood
    he would reoffend and that the protection of the public required his detention.
    Viscomi has been in custody continuously since Benotto J.’s order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dates of the committal and surrender orders are as follows:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>May 24, 2013: K.L. Campbell J. orders Viscomi’s committal for
    extradition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>October 17, 2013: The Minister orders Viscomi’s surrender.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>November 12, 2014: The Minister refuses to reconsider his
    surrender order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the United States, Viscomi will face charges relating to child
    pornography and child luring, and, if convicted, mandatory sentences of up to
    30 years in jail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal and judicial review materials are all available. Thus the
    hearing before this court can and should be held no later than early spring
    2015.</p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:none'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-transform:none'>The Application</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This application is brought under s. 20 of the <em>Extradition Act</em>.
    Section 20 states that the bail pending appeal provision of s. 679 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, with any modifications the circumstances may require, applies to judicial
    interim release pending appeal of a committal order and judicial review of a
    surrender order. Viscomi must therefore satisfy three criteria. He must show:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>His appeal is not frivolous;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He is not a flight risk; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>His detention is not necessary in the public interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main criterion that is modified in the extradition context is the
    public interest criterion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viscomi submits that he has met all three criteria for bail and should
    be released on the stringent release plan put before me. The Attorney General
    of Canada submits that Viscomi has met none of the criteria.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering this application, I accept two preliminary points Viscomi’s counsel
    made. One, this is a new bail hearing under s. 20 of the <em>Extradition Act</em>.
    Thus, the order of Benotto J., made under s. 18(1)(b), is not entitled to any
    deference. Two, whether entitled to or not, I do not rely on the evidence of Daryl
    Hawke, a civilian member of the Ontario Provincial Police. Hawke testified at
    the bail hearing before Benotto J. and described his examination of the
    computer equipment seized following Viscomi’s arrest on Canadian charges.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this application, for reasons I will elaborate on, I conclude:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viscomi has not raised any arguable ground of appeal from his
    committal order;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viscomi is not a flight risk; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The public interest, standing alone, does not require Viscomi’s
    detention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    I have found no arguable ground of appeal, I dismiss Viscomi’s application for
    bail. I do so without prejudice to its renewal, should he be able to put
    forward an arguable ground of appeal or judicial review.</p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>No arguable ground of
    appeal</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    appeal is not frivolous if it raises an arguable issue or ground of appeal. This
    is a low bar. Nonetheless, on the material before me, I am not persuaded that
    Viscomi has met this criterion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    has put forward two main grounds of appeal challenging the correctness of the
    committal order (he has not put forward any submissions on the Minister’s
    surrender order). First, the extradition judge erred in ordering Viscomi’s
    committal because the evidence was not reasonably capable of supporting a
    finding of guilt. Second, the police obtained Viscomi’s subscriber information
    from his internet service provider without a warrant, and in the light of the
    Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em>R. v. Spencer</em><a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> – decided after these committal proceedings – this likely constitutes a breach
    of s. 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. And arguably,
    the evidence the police obtained from the internet service provider will be
    excluded under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. I reject both grounds.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence on the committal order was sufficient</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal comes down to two questions: Did the extradition judge apply
    the right test? And, if so, was there evidence to support his committal order?
    I answer yes to both questions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    extradition judge considered the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in <em>United
    States of America v. Ferras</em>,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> <em>R. v. Arcuri</em><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> and <em>R. v. Sazant</em>,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> which respectively set out the general test for committal, the test to be
    applied when there is, as in this case, circumstantial evidence, and the
    impropriety of weighing competing inferences at the committal stage. The
    extradition judge expressly applied the decision of this court in <em>United
    States of America v. Leonard</em>,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> where, at para. 31, Sharpe J.A. set out the appropriate test:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The extradition judge applied the correct test for committal:
    was there available and reliable evidence upon which a reasonable jury,
    properly instructed, could convict a sought person for the corresponding
    Canadian offence listed in the Authorization to Proceed. …Where, as in this
    case, the evidence is circumstantial in nature, an extradition judge must weigh
    the evidence, in the sense of assessing whether it is reasonably capable of
    supporting the inferences the trier of fact will be asked to make. “If the
    inferences required are within the field of inferences available on the whole
    of the evidence, nothing else matters”. [Citations omitted.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    this test, the extradition judge concluded, at para. 17, that “the evidence in
    the certified record of the case permits the reasonable inference to be drawn
    that the respondent was the perpetrator of the offence.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viscomi
    accepts that a crime was committed. But he contends that the evidence
    identifying him as the perpetrator is insufficient to justify his committal to
    stand trial in the United States. I do not accept that his contention is even
    arguable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed evidence in the Record of the Case supporting the trial judge’s
    conclusion is as follows:</p>

    inference is that the accused committed the offence. The extradition judge in
    this case determined that from the evidence in the Record of the Case, it was
    reasonable to draw the inference that Viscomi committed these offences. Although
    Viscomi argued that independent confirmatory evidence was required, I do not

    Zing’s customers also agree Zing has the right to disclose any information
    needed to satisfy any government request. In accordance with its agreement,
    Zing voluntarily disclosed to the police the name and residential address of

    breached Viscomi’s s. 8 <em>Charter</em> rights. However, that breach does not
    justify granting bail because it must be considered in conjunction with s.
    24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. And, as in <em>Spencer</em>, I cannot see any

    argues, however, that the s. 24(2) analysis in this case differs from that in <em>Spencer</em> because the unconstitutionally obtained subscriber information led to <i>Criminal
    Code </i>search warrants, which were used to seize computers and hard drives
    that were then improperly sent to the United States under the M<em>utual Legal Assistance
    in Criminal Matters Act</em><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span

    it has no bearing on the committal proceedings because the fruits of the search
    (the computers and hard drives) were not incorporated into the Record of the Case.
    On the basis of this court’s decision in <em>United States of America. v.
    McAmmond</em>,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    suggesting Viscomi was a flight risk, the Attorney General of Canada did not
    press this point. I do not consider Viscomi to be a flight risk. He has no
    criminal record and no history of flight. The police seized his passport during
    the execution of the <em>Criminal Code</em> search warrants. Although Viscomi
    is pursuing medical studies in Australia, these studies have been put on hold
    pending the disposition of the extradition proceedings. His proposed release
    plan stipulates that he will remain in Ontario and not apply for a passport or
    other travel documents. Thus, Viscomi has met this criterion.</p>

    chambers decisions of this court bear on the public interest criterion in
    extradition proceedings: the decision of Simmons J.A. in <em>Canada (Attorney

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[12]</span></span></span></a><em> </em>and the decision of Doherty J.A. in <em>France v. Ouzghar</em>.<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[13]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Raghoonanan</em>, Simmons J.A. noted, at paras. 34-35, that the public
    interest in detaining an applicant is less compelling in the case of an appeal
    of a committal order under the <em>Extradition Act</em> than in the case of an
    appeal from a conviction under the <em>Criminal Code</em>. In the extradition
    context, the applicant has not been convicted of anything and is presumed
    innocent. In the <em>Criminal Code</em> context, the applicant has been
    convicted and the court must balance the reviewability and enforcement of the
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Ouzghar</em>, Doherty J.A. said that in extradition proceedings, the only
    reason Canada has any cause to place an applicant in custody is to facilitate
    the applicant’s surrender to a foreign country. That surrender, of course, will
    not occur at least until this court has disposed of the applicant’s appeal and
    judicial review application. Thus to quote Doherty J.A., at para. 12:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Absent some substantive cause specific to the applicant to
    justify detention, the public interest considered in the context of an
    extradition proceeding is not served by incarceration that does not facilitate
    the applicant’s surrender to the requesting country.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the substantive public interest concerns the Attorney General of Canada puts
    forward to justify Viscomi’s continued detention are the public perception of
    the reputation of the administration of justice and the likelihood Viscomi will
    reoffend. In my view, Viscomi’s proposed release plan adequately addresses these
    concerns.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed release plan is very restrictive. It amounts to house arrest (save for
    five hours per week), under which Viscomi’s parents would maintain custody over
    their cell phones and laptops, change the passwords on them daily and lock them
    up at night. The plan provides Viscomi is not to use, possess or access any device
    that can connect to the internet. Wireless internet would be disabled. Under
    the plan, Viscomi would effectively have no way to access the internet and thus
    reoffend inside his parents’ home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, he would likely be prevented from reoffending outside the home. Under
    the proposed release plan, Viscomi would be subject to electronic monitoring,
    which would restrict his ability to leave his parents’ home. In practical terms,
    electronic monitoring should prevent him from going, for example, to an
    internet café, and reoffending.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge that the release plan, though very restrictive, is not foolproof.
    Viscomi’s parents have jobs, which would leave Viscomi alone and unsupervised
    in the home for more than 20 hours per week. Moreover, an employee of the
    proposed electronic monitoring company, Jemtec Inc., swore an affidavit in
    which he acknowledged as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am aware that Jemtec does not believe that any electronic
    monitoring system can:</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of the diminished public interest in detention in the extradition
    context, and the restrictive bail plan, I do not think that by itself the
    public interest would justify Viscomi’s continued detention pending his appeal
    and application for judicial review.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have not been persuaded that Viscomi has raised an arguable ground of appeal
    from his committal order. For this reason alone, I would dismiss his
    application for bail. He shall have until January 9, 2015, to perfect his
    appeal and application for judicial review. They should then be scheduled for
    an early hearing in 2015.</p>

    assigns to a subscriber when the subscriber’s device connects to the internet.
    Internet service providers keep track of the dates and times that IP addresses
    are assigned to their subscribers. They can thus determine when a subscriber’s
    account was used to access the internet at any given time. But, as Doherty J.A.
    notes in <em>R. v. Ward</em>, 2012 ONCA 660, 112 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 23,
    this is not conclusive proof that the subscriber accessed the internet: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>However
    that does not necessarily mean that the subscriber himself or herself was using
    the computer connected to the Internet at that time, or that it was even the

    access point. When more than one computer is accessing the Internet through a
    shared access point at the same time, there are additional technical issues
