  <p class=Judge><strong>Feldman J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In each of these three appeals, the plaintiffs are representative
    plaintiffs in a class proceeding. They are each claiming damages under Part
    XXIII.1 of the <em>Securities Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5,<em> </em>s. 138.3,<em> </em>for misrepresentations alleged to have been made in respect of shares
    trading in the secondary market. In each case, the representative plaintiff
    commenced a class proceeding for common law negligent misrepresentation and in
    that statement of claim they each also made the statutory claim. The statutory
    claims are based on the new statutory cause of action under Part XXIII.1, which
    came into force on December 31, 2005. The statutory cause of action is found in
    s. 138.3, reproduced in Schedule A.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In each case, the statement of claim was issued and served within the
    three-year limitation period for bringing the statutory claim (s.138.14), but
    in each case, leave to commence the statutory action (s.138.8) was not obtained
    within the three-year period.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this courts decision in <em>Sharma v. Timminco</em>, 2012 ONCA 107,
    109 O.R. (3d) 569, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2012] S.C.C.A. No. 157
    (<em>Timminco</em>), the court held that the statutory claim is
    statute-barred if leave to commence the action is not obtained within the
    three-year limitation period, and that s. 28 of the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992, </em>S.O. 1992, c.6 (<em>CPA</em>)<em> </em>does not suspend the running of
    the limitation period in favour of class members until leave has been obtained.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three experienced class proceedings judges who decided these cases
    dealt with the expiry of the limitation period in different ways. In <em>Green
    v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</em>, 2012 ONSC 3637, 219 A.C.W.S. (3d)
    692, (<em>Green v. CIBC</em>), Strathy J. held that there was no avenue
    available to relieve against the passage of the limitation period in light of
    the decision in <em>Timminco</em>. In <em>Silver v. IMAX Corp.</em>, [2009]
    O.J. No. 5573, 66 B.L.R. (4th) 222 (S.C.J.), leave to appeal to Ont. Div. Ct.
    refused, 2011 ONSC 1035, 105 O.R. (3d) 212, van Rensburg J. had already granted
    leave after the expiry of the limitation period. In 2012 ONSC 4881, [2012] O.J.
    No. 4002, she ordered that the leave that had been granted to commence the
    action applied <em>nunc pro tunc</em> within the limitation period. Both decisions
    will hereafter be referred to as <i>Silver v. IMAX</i>. In <em>Trustees of
    the Millwright Regional Council of Ontario Pension Trust Fund v. Celestica
    Inc., </em>2012 ONSC 6083, 113 O.R. (3d) 264 (<em>Celestica</em>), Perell J.
    held that leave could be granted after the expiry of the limitation period by
    applying the doctrine of special circumstances. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three appeals were heard together by a five-judge panel of this
    court to allow the court to decide whether to reconsider the decision in <em>Timminco</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Timminco</em> courts interpretation of the term asserted in
    s. 28 of the <i>CPA</i> was a viable one based on the arguments made and the
    record before it in that case. However, when the consequence of the
    interpretation, which leaves class members without the normal s. 28 protection
    from the passage of the limitation period, is assessed in light of the purpose
    and intent of the new statutory claim, we have concluded that the
    interpretation given is not correct and the decision of the court should be
    overturned. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brief Procedural Background of the three Appeals</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Green v. CIBC</em>, the applications for certification under the <em>CPA</em> and for leave to proceed under Part XXIII.1 of the <em>Securities Act</em> were
    heard together by Strathy J. <em>Timminco</em> was released on the second last
    day of the motion. Strathy J. would have granted leave and certification but
    following the decision in <em>Timminco, </em>he dismissed the leave application
    and the statutory action as time-barred.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Silver v. IMAX</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> van Rensburg J. had already granted leave before <em>Timminco</em> was
    released. Following the release of <em>Timminco</em>, the defendants applied
    for summary judgment to dismiss the action as time-barred when leave was
    granted. Justice van Rensburg dismissed the motion and made the grant of leave
    apply <em>nunc pro tunc</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The proceedings
    below in </span></strong><em>Celestica</em><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'> are not as far advanced as those in the other two appeals. The Ontario
    litigation was held in abeyance while a parallel action proceeded through the
    courts in the United States. The plaintiffs did not file a notice of motion to
    seek leave until after </span></strong><em>Timminco</em><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'> was released in 2012. Perell J. refused to strike
    the claim as statute-barred by applying the doctrine of special circumstances. He
    held that leave could be granted </span></strong><em>nunc pro tunc</em><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'> on the facts of </span></strong><em>Celestica</em>,
    if the plaintiffs met the leave test<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></strong></p>
  <h1><strong>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>The Decision in </strong><em>Sharma v. Timminco</em></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Timminco</em>, the representative plaintiff commenced a class
    proceeding in May 2009. The pleading alleged that misrepresentations by the
    defendants between March and November 2008 affected the value of the Timminco
    shares that traded in the secondary market. It claimed damages for negligent
    misrepresentation on a class-wide basis. The statement of claim also stated
    that the plaintiff intended to move for an order permitting the Plaintiff to
    assert the statutory causes of action and to then deliver an amended statement
    of claim to plead them.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early 2011, as the expiry of the three-year limitation period under
    Part XXIII.1 approached and the plaintiff had not yet brought the motion for
    leave (or a motion to certify the class proceeding), he sought and obtained an
    order from the class proceedings judge, Perell J. The order declared that the
    effect of s. 28 of the <em>CPA</em> was to suspend the running of the
    limitation period in favour of all class members, including the representative
    plaintiff, once the statutory claim was asserted or mentioned in a statement of
    claim and before leave to commence the statutory action was obtained. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants appealed that decision to this court. On appeal, this
    court reversed the decision of the motion judge. The court held that where a
    statement of claim in a class proceeding states that the statutory claim will
    be made based on the facts pleaded and that leave will be sought, s. 28 of the <em>CPA </em>does not suspend the running of the limitation period in favour of any
    member of the class unless leave to commence the statutory claim has first been
    obtained from the court.</p>
  <h1 style='line-height:115%'>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Effect of <span class=EmphasisStrongChar>Timminco </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar><span style='font-style:normal'>on the three cases now
    under appeal</span></span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the decision in <i>Timminco</i> was released on February 16, 2012,
    the result came as a great surprise to the securities class action bar. Strathy
    J. observed in <em>Green v. CIBC</em> at para. 475 that: Counsel for the
    individual defendants aptly described the decision, at that time, as a thunderbolt.
    The immediate effect of the courts decision was that the statutory claims in a
    number of cases were either statute-barred  as in the cases now before the
    court  or would likely become statute-barred before the three-year limitation
    period expired. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the three cases before the court, a class action had been commenced
    within the three-year limitation period provided by s. 138.14(1) of the <em>Securities
    Act</em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    General Insurance Co.</em> (2005), 76 O.R. (3d) 161, this court described the
    circumstances in which it would revisit and reverse a previous decision of the
    court in the context of recognizing the importance of adhering to the doctrine
    of <em>stare decisis</em>. Previously, some judgments of this court had taken a
    more rigid approach, requiring errors to fit within one of the traditional
    exceptions to <em>stare decisis</em>. In <em>Polowin</em>, a case involving the
    interpretation of a provision of the <em>Insurance Act, </em><span
style='color:black'>R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 </span>and a regulation under the Act<em>, </em>this court held that it could overrule its previous decision that had
    misinterpreted those provisions, regardless of whether the type of error fit
    into one of the traditional exceptions. Writing for the court in <em>Polowin, </em>Laskin
    J.A. articulated the preferred approach at para. 127, as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[127] Instead of focusing on phrases such as &quot;manifestly
    wrong&quot;, the approach I prefer is that adopted by this court in <em>R. v.

    of correcting the error in a previous decision. This approach focuses on the
    nature of the error, and the effect and future impact of either correcting it
    or maintaining it. In doing so, this approach not only takes into account the
    effect and impact on the parties and future litigants, but also on the
    integrity and administration of our justice system.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the approach taken in <em>Polowin</em>, the first issue to be determined
    is whether the court in<em> Timminco</em> erred in its interpretation of s. 28
    of the <em>CPA </em>and s. 138.8(1) of the <em>Securities Act. </em>To do that,
    it is necessary to review the <em>Timminco</em> decision in order to identify
    specifically what the case decided. As already noted, <em>Timminco</em> was a
    class action proceeding for alleged misrepresentations in the secondary market
    that caused the value of Timminco shares to fall and the class members to
    suffer losses. Along with common law causes of action in negligence and negligent
    misrepresentation, the statement of claim included para. 117, which provided:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>117. The Plaintiff intends to deliver a notice of motion
    seeking, among other things, an Order permitting the Plaintiff to assert the
    statutory causes of action particularized in Part XXIII.1 of the Securities
    Act, and if granted, to amend this Statement of Claim to plead these causes of
    action. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike the common law cause of action for negligent misrepresentation,
    the statutory cause of action under Part XXIII.1 of the <em>Securities Act </em>allows
    an investor to recover for losses suffered without proving any reliance on the
    misrepresentation in the purchase or sale of shares. Consequently, the same
    facts surrounding the misrepresentation and its effect on the share price can
    ground both the common law cause of action and the statutory cause of action.
    However, the statutory cause of action requires leave of the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the heading Leave to Proceed, s. 138.8(1) of the <em>Securities
    Act</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>138.8(1) No action may be commenced under s. 138.3
    without leave of the court granted upon motion with notice to each defendant.
    The court shall grant leave only where it is satisfied that,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(a) the action is being brought in good faith; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(b) there is a reasonable possibility that the action
    will be resolved at trial in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Timminco</em>, the court stated at para. 15 that it was not
    disputed that because leave had not been granted, the class proceeding is not
    an action commenced under s. 138.3.  Therefore, whether leave of the court had
    to be obtained before a statement of claim could issue that commenced the
    action was not before the court in <em>Timminco</em>. The only issue before the
    court was whether the application of s. 28 of the <em>CPA</em> would
    nevertheless suspend the running of the limitation period for all class members
    before leave was obtained because the statutory cause of action was asserted
    in the class action statement of claim for negligent misrepresentation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 28 of the <em>CPA</em> is the provision that addresses how
    limitation periods operate in the context of class actions and reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>28. (1) Subject to subsection (2), any limitation
    period applicable to <em>a cause of action asserted in a class proceeding </em>is
    suspended in favour of a class member on the commencement of the class
    proceeding and resumes running against the class member when,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(a) the member opts out of the class proceeding;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(b) an amendment that has the effect of excluding the
    member from the class is made to the certification order;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(c) a decertification order is made under section 10;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(d) the class proceeding is dismissed without an
    adjudication on the merits;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(e) the class proceeding is abandoned or discontinued
    with the approval of the court; or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(f) the class proceeding is settled with the approval
    of the court, unless the settlement provides otherwise. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to come within s. 28 of the <em>CPA</em>, the s.138.3 cause of
    action had to have been asserted in a class proceeding. In order to interpret
    the term asserted, the court referred, at para. 17, to two dictionary
    definitions of assert: make or enforce a claim to (<i>assert ones rights</i>)
    and to invoke or enforce (a legal right). Focusing on the second meaning,
    enforce a claim or legal right, the court reasoned that because the statutory
    cause of action could not be enforced without leave being obtained, it could
    not be asserted before leave is obtained. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court identified five bases of support for this interpretation. The
    first two reflected access to justice concerns for the class members. First,
    the fact that none of the subsections of s. 28(1) that recommence the running
    of the limitation period depends on the granting or denial of leave means that
    class members could have the limitation period suspended to protect them, but
    the class action may never proceed. Similarly, the protective purpose of s. 28
    would be thwarted where no leave motion is brought. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, it was not the purpose of s. 28 to put class action plaintiffs in
    a better position than individual plaintiffs by suspending the limitation
    period before leave only for class action plaintiffs but not for individual
    plaintiffs. Fourth, the courts interpretation furthered the object of s.
    138.14 of the <em>Securities Act</em>, the limitation period for the statutory
    claim, by forcing plaintiffs to proceed with the leave motion expeditiously.
    Fifth, in answer to an anticipated concern, the court observed that its
    interpretation would not have the effect of making s. 28 inapplicable to s.
    138.3 claims for misrepresentation in the secondary market; s. 28 would apply
    to suspend the running of the limitation period, but only once an action was
    commenced with leave. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the decision in <em>Timminco</em> is that representative
    plaintiffs are required to both move for and obtain leave of the court, and to
    commence a class action containing a claim under s. 138.3, within the
    three-year limitation period provided in s. 138.14 of the <em>Securities Act</em> (or the abbreviated period, if it becomes applicable  ss.
    138.14(a)(ii),(b)(ii),(c)(ii)). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obtaining leave within time may prove either difficult or impossible,
    depending on a number of circumstances. Two are most significant. Because the
    limitation period is not dependant on the discovery or the discoverability of
    the misrepresentation, the action must be commenced within three years of the misrepresentation.
    The longer it takes to discover the misrepresentation, the shorter is the
    period available to conduct the leave motion (and any appeals), obtain leave
    and commence the action. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then once the motion for leave is launched, the timing of the hearing is
    only partially within the control of the moving party. For example, the
    defendants may initiate procedural steps that could cause delay. As well, court
    availability can affect the timing of the hearing and the decision. In <em>Silver
    v. IMAX</em>, the leave motion had been argued and was under reserve when the
    limitation period expired. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that a plaintiff cannot unilaterally control whether its claim

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 28 of the <em>CPA</em> has its genesis in the discussion and
    recommendation contained in chapter 19 of the Ontario Law Reform Commissions <em>Report
    on Class Actions</em> (Toronto: Ministry of the Attorney General, 1982). The
    issue before the Commission was clearly articulated in the first paragraph of
    the chapter at p. 771:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A statute of limitations operates to prevent a party from
    commencing proceedings after the passage of a specific period of time,
    generally measured from the accrual of the cause of action. As a general rule,
    time ceases to run upon the commencement of an action within that specified
    period of time. It is clear that, when a representative plaintiff commences a
    class action, this result will follow insofar as the individual cause of action
    of the class representative is concerned. However, what of the causes of action
    of the absent class members? Does time likewise cease to run? If so, when does
    this occur: upon the commencement of the class action; upon the granting of
    certification; or, for example, upon the filing of a motion to intervene?
    Without statutory guidance, no certain answer is possible. Equally uncertain is
    the time when the limitation period, if suspended, will resume running against
    the absent class members. In the opinion of the Commission, these matters are
    important and should be dealt with in the proposed <em>Class Actions Act</em>.</p>

    O.J. No. 418, 36 C.P.C. (5th) 176 (S.C.J.), affd, [2004] O.J. No. 2769, 71
    O.R. (3d) 451 (C.A.), at para. 24, Winkler J. quoted  the Discussion of s. 28
    of the <em>CPA</em> in the <em>Report</em> <em>of the Attorney Generals
    Advisory Committee on Class Action Reform </em>(Toronto, 1990) as follows: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given the number of potential class members and the fact that
    many of them are absent and require protection, care must be taken to ensure
    that their rights are not prejudiced by the commencement of a class proceeding.
    Limitation periods are therefore suspended until a party decides to act alone
    (opting-out) or until determination has been made in the proceeding itself.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an individual action where s. 28 of the <em>CPA</em> does not apply,
    when a person commences an action before the expiry of the applicable
    limitation period the action has been commenced within time and time ceases to
    run. This is also what normally occurs for the representative plaintiff in the
    context of a class proceeding: the clock stops running for him or her because
    the action is in time. The concern is for the other class members who have not
    commenced their own actions and will not need to do so if the class action is
    certified and proceeds. If it does not proceed, it is only in the case of the
    other class members that the limitation period may resume running. It will not
    normally resume running against the representative plaintiff because that
    person has an action commenced within time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The role of the representative plaintiff in a class action from a
    limitation point of view is to properly commence the action within the
    limitation period. Where a proceeding is commenced by the representative
    plaintiff within the limitation period, the other class members are, in effect,
    sheltered by the timeliness of the representative plaintiffs action. The
    contrary is also true: the other class members get no protection from an
    untimely proceeding.  That is, unless the representative plaintiff commences
    the action effectively within the limitation period, then time does not cease
    to run for the other class members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of s. 28 was explained by Winkler J. and confirmed by this
    court in <em>Logan,</em> where the defendant argued that a class proceeding is
    only commenced once it is certified and, until then, it is an individual action
    and does not attract the protection of s. 28 for the rest of the class members.
    Winkler J. rejected that interpretation. He explained that the <em>CPA</em> is
    remedial legislation enacted to enhance access to justice for those with
    uneconomic individual claims. To require each such person to start his or her
    own action while waiting to see if the representative action is certified would
    defeat the purpose of s. 28 and the legislation as a whole. The court held that
    under s. 28, the commencement of the class action occurs when the claim is
    issued. It is at that time, and not when the claim is certified, that the
    limitation period is suspended for all class members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 28 recognizes that different causes of action can be asserted in
    one statement of claim and that they may have different, applicable limitation
    periods. Each such limitation period is suspended when each cause of action is
    effectively asserted in the action within the applicable limitation period. </p>

    touchstones of corporate responsibility to the investing public. Together with
    the supervisory, regulatory authority of the Securities Commission, civil
    actions are an important way of obtaining compliance with the corporate
    obligation for ongoing, accurate disclosure. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new statutory claim for misrepresentation in the secondary market
    under s. 138.3 of the <em>Securities Act </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(see
    Schedule A)</span></em> was intended to be remedial legislation with the twin
    goals of a) facilitating and enhancing access to justice for investors, and b)
    deterring corporate misconduct and negligence. By removing the need to prove
    reliance by an individual investor in order to obtain a remedy, the new action
    makes it easier and more cost-effective for investors to prove their claims.  It
    thereby achieves compensation for investors (although with a damages cap), and
    by so doing, discourages corporate actors from making misrepresentations in
    their post-prospectus continuous disclosure.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In formulating the new civil remedy, both the Allen Committee that
    prepared the original report to the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the Canadian
    Securities Administrators (CSA) that prepared follow-up comments and draft
    legislation, focused on ensuring that the proposed legislative remedy would
    balance the interests of all potential parties and actors. This meant providing
    statutory defences for the corporate actors, a cap on the amount of damages
    that could be recoverable, and a defined three-year limitation period from the
    date of the misrepresentation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Allen Committee final report, titled <em>Final Report:
    Responsible Corporate Disclosure: A Search for Balance</em> (Toronto: The
    Toronto Stock Exchange Committee on Corporate Disclosure, 1997), which
    recommended the new statutory action, the committee concluded that to achieve
    the dual goals of a remedy for aggrieved investors and deterrence of corporate
    issuers, the most appropriate form of action would be a class proceeding under
    the <em>CPA</em>. The authors summarized their conclusion at para. 4.6:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>4.6 The Committee concluded that the combination of class
    actions with statutory civil liability for a misrepresentation in continuous
    disclosure, properly designed, would provide the benefits of better disclosure
    without unduly facilitating meritless litigation. The objective is to provide
    aggrieved investors with a remedy the potential exercise of which would act as
    a deterrent to misrepresentations (similar to liability for a prospectus
    misrepresentation) without facilitating extortionate class actions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the largest concerns of potential defendants following the Allen
    Report recommendation remained the strike suit, which had become prevalent in
    the United States. In a strike suit, a class action lawyer would sue on a
    corporate statement whenever the share price fell, in order to obtain a quick
    settlement from the corporation, regardless of the merit of the claim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to meet this concern, two further protections were later added
    to the proposed new action by the CSA to prevent strike suits in Canada; one
    was court-approved settlements. The other was a screening mechanism that
    required a plaintiff to seek leave of the court to commence an action, where
    the court would consider the merits of the proposed action by examining the
    evidence and determining whether the action was being brought in good faith and
    had a reasonable possibility of success. That is the leave requirement in s.
    138.8 of the <em>Securities Act.</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The result was the provision of the new statutory remedy for
    misrepresentation in ongoing disclosure, best pursued as a class proceeding,
    which would achieve compensation for class members, but also corporate
    deterrence. The deterrence component is significantly weakened if the claims
    are brought only by individual investors, first because the involved loss
    amounts are smaller, but also because such actions are likely to be too
    expensive to pursue on an individual basis.</p>

    leave of the court to commence the action. The two dictionary meanings of
    assert set out by the court were to make or enforce a claim to and to
    invoke or enforce (a legal right). The court in <em>Timminco</em> focused on
    the enforcement aspect of the definitions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, using the same definitions, to assert a claim is also to make a
    claim or to invoke a legal right.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, by pleading the statutory claim under s. 138.3, the
    representative plaintiff is making the claim or invoking the legal right.
    Although the claim cannot be ultimately enforced unless leave is granted, by
    pleading the facts necessary to found the claim, the representative plaintiff
    is making the claim and invoking the legal right given by the statute. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if one viewed the word assert in s. 28 as ambiguous, because it
    is contained in a provision that gives the benefit of the suspension of a
    limitation period to class members, the ambiguity should be resolved in favour
    of those entitled to that benefit. In <em>Ordon Estate v. Grail</em>, [1998] 3
    S.C.R. 437, at para. 136, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that statutory
    provisions creating a limitation period are to be strictly construed in favour
    of the plaintiff. The Court referred to a statement by Estey J., writing for
    the majority of the Court in <em>Berardinelli v. Ontario Housing Corp.</em>, [1979]
    1 S.C.R. 275, at p. 280, that as a limitation provision circumscribes the
    rights of action of a citizen, any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of
    the person whose right of action is being truncated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Timminco,</em> the court raised the five concerns with this
    interpretation, referred to in paras. 22 and 23 above, some of which affect the
    rights of the defendants and some, the class action plaintiffs. The first was
    that the failure to seek leave or the denial of leave are not triggering events
    listed in s. 28(1) that restart the running of the limitation period. Therefore
    class members could be waiting indefinitely with no action proceeding. I
    believe the answer to this observation is that both the defendants and the
    class action case management judge will ensure that the motion for leave is
    proceeded with in a timely manner or the class action proceeding is dismissed.
    Dismissal without adjudication on the merits is one of the triggers (s.
    28(1)(d)) for resumption of the running of the limitation period. Of course, if
    leave is denied, the statutory claim is effectively at an end for all potential
    plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue raised in <i>Timminco</i> was that class members did
    not need the protective suspension of the limitation period that is the purpose
    of s. 28, where the representative plaintiff was not proceeding with the leave
    application. However, to the contrary, if a representative plaintiff is not
    proceeding and needs to be replaced, then the class members do need the
    protection of s. 28 during that time, otherwise they will each have to commence
    their own action and bring a leave motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third concern was that if asserting the claim without first
    obtaining leave has the effect of suspending the limitation period for class
    action plaintiffs under s. 28, this puts class action plaintiffs in a better
    position than an individual plaintiff, which is not the purpose of s. 28. I
    believe what the <em>Timminco</em> court was commenting on here is that by
    asserting the statutory cause of action in a statement of claim that commences
    another action, the effect of s. 28 is that it tolls the limitation period for
    all the class members, including the representative plaintiff, without having
    to first obtain leave and commence the statutory cause of action, as an
    individual plaintiff does. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that this is an unusual, if not anomalous effect of s. 28, in
    the context of the statutory claim. Normally, when a cause of action is
    asserted in a statement of claim, that statement of claim commences that cause
    of action. If the claim is commenced within the applicable limitation period,
    then the representative plaintiff has commenced his or her own action in time
    and the effect of s. 28 is only to suspend the limitation period for the other
    class members so that they need not commence their own actions. However, here
    the effect is to protect the representative plaintiff as well, who has not yet
    obtained leave and commenced the statutory action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, this effect is unusual. In this case, it means that
    class action members appear to have a procedural benefit or advantage that
    individual claimants do not, because individual claimants must obtain leave and
    commence the statutory action within the three-year limitation period. However,
    this result is not necessarily either inappropriate or unintended by s. 28. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not inappropriate because although the statutory claim can be made
    individually, the committees that formulated it and the legislature that
    enacted it expected the statutory claim to be used optimally through the
    procedural vehicle of a class proceeding.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> This was in order to accomplish the two purposes: 1) to enhance and facilitate
    access to justice for claimants; and 2) to have a significant deterrent effect
    on corporate actors. &nbsp;Therefore, it is not inappropriate to give the term
    asserted the purposive and effective interpretation which makes the statutory
    claim work successfully as a class proceeding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that if the effect of the application of s. 28 to the
    statutory claim is to give class members a procedural benefit over individual
    claimants, there is no basis to say that effect was unintended by s. 28 in this
    context. It furthers the intent of the drafters of the new statutory claim that
    the claim be primarily brought as a class action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the court in <em>Timminco</em> noted that the purpose of the
    three-year (or the abbreviated) limitation period for bringing secondary market
    misrepresentation claims (s. 138.14), is to ensure that such claims are brought
    and proceeded with expeditiously. An interpretation that does not require that
    leave be obtained within that period is inconsistent with that purpose. I will
    respond to this issue more fully in the next section of these reasons dealing
    with whether the <em>Timminco</em> judgment should be overruled.<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the court denied that the effect of its interpretation was to
    make s. 28 of the <i>CPA</i> inapplicable to s. 138.3 claims for
    misrepresentation in the secondary market. Rather, s. 28 would still suspend
    the running of the limitation period, but only once an action had been
    commenced with leave. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with this interpretive conclusion is that it does not give
    s. 28 its protective effect for class members. Before leave is granted in the
    class action, they would have to start their own individual actions and obtain
    leave individually to ensure that their personal claims were timely. This
    result undermines the purpose of s. 28 as envisioned by the Law Reform
    Commission and the Attorney Generals Advisory Committee, and as explained in <em>Logan</em> as well as in <em>Coulson v. Citigroup Markets Canada Inc</em>., 2010 ONSC
    1596, 92 C.P.C. (6th) 301, at para. 49; affd, 2012 ONCA 108, 288 O.A.C. 355.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:115%'>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Two
    arguments made in these appeals that address the issue whether the statutory
    action can be commenced before leave is obtained, rather than whether it can be
    asserted within the meaning of s. 28 of the <i>CPA</i> before leave is
    obtained </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As discussed in paragraph 19 of these reasons, it was not argued in <em>Timminco</em> that a class proceeding for the statutory remedy had been commenced without
    obtaining leave. The only issue was whether the statutory claim could be
    asserted, within the meaning of s. 28 of the <i>CPA</i>, without first
    obtaining leave, in a statement of claim that was properly commenced for
    another class action framed in negligent misrepresentation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part of the argument addressed to this court was based on a line of
    cases, culminating in this courts decision in <em>Re New Alger Mines Ltd. </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(1986)</span></em>, 54 O.R. (2d) 562 (C.A.), which
    holds that where a statute provides that leave is required to commence an
    action, leave can be obtained after the action is commenced in an order that is
    made <em>nunc pro tunc</em>. It was argued that similarly, this statutory claim
    could be commenced without first obtaining leave, as long as leave was later
    obtained by an order made <em>nunc pro tunc</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another submission that addressed the timing of commencing the statutory
    action was that one could examine the use of language contained in a number of
    subsections of s. 138 of the <em>Securities Act</em> to assist in interpreting
    the intention of the legislature as to whether leave had to be obtained before
    a statement of claim for the statutory claim could be issued. For example, the <i>Securities
    Act</i> refers to a motion for leave but also to an application for leave.
    It also refers to the parties to the motion as plaintiff and defendant, arguably
    suggesting an existing action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the focus of these appeals was on the issue decided in <em>Timminco</em><i>,</i> and because the procedural factual matrix of these appeals also mirrors that in <i>Timminco</i>, I have limited the decision in these appeals to the issue
    decided in <em>Timminco</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em> Accordingly,
    I do not address the two arguments just outlined.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:115%'><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(6)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></em>Conclusion on <em>Timminco</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the analysis discussed above, I conclude that <em>Timminco</em> wrongly held that:  1) a class action properly commenced cannot also assert a
    cause of action for the statutory remedy under s. 138.3 unless leave has first
    been obtained, and 2) before leave is obtained, s. 28 of the <em>CPA </em>does
    not suspend the limitation period for all class members in a properly commenced
    class proceeding that claims a remedy under s. 138.3 and proposes to seek
    leave. Allowing the statutory claim to be asserted with the common law claim
    provides for procedural simplicity and reconciliation of the respective
    purposes of the <i>CPA</i> and the <em>Securities Act</em>.</p>
  <h1 style='line-height:115%'>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is this a case where the court should overrule itS previous decision?</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the approach taken by this court in <em>Polowin</em>, which
    focuses on the effect and future impact of either correcting [the error] or
    maintaining it, in my view, the decision in <em>Timminco</em> should be
    overruled on these appeals for the following four reasons.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:115%'>(1) One of the
    main benefits of the class action, the suspension of the limitation period for
    all members of the class, has been removed</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As discussed above, the twin goals of the new statutory cause of action
    for misrepresentation in the secondary market were to facilitate access to
    justice for investors and to deter corporate misconduct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that neither of the twin goals will be effectively achieved
    if the class action procedure is not a viable one. However, that is an effect
    of the <em>Timminco</em> decision. As a result of the <em>Timminco</em> interpretation of the interaction between s. 28 of the <em>CPA</em> and ss.
    138.14 and 138.8 of the <em>Securities Act</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>,</span></em> there is no suspension of the three-year limitation
    period for class members when the representative plaintiff commences a class
    action for negligence which also seeks a s. 138.3 remedy but without first
    obtaining leave. This means that class members must do what s. 28 was intended
    to obviate: commence their own action with leave in order to try to ensure that
    their action is brought within the limitation period.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(2) <span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Timminco </span>undercuts the ability of investors to
    bring a class action within the limitation period because they do not have
    control of whether they can meet or toll the limitation period </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the decision In <em>Timminco</em> is that a representative
    plaintiff must move for and obtain leave to proceed (including the resolution
    of all appeals) before a class action can be commenced. This means that if, for
    example, an investor only learns about the misrepresentation two years and
    eleven months after it was made, the investor would have only one month not
    only to commence the action, but to obtain leave to do so. Even if a
    representative plaintiff initiates the leave motion much earlier in the
    three-year period, there is no guarantee that the motion will be completed, an
    order made, and all appeals exhausted within time. This makes the entire class action
    an uncertain endeavor.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Timminco</em>, the representative plaintiff had taken no steps to
    bring the motion for leave as the limitation period came close to expiring. The <i>Timminco</i> court observed that its decision had the desirable effect of
    ensuring that the leave motion would be proceeded with expeditiously. It
    preserved the effective three-year time limit for obtaining leave, which is
    created by the combination of the leave requirement (s. 138.3) and the three-
    year limitation for commencing the statutory action (s. 138.14). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the motion for leave must be brought in a timely manner and
    pursued diligently until leave has been granted or denied. However, I note the
    submission made in these appeals on behalf of the Ontario Securities Commission
    that the leave provision, added to prevent strike suits, came after the
    limitation period was already part of the draft legislation. In addition, the
    CSA report that recommended the leave requirement did not refer to the issue of
    timeliness or link the importance of the leave motion to the limitation period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting that the leave motion must be pursued diligently, there are a
    number of ways that can be achieved. Since class actions come under case
    management by experienced class action judges, it will be up to the judge and
    the parties to ensure timeliness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Removing from plaintiffs the ability to control compliance with the
    limitation period is another effect of the <em>Timminco</em> decision that
    undercuts the viability of the s. 138.3 action and the effectiveness of using
    the class action procedure. It could also have the indirect effect of forcing
    judges or the judicial administration to give undue priority to these
    particular actions and motions over other equally deserving litigation, in
    order to try to ensure limitation compliance.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:115%'>(3) Similar
    legislation in other provinces and Ontarios response to <em>Timminco</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Almost every province has leave, press release, and limitation period
    provisions very similar to those of the Ontario <em>Securities Act</em> in ss.
    138.8 and 138.14. The fact that the same remedy can be obtained in other
    provinces for the same misrepresentation is recognized in s. 138.14 as a factor
    that may affect the limitation period for any claimant in any of those
    provinces. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In response to the public concern about the effect of the <em>Timminco</em> decision on the efficacy of the statutory remedy, the Ontario government
    announced in its 2013 Budget, <em>A Prosperous and Fair Ontario </em>(Toronto:
    Queens Printer for Ontario, 2013), at p. 290, that it would propose updates to
    the <em>Securities Act</em> if needed, following court cases (these appeals), to
    suspend the operation of the secondary market civil liability limitation period
    while leave to proceed was being sought. The Manitoba government has already
    amended its <em>Securities Act</em>, C.C.S.M. s. S50, Part 2. Section 197(2) of
    that Act now provides that once a leave motion has been initiated in a class
    action, the limitation period is suspended. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It appears from these two legislative reactions, as well as the
    acknowledged surprise and concern in the securities bar and community,  that
    the <em>Timminco</em> decision interprets the legislation in an unintended way
    and limits the access to justice that the new remedy was intended to provide.
    This courts interpretation could also affect the interpretation and
    application of the statutory remedy in other provinces.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One could argue that the court need not reverse its own decision when
    the legislature is able to fix the statutory language and clarify its intent
    with amendments to the legislation. However, where the court is in the position
    to revisit its interpretation and is satisfied that the <i>Polowin</i> test is
    met, and especially when the courts revised interpretation could be given
    effect in other affected provinces, the better course is for the court to act.
    Otherwise, each province would have to take separate action. In <em>Polowin</em>,
    the legislature had already amended the legislation for the future, but the
    court nevertheless reversed its decision, in part in order to protect those not
    covered by the amendment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of course, it is still open to the legislature, if it so chooses, to reconsider
    the issue of commencement of a stand-alone claim for the statutory remedy, and
    to clarify at what stage of the litigation leave must be obtained. </p>
  <h2>(4) The <em>Timminco</em><i> </i>decision is very recent</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. White and Côté </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1996)</span></em>,
    29 O.R. (3d) 577, [1996] O.J. No.2405 (C.A.), the case that preceded <em>Polowin </em>in reconsidering this courts approach to <em>stare decisis</em>, one of
    the factors that the court considered important in deciding whether to overrule
    a previous precedent was how recently it had been decided. As the court stated
    at p. 605: there would be less confusion and more certainty in correcting the
    error now rather than letting it take root.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying that principle here militates in favour of setting aside the <em>Timminco</em> interpretation of s. 28 of the <i>CPA</i> on these appeals.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:115%'>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the above reasons, I would set aside the interpretation given to s.
    28 of the <em>CPA</em> in <em>Timminco</em>. I would hold that when a
    representative plaintiff in a class action brought within the <i>Securities Act</i> s. 138.14 limitation period, also pleads a cause of action based on s. 138.3 of
    the <i>Securities Act</i>, together with the facts that found that claim, and
    further pleads the intent to seek leave to commence an action under the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, then that claim has been asserted for the purpose of s. 28 of the <i>CPA</i>,
    and the limitation period is thereby suspended for all class members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The result of this conclusion is that none of the three actions under
    appeal is statute-barred. In <em>Celestica</em>, the leave motion has yet to be
    heard. In <em>Silver v. IMAX</em>, leave has been granted <em>nunc pro tunc</em>.
    Based on my proposed disposition of these appeals, the <em>nunc pro tunc</em> order is not necessary. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In <em>Green v. CIBC</em>, the leave motion was heard and
    dismissed, based on <i>Timminco</i>. The respondent in that case has raised a
    further issue with respect to the granting of leave, and the appellant appeals
    the decision of the motion judge to deny certification of the common law claim
    for negligent misrepresentation. I turn now to these additional issues.</p>
  <h1><span class=MsoPageNumber>H.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Other issues raised in </span><em>Green
    v. cibc</em></h1>
  <h2 style='line-height:115%'>(1) Did the motion
    judge err in his interpretation and application of the reasonableness test
    for granting leave</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argues that if this court finds that the s. 138.3 action
    is not statute-barred, then the motion judge erred in his conclusion that leave
    should be granted based on the evidence presented. Specifically, the
    respondents position is that the motion judge erred in his interpretation of
    the reasonable possibility of success statutory standard, and that he set the
    bar for granting leave too low when he stated that the test was intended to
    screen out cases that, even though possibly brought in good faith, are so weak
    they cannot possibly succeed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent focuses on the motion judges conclusion with respect to
    the standard to be applied on the leave test in para. 373 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I respectfully agree with van Rensburg J. and Tausenfreund J.
    that the leave requirement is a relatively low threshold. <i>It is meant to
    screen out cases that, even though possibly brought in good faith are so weak
    they cannot possibly succeed.</i> This is consistent with the purpose of the
    legislation  <i>to screen out strike suits that are plainly unmeritorious.</i> <i>It is not meant to deprive </i><em><span style='font-style:normal'>bona fide</span></em><i> litigants, with a difficult but not impossible case, from having their day in
    court.</i> This interpretation is also consistent with the philosophy of our
    legal system that contentious issues of fact and law are generally decided
    after a full hearing on the merits. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    possibility concept is very familiar because it is used for determining whether
    the pleading discloses a cause of action as required by the first part of the
    test for certification in s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>CPA</em>. As this court
    recently said in <em>Arora v. Whirlpool Canada LP, </em>2013 ONCA 657, at para.
    14:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Certification is to be denied on the
    basis that the requirement of s. 5(1)(a) is not met only &quot;if, assuming the
    facts pleaded are true, it is plain and obvious that the pleading discloses no reasonable

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The phrase reasonable prospect of success was used by
    McLachlin C.J. in <em>Knight v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd</em>, 2011 SCC 42,
    [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45 (also called <em>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd</em>.)
    where, in reference to a motion to strike a claim, the Chief Justice stated the
    test to be whether the claim has any reasonable prospect of success. She
    described its effect as weeding out the hopeless claims and ensuring that
    those that have some chance of success go to trial (para.19). Again, at para.
    20, she refers to claims that have a reasonable prospect of success and a
    reasonable chance of success.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>It is apparent that the terms prospect and chance are
    being used by the Chief Justice as synonyms, and I would include the term
    possibility as another one. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The purpose of the leave provision under Part XXIII.1 of the <em>Securities Act</em> is to discourage and eliminate bad faith strike suits
    that do not have a reasonable possibility of being successful. The statute asks
    the leave judge to first determine good faith, then whether there is a
    reasonable possibility that the action will be resolved at trial in favour of
    the plaintiff, <em>i.e.</em> that the plaintiffs case will be successful  a
    reasonable possibility of success. In order to make that determination, the
    motion judge applies the same test that is used for determining whether the
    claim has a reasonable prospect of success for the purpose of certification. As
    the Chief Justice has described it, the purpose is to weed out hopeless claims
    and only allow those to go forward that have some chance of success.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>Of course, the evidentiary record for the leave and
    certification motions is quite different. For the leave motion, each side may
    file affidavit evidence upon which there can be cross-examination. But, as has
    been pointed out by both Strathy J. and van Rensburg J., the motion is brought
    before discovery and production of documents, with the result that the evidence
    may or may not be the same at the trial. In contrast, for the certification
    motion under s. 5(1)(a), there is no evidentiary record, but the facts as
    pleaded in the statement of claim are taken to be true. In both cases, there is
    an evidentiary or deemed evidentiary record to which the test is applied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The motion judge stated that he agreed with van Rensburg J.
    (in <em>Silver v. IMAX</em>) and Tausenfreund J. (in <em>Dobbie</em> v. <em>Arctic
    Glacier Income Fund, </em>2011 ONSC 25, 3 C.P.C. (7th) 261) that the leave
    requirement is a relatively low threshold. Perell J. in <em>Zaniewicz v.
    Zungai Haixi Corp, </em>2012 ONSC 6061, at para. 37, described it as a
    preliminary low-level merits based leave test. I agree with these descriptive
    characterizations. However, beyond that, it is not necessary, in my view, to
    try to further qualify the test. As discussed above, it has been effectively
    described by McLachlin C.J. in relation to the <em>Hunt v. Carey</em> test for
    determining if a claim should be struck as disclosing no cause of action, when
    deciding whether a class action can be certified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In the securities class action context, there is also a
    significant procedural advantage to having the same test apply to the leave
    motion as to the certification motion. If the leave motion is heard before the
    certification motion and leave is denied, the claim is at an end. But if leave
    is granted, it will be unnecessary to reconsider the issue on the certification
    motion. Because the test is the same, and the evidentiary basis is the highest
    it can be for the plaintiff on the certification motion, once leave is granted
    on the record filed, the claim will also meet the cause of action criterion
    under s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>CPA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>There was considerable discussion at the oral hearing before
    this court about how quickly or expeditiously the leave motion is able to be
    heard and should be heard. Because the leave motion does not necessarily have
    to be heard and decided within the three-year limitation period when the
    statutory claim is asserted within the three-year limitation period in a class
    action, there is flexibility for the parties, together with the class action
    case management judge, to determine the best timing for the leave motion. That
    determination will also include whether it should be heard before or at the
    same time as the certification motion. The fact that the test for leave and for
    determining whether there is a cause of action is the same can shorten the
    proceedings considerably and factor into the timing decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>I am satisfied that Strathy J. applied the correct level of
    scrutiny when deciding whether leave should be granted in respect of each of
    the plaintiffs claims. At para. 374, after discussing the legislative and
    interpretive history of the leave test, he summarized the way he would approach
    the analysis as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, considering the purpose of the leave test and its
    legislative history, it would be unfair to the parties and to the court to
    expect the motion judge to engage in a finely calibrated weighing process. It seems
    to me that I should simply ask myself whether, having considered all the
    evidence adduced by the parties and having regard to the limitations of the
    motions process, the plaintiffs case is so weak or has been so successfully
    rebutted by the defendant, that it has no reasonable possibility of success.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then went on to make findings in respect of each of the plaintiffs
    claims, determining whether there was a reasonable possibility that the
    plaintiffs would establish at trial each of the impugned misrepresentations. He
    found there was a reasonable possibility for some claims but not for others.
    After dealing with the corporate responsibility, he addressed the statutory
    responsibility of each of the individual defendants. Finally, he dealt with the
    statutory defences. He applied the following test at para. 447: whether there
    is a reasonable possibility that the defendants will not be able to establish
    one or both branches of the reasonable investigation defence contained in s.
    138.4(6) of the <em>Securities Act</em>. He concluded that there was such a
    reasonable possibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, but for the conclusion he had reached with respect to the
    passing of the limitation period based on <em>Timminco</em>, the motion judge
    would have granted leave to the plaintiffs to pursue the three claims set out
    in Schedule B to these reasons.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Strathy J.s analysis was careful and detailed. He applied the test set
    out in the statutory provision for leave to the evidence before him. There is
    no basis to interfere with his conclusions.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:115%'>(2) Did the motion
    judge err by failing to certify some issues in the class action for common law
    negligent misrepresentation?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that proof of reliance is a necessary component
    of a negligent misrepresentation claim. He referred to his earlier decision in <em>McKenna
    v. Gammon Gold Inc</em>., 2010 ONSC 1591, 88 C.P.C. (6th) 27, where he
    concluded that multiple plaintiffs would not be able to prove reliance as a
    common issue in a claim for negligent misrepresentation in either the primary
    or secondary markets, and that such claims were therefore fundamentally
    unsuitable for certification (paras. 159-161). He then noted that the Supreme
    Court of Canada had recently reaffirmed the need to establish reliance in
    negligent misrepresentation claims in <em>Sharbern Holding Inc. v. Vancouver
    Airport Centre</em> <em>Ltd.</em>, 2011 SCC 23, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 175. Finally,
    he rejected the submission that fraud on the market or the efficient market
    theory could replace the need to prove individual reliance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants challenge these findings on two grounds. First, they say
    that the motion judge failed to consider whether certifying some of the issues
    that were common within the negligent misrepresentation claims would
    significantly advance the litigation; they submit that he erred in restricting
    his analysis solely to the common issue of reliance. Second, they argue that he
    should have certified the issue of inferred common reliance based on the fraud
    on the market or efficient market economic theories.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to the second ground. However, I agree with the
    appellants that certifying issues other than reliance that are common to the
    negligent misrepresentation claims would significantly advance those claims. For
    example, there may be investors who are entitled to a very large recovery
    beyond the capped amount allowed by the statutory claim. Those investors could
    use the findings on the common issues in order to advance their individual
    claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    first with whether the issue of reliance should be certified, in other cases of
    negligent misrepresentation, such as Strathy J.s recent decision in <em>Cannon
    v. Funds for Canada Foundation,</em> 2012 ONSC 3009, 218 A.C.W.S. (3d) 264, the
    facts allowed the court to certify certain common issues, including inferred
    reliance. In that case, investors had invested in a tax shelter which was
    promoted, in part, based on an opinion letter and a comfort letter from a
    defendant lawyer. Strathy J. was prepared to certify common issues relating to
    reliance on the basis that there were only two documents investors looked at,
    and the entire tax shelter was premised on those documents being true. In those
    circumstances, inferred group reliance could be certified as a common issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Green v. CIBC</em>, Strathy J. concluded that the issues of individual
    reliance were not suitable for certification on any basis. Nor could the issues
    of individual reliance be supplanted by an inference of group reliance in the
    secondary market context. He supported that conclusion by observing that there
    was no authority for the use of the fraud on the market theory to supplant
    the inquiry into individual reliance in the secondary market context.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Strathy J. also based his decision on the fact that the introduction of the
    statutory remedy for secondary market misrepresentation under s. 138.3 of the <em>Securities
    Act</em> was enacted, in part, due to the difficulty in proving reliance-based
    common law claims and the rejection in Ontario of the fraud on the market
    theory (para. 595). The remedy includes provisions that prevent abuse and
    protect continuing shareholders from damaging exposure to such claims. He
    observed that to allow common law claims where the corporate and shareholder
    protections are not available would render the new remedy and the protective
    leave process redundant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in the motion judges analysis and no basis to interfere with his
    conclusion that the reliance issues should not be certified. However, if the
    motion judge intended to say that no issues in the entire common law
    misrepresentation claim can be certified alongside the statutory claim, that
    suggestion conflicts with s. 138.13 of the <em>Securities Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> which provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The right of action for damages and the defences to an action
    under s. 138.3 are in addition to, and without derogation from, any other
    rights or defences the plaintiff or defendant may have in an action brought
    otherwise than under this Part.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first five proposed common issues identified by the plaintiffs refer to the
    conduct and intent of the defendant CIBC.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> (There is no appeal on this ground as against the individual defendants.) I see
    no reason why those issues cannot and should not be certified as against CIBC
    in order to advance the litigation. See <em>Cloud v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>,
    [2004] O.J. No. 4924, 73 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 52. The trial judge may order
    individual trials to determine the issues of reliance and damages in accordance
    with s. 25 of the <i>CPA</i>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore allow the appeal in respect of those issues and allow them to
    be certified.</p>
  <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, in <em>Green v. CIBC</em>, I would allow the appeal to the extent
    that the order dismissing the class action as statute-barred would be set aside
    and the common issues in the common law claim relating to the conduct and intent
    of the defendant CIBC set out in Schedule B to these reasons would be
    certified. The finding of the motion judge that would have granted leave to
    commence the statutory action in respect of the common issues that he would
    have certified, also set out in Schedule B, plus the denial of certification
    of common issues relating to the issue of reliance in the common law claim would
    be confirmed. </p>
