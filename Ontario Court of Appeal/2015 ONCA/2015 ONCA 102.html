  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Celine Dostaler, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard: February 2, 2015</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the acquittals entered on December 18,
    2013, by Justice Timothy D. Ray of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without
    a jury.</p>
  <p class=Heading>By the Court:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals from the acquittals of the respondent on a number of
    charges including sexual assault, possession of a weapon, two counts of
    unlawful confinement, and assault. While acquitting the respondent of sexual
    assault on his wife, the trial judge found him guilty of the included offence
    of simple assault. The respondent also pled guilty to two breaches of
    recognizance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before sentencing on the convictions, the trial judge declared a
    mistrial based on a reasonable apprehension of bias that arose out of a meeting
    that he had in his chambers with the officer in charge of the case immediately after
    he delivered the reasons for his verdicts. The following are the circumstances
    that caused the trial judge to declare a mistrial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After seeking further input from counsel on the issue of included
    offences, the trial judge retired before giving his decision. During the break,
    the trial judge sent a message to the officer in charge that he would like to
    see her in his chambers after he had delivered his reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When she arrived, the trial judge told her that the reason he had called
    her into chambers was to ask if she had gone onto the website “Match.com.” The
    evidence at trial had been that the complainant and the respondent had met on
    Match.com and that during the alleged sexual assault encounter, the respondent had
    become angry and searched that website to see the complainant’s other contacts
    there.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge told the officer that he had gone onto the website the
    night before and created a fake profile of himself. He said that had defense
    counsel done the same thing, she “would have been able to hang the victim with
    all of the available information,” because a large amount of information is
    entered including how many drinks a desired partner should consume. They also
    discussed the evidence in the case and the witnesses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officer reported the conversation to the Crown Attorney and
    eventually provided a written statement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown sought to appeal the acquittals and moved before the trial
    judge for a mistrial on the convictions. The trial judge made a statement at
    the opening of the mistrial application including: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The only information I had at the time I gave my decision on
    December 18th, 2013 was the evidence heard in court and reviewed in my
    decision.  I finished my written decision, left the office, and while at home
    during the evening went online out of curiosity about the Match.com website
    which had been mentioned in evidence.  After signing in, using an anonymous
    user name, I was faced with a great number of very personal questions.  I then
    logged out.  I did not conduct any research about the complainant, and no
    information about the complainant was made available to me.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>My conversation with Detective Lehman about the website was
    based on the type and extent to [sic] the questions I found from my brief log
    in the previous evening after I had written my decision, and that any person
    using the website is required to disclose a great deal of personal
    information.  My point was, if this type of information could be accessed, it
    might be useful as a potential investigative tool and for counsel in a criminal
    trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In granting the mistrial, the trial judge added: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Notwithstanding what I have said, my off the record
    conversation with Detective Lehman in the absence of counsel was clearly an
    error in judgment on my part and is the basis of the Crown’s argument of
    perceived apprehension of bias on my part.  The Crown made it clear that it is
    not their case that I am or was biased, but that there is an appearance of
    bias.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While I am <em>functus officio</em> with respect to those
    counts on which I entered an acquittal, I am not <em>functus</em> with respect
    to the charges on which I entered guilty verdicts until I have imposed
    sentence.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Where there are exceptional circumstances and where clearly
    called for, a trial judge may vacate the adjudication of guilt at any time
    before a sentence is imposed.  <em>R. v. Griffiths</em>, 2013 ONCA 510, and <em>R.
    v. Lessard</em>, 1977, 30 C.C.C. (2<sup>nd</sup>) 70.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While I feel confident I can disabuse myself of any out of
    court evidence concerning C.D.H. that I received during the conversation with
    Detective Lehman, the appearance of fairness may very well have been affected. 
    I am persuaded that my conversation with Detective Lehman about the evidence in
    this case after I gave my decision taints the perceived fairness of the
    process, and is an exceptional circumstance requiring a mistrial.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Similarly, I am concerned that the tainting of the perceived
    fairness of the process cannot be cured by my recusal in favour of another
    judge to complete the penalty phase.  As a consequence, I am not prepared to
    exercise my discretion in favour of recusing myself pursuant to section 669.2
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Accordingly, the Crown’s application is granted, a mistrial is
    ordered, and the findings of guilt made by me on December 18, 2013 are vacated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Crown raises a number of grounds of
    appeal that arise from the reasons for judgment, including errors with respect
    to the trial judge’s approach to the credibility of the complainant. However, it
    is unnecessary to deal with these other grounds. The outcome of the appeal
    turns on the issue of reasonable apprehension of bias.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>On that ground alone, we are satisfied
    that the circumstances we have outlined gave rise to a reasonable apprehension
    of bias. The acquittals must be set aside and a new trial ordered.  Two
    considerations support this conclusion.  1) In declaring a mistrial, the trial
    judge himself recognized that the verdicts were tainted by reasonable
    apprehension of bias; and 2) The conduct of the trial judge in conducting his
    own evidentiary research while the decision was under reserve - whether or not
    he had already written his reasons or he accessed any actual details about the
    complainant - and his comment to the officer about using the website
    information to “hang” the complainant, created the appearance of bias.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The long-accepted test for reasonable
    apprehension of bias was set out by de Grandpré J. in </span><em>Committee for
    Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National Energy Board)</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at p. 394 as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>[T]he apprehension of bias must be a
    reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying
    themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. …
    [The] test is “what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically
    and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude.  Would he
    think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether
    consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Furthermore, as this court recently
    observed in </span><em>Hazelton Lanes Inc. v. 1707590 Ontario Limited</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2014 ONCA 793, at para. 60, “in order to maintain public
    confidence in the administration of justice, the appearance of judicial
    impartiality is as important as the reality.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>As just noted, the trial judge himself
    acknowledged the appearance of bias and that his conversation with the officer
    about the evidence “taints the perceived fairness of the process.” His
    reference to being </span><em>functus officio</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> with regard to the acquittals but not the convictions indicates that had he not
    been </span><em>functus</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, he would have declared
    a mistrial on all of the charges.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>We agree that the conduct of the trial
    judge created a reasonable apprehension of bias. He conducted his own research
    into a website that had been the subject of evidence at trial while his
    decision was under reserve, contrary to the basic principle that judges and
    jurors must make their judicial decisions based only on the evidence presented
    in court on the record. Jurors are specifically told not to conduct any Internet
    searches about anything in the case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>His comment to the officer about the
    information that defence counsel could have obtained on the website to “hang”
    the complainant may have an innocent explanation, but viewed objectively, from
    the standpoint of a reasonable person, the comment creates the impression that,
    consciously or unconsciously, the trial judge would not decide fairly, and in
    particular would not fairly decide the credibility of the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>One would not be disabused of this
    impression by the negative comments made by the trial judge about the
    complainant and her credibility in his reasons for judgment. We cite three
    examples.  First, contrary to the prohibitions contained in s. 486.1(6) and
    486.2(8) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46, the trial judge commented negatively about the complainant’s having
    testified with a support person and behind a screen. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Second, the trial judge used irrelevant
    stereotypes to judge the complainant and make adverse findings against her.  In
    the following passage, he said: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>Her manner bordered on being rude. 
    Yet when she wanted to, she was feisty and debated with the defence counsel. 
    She certainly </span>did not give me the impression that she was in any way an
    abused woman or that she was insecure.  Her job as a personal trainer visiting
    customers in their homes suggests that she is likely an independent minded
    person.<span class=MsoPageNumber>  While watching WR give her evidence it
    crossed my mind that perhaps she was using the screen and support worker as </span>props
    to further attempt to engage sympathy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Third, after noting that the respondent
    had looked on Match.com to see what liaisons the complainant had there, the
    trial judge concluded that the respondent’s anger at the complainant was
    understandable when he saw her emails with other men.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber>Conclusion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conduct of the trial judge while his decision was under reserve as well as his
    statements to the officer about that conduct were improper and created a
    reasonable apprehension of bias and lack of impartiality.  This apprehension of
    bias taints the verdicts of acquittal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is allowed, the verdicts of acquittal are set aside and a new trial is
    ordered on those charges.</p>
