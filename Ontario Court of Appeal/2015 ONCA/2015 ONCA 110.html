lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant Andrea Iannarella was rear-ended
    by the respondent Stephen Corbett. He and his wife, Giuseppina, sued for
    damages for his personal injuries. The jury found Mr. Corbett had not been
    driving negligently and the action was dismissed on liability grounds. Had
    liability been established, the jury would have awarded general damages of
    $32,000 and $40,571 as damages for past income loss, but would not have awarded
    damages for future income loss. The trial judge dismissed Mr. Iannarella’s
    claim for non-pecuniary damages on the basis that the statutory “threshold” for
    this type of recovery under s. 267.5 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990
    c. I.8, was not met. He awarded the respondents costs of about $255,000 for a fifteen-day
    trial that extended over four weeks.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons set out below, </span>I would <span
lang=EN-US>set aside the judgment and substitute a finding of liability against
    the respondents. In relation to damages, a series of rulings resulted in a
    trial by ambush, contrary to the letter and the spirit of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Rules of Civil Procedure</span></em><span lang=EN-US>. I would order
    a new trial on the issues of damages</span><span lang=EN-US>.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The accident happened on a snowy February
    evening. It was stop and go traffic on Highway 427. Mr. Iannarella testified
    that it was starting to get dark, there was some snowfall, and wetness could
    have made the roads slippery. He testified that although it was stop and go
    traffic, he was able to slow and stop his pick-up truck before he was struck
    from behind.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Corbett testified that he was driving behind
    Mr. Iannarella in his concrete mixer (which weighed about 12 tonnes empty) in
    low gear, and that “[i]t was snowy, dark and the roads were icy.” Visibility
    was “in and out” and there were “little whiteouts” in “bumper to bumper”
    traffic. He was accelerating and was about to shift into second gear when a
    snowsquall, which he described as a “whiteout”, suddenly reduced his visibility
    to zero. He testified that at that point he had only two options: to brake or
    to keep going. After a delay of “one-and-a-half seconds”, he “slammed” on his
    brakes “fairly hard”. Despite traveling at an initial speed of at most eight kilometers
    per hour, his vehicle did not stop before sliding into the rear of Mr.
    Iannarella’s pick-up truck. Mr. Corbett was adamant that there was nothing
    further he could have done to avoid the collision and repeatedly said that the
    accident was caused by “mother nature”. He told Mr. Iannarella at the scene:
    “Sorry, but I don’t control mother nature.”</span></p>

    cuff injury to his left shoulder in the accident. He has since had two

    ask this court to grant them judgment on this issue and to substitute a finding
    of liability. I consider the law on the onus of proof, the trial judge’s
    treatment of the onus, and the jury charge on liability.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In charging a jury regarding the onus of proof for rear-end motor
    vehicle collisions, <span lang=EN-US>trial judges often use a variation of the
    standard liability instruction from O’Brien’s Jury Charges (1998), which
    provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>A prudent motorist should drive at such rate of speed with his
    vehicle under such control that he is able to pull up within the range of his
    vision. If there is any difficulty in seeing because of weather conditions,
    then common sense dictates that he should travel more slowly. In other words,
    &quot;if you can't see where you're going don't go&quot;. If the road is icy or
    slippery, then even more care should be taken. In a case where a vehicle is
    struck without the driver of the rear vehicle having seen it until it was too
    late to avoid a collision, then you should ask yourselves; (1) Was he keeping a
    proper lookout? (2) If he was keeping the best lookout possible, was he going
    too fast for the lookout that could be kept in the circumstances?&quot;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Members of the jury, generally speaking, when
    one car runs into another from behind, in the absence of any excuse for such a
    collision, the driver of the rear car must satisfy you that the collision did
    not occur as a result of his negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This jury instruction places the onus on the
    defendant to prove that he could not have avoided the accident by the exercise
    of reasonable care. As the annotation to the standard jury charge observes, a
    driver must stay a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead, keep a lookout and
    maintain a reasonable speed, so that he or she has sufficient time to stop if
    the vehicle ahead suddenly stops. These requirements reflect long-established
    basic principles: see <em>Toronto v. Waite</em>, [1954] O.J. No. 404 (H.C.J.); <em>Whiddon
    v. Wickstrom</em>, [1948] O.J. No. 76 (C.A.); <em>DeCourcey v.</em><i> <em>London
    Street Railway</em></i>, [1932] O.R. 226 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>Beaumont v. Ruddy</em>, [1932] O.R. 441
    (C.A.), at p. 442, this court explained the onus applicable to rear-end motor
    vehicle collisions: “Generally speaking, when one car runs into another from
    behind, the fault is in the driving of the rear car, and the driver of the rear
    car must satisfy the court that the collision did not occur as a result of his
    negligence.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This principle was confirmed</span> in <em><span
lang=EN-US>Graham v. Hodgkinson</span></em><span lang=EN-US> (1983), 40 O.R.
    (2d) 697 (C.A.), where the plaintiff was rear-ended by the defendant. This
    court set aside the jury verdict and substituted a finding of liability where
    the jury was not properly instructed about the defendant’s onus. The court
    held:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>A defendant thus may be called upon to establish that he could
    not have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care in certain
    situations, for example, where he collides with the plaintiff's car on the
    plaintiff's side of the highway or where, as in this case, he runs into the
    rear of the plaintiff's car. (Para. 22)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>Graham</em>,<i> </i>the court relied on the
    British Columbia Court of Appeal’s analysis in <em>Hackman v. Vecchio</em>, (1969),
    4 D.L.R. (3d) 444 (B.C. C.A.). At para.&nbsp;11 of <em>Hackman</em>, the court observed
    that in icy conditions the defendant is “obliged to show that he did not expect
    ice at that point, and that he had no reason to expect it, for if he ought to
    have foreseen it, he was bound to drive slowly enough to avoid skidding upon
    it.” The appellants rely especially on the British Columbia Court of Appeal’s conclusion,
    at para. 13, that “[o]n the respondent's own evidence it was impossible for a
    jury to come reasonably to the conclusion that he was taken by surprise by ice
    at the point where he skidded, because he speaks of the road throughout being
    slippery and icy.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court recently addressed the onus issue in <em>Martin-Vandenhende
    v. Myslik</em>, 2012 ONCA 53. Justice Blair noted, at para. 31, that the common
    law principle from <em>Beaumont</em><i> </i>does not automatically lead to
    liability for the driver who is following behind. Instead, “[i]t simply states
    that <em>generally</em><i> speaking</i> this will be the case, and shifts the
    onus to the following driver to show otherwise.” </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><span style='line-height:200%'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Trial Judge’s Treatment of the
    Onus</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a rear-end motor vehicle collision, such as
    the one at issue in this case, the onus is on the defendant to prove that he or
    she could not have avoided the accident through the exercise of reasonable care.
    This led the appellants’ trial counsel to move for a directed verdict on
    liability, which the trial judge refused. In argument on the motion, the
    appellants’ trial counsel argued that the onus was on the respondents to prove the
    collision was an inevitable accident. Mr. Forget, counsel for the respondents, correctly
    pointed out that the expression “inevitable accident” simply denotes a defendant’s
    “lack of negligence”. This understanding flows directly from this court’s
    discussion in <em>Graham</em>, and the onus of establishing the absence of
    negligence remains on the defendant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, the trial judge took a different tack,
    stating that the defence applicable in this case was not one of inevitable
    accident. Instead, he characterized the accident at issue as “nearer an
    emergent situation than an inevitable accident situation.” He went on to explain
    his position in his ruling:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the case of an inevitable accident, clearly the onus is on
    the defendant to establish on credible evidence the inevitability. In an
    emergency situation, <u>the onus is on the plaintiff to establish the emergency
    and to establish that there’s no negligence on the part of the defendant
    leading to the emergency</u>, or until the emergency occurs. Then the law
    changes and the defendant is burdened not with perfection but with doing the
    best that a reasonable operator of a motor vehicle could be expected to do in
    the emergent situation. That’s different from inevitable accident, but it still
    puts a burden onto the defendant to put before the jury sufficient facts to
    establish that the emergency situation was not of his making and that he could
    not have avoided it and that’s where the argument is going to fall. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge appears to have misspoken
    when he used the underlined words. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><span style='line-height:200%'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Jury Charge on Liability</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The jury charge relating to negligence and
    liability extended over 13 transcript pages. The trial judge told the jury that
    “the plaintiff has the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities all
    of the facts necessary to prove the following issues, that he was injured and
    that the negligence of the defendant driver was the effective cause of his injuries.”
    He pointed to the burden on the appellants multiple times. He also explained
    the law concerning an emergency situation in a manner consistent with his
    ruling on the directed verdict, summarized in the preceding paragraph. The
    trial judge referred to the section of the <em>Highway Traffic</em><i> Act</i>,

    trial judge to have departed from the principle expressed in the standard jury
    charge, which is consistent with the established jurisprudence. To repeat, the
    standard charge provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Members of the jury, generally speaking, when one car runs into
    another from behind, in the absence of any excuse for such a collision, the
    driver of the rear car must satisfy you that the collision did not occur as a
    result of his negligence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would make one minor change to the wording of
    the standard charge: the phrase “in the absence of any excuse for such a
    collision” should be deleted. In my view, the driver of the rear vehicle might
    well have an excuse for the collision that satisfies the jury that the accident
    did not occur as a result of his or her negligence. Nonetheless, the duty to
    provide that explanation rests on the defendant, not the plaintiff. To put it
    differently, once the plaintiff has proven that a rear-end collision occurred,
    the evidentiary burden shifts from the plaintiff to the defendant, who must then
    show that he or she was not negligent. This analysis would apply even where an
    emergency situation is alleged, as in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not provide an instruction
    resembling the standard instruction and did not advert to the shift in onus in
    his jury charge. Instead, he emphasized throughout the charge that the onus was
    on the appellants. With respect, the trial judge’s statement that “[t]he onus
    of establishing an emergency situation, and in measuring his conduct within it,
    isn’t onus upon the defendant”, is simply incorrect.</span></p>

    the appellants did not object to this element of the charge at trial and submit
    that the appeal on this issue should be dismissed on this basis. They point to
    the following comment by</span><span lang=EN-US> Finlayson&nbsp;J.A. in </span><em><span

lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this submission. Trial counsel made his
    position on the onus plain to the trial judge in the motion for a directed

    law on the onus of proof, the failure to object has no relevance.</span></p>

lang=EN-US> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 722 (C.A.), at para 68. Another way to express
    this test is in the terms of s. 134(6) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    that the appellant must “show that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of
    justice has occurred.” (</span><em><span lang=EN-US>Vokes Estate v. Palmer</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2012 ONCA 510, at para. 7) The respondents argue that the test is
    not met since the jury</span><span lang=EN-US> “clearly accepted that Mr.

    that Mr. Corbett had not acted negligently regardless of the onus</span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this submission. The respondents
    had ample opportunity at trial to put forward their best foot on the liability
    issue. </span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the respondents’ explanation falls
    short of establishing that there was no negligence on Mr. Corbett’s part. His
    evidence fails to prove that he could not have avoided the accident by the
    exercise of reasonable skill or care. The road and weather conditions at the
    time called for a higher level of vigilance by all drivers. Mr. Iannarella was
    able to stop his vehicle without incident, as were other drivers. Mr. Corbett
    was accelerating when he lost visibility, but rather than immediately braking
    gently, he hesitated; he then slammed on the brakes. He broke traction and slid
    into Mr. Iannarella’s vehicle. Mr. Corbett was plainly going too fast for the
    weather and road conditions and could have avoided the collision accident by
    exercising sufficient care.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The choice is between a new trial on liability
    and finding the defendants liable. We are justified in finding the defendants
    liable because, even accepting Mr. Corbett’s evidence, he failed to disprove
    his negligence.</span><span lang=EN-US> Given the circumstances and the law
    applicable to rear-end motor vehicle collisions, a new trial on liability is unnecessary.

  <p class=CQuote>The question before the trial judge concerned only the

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That comfort is misplaced. The issue for the
    court in <em>Landolfi </em>was whether the defendant should be obliged to
    produce all of the video surveillance for review by the plaintiff. This court
    ruled that full production was not required when the video was only to be used
    for impeachment. In making the emphasized comment, Cronk J.A. was hearkening
    back to her earlier statements at paras. 70-72 of <em>Landolfi</em>, where she
    noted that if the plaintiff was not content with the quality of the particulars
    already provided by the defence, he should have brought a motion for further
    and better particulars or for additional oral discovery before trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The radical difference between this case and <em>Landolfi</em> is that the defendant in <em>Landolfi</em> had provided extensive particulars
    of the surveillance to the plaintiff, including the date, time and place of the
    videos, as well as the nature and duration of the activities depicted. None of
    this information was provided to the appellants in this case, despite repeated
    requests by the appellants’ counsel, and it should have been. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s implicit reliance on rule
    48.04 as the authority for refusing to make the order requested by the appellants
    because they had set the action down for trial was misplaced. Unlike rule
    31.03(1), which provides that a party “may” conduct an examination for
    discovery, rule 30.03(1) provides that a party <em>shall</em> serve an
    affidavit of documents. The obligation to provide an affidavit of documents, which
    includes listing privileged surveillance in the accompanying Schedule B, is
    mandatory. This is the way in which a claim to privilege is to be asserted for
    the purpose of rule 30.09. Further, rule 48.04(1) specifically provides that
    even after a matter is set down for trial, a party is not relieved from its
    obligation under rule 30.07 to disclose documents subsequently discovered or
    that were not previously disclosed in an affidavit of documents, although rule
    48.04 (2)(b)(ii) assumes that an affidavit had previously been delivered in
    compliance with the <i>Rules</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am alert to the Supreme Court of Canada’s call
    for a civil litigation “culture shift” to make the conventional trial process more
    timely and affordable, and the waiver of a party’s strict rights can play an
    important role in expediting cases. (<em>Hryniak v. Mauldin</em>, 2014 SCC 7, [2014]
    1 S.C.R. 87, at para. 2) I do not suggest that a party cannot waive discovery. Discovery
    is often waived in rear-end motor vehicle collisions because the defendant’s
    liability is not disputed; where damages are the real issue, the individual defendant
    typically has nothing to provide by way of evidence. I also do not suggest that
    the requirement for an affidavit of documents cannot be waived. There may be
    simple cases where that makes good economic sense. However, an effective waiver
    should be express, rather than implied solely from the fact that the matter was
    set down for trial, as appears to have happened in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii) Subsequent
    Surveillance Must be Disclosed</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted, it is clear that if surveillance
    occurs before the affidavit of documents is served, the surveillance report must
    be listed in the affidavit and requests for particulars must be answered at
    examination for discovery. In his helpful article titled “Use of Surveillance
    at Trial” (<em>Ontario Bar Association</em><i> <em>Insurance Law Newsletter</em></i>,
    Vol. 18, No. 1 (2007)), Brian M. Bangay observed, at p. 2, that “it appears
    well settled that a condition precedent to the use of surveillance material at
    trial is disclosure.” However, the respondents dispute the application of these
    disclosure obligations to surveillance conducted after the affidavit of
    documents is served, particularly where, as here, no affidavit was served.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, a party is obliged by a combination
    of rules 30.06 and 30.07(b) to provide an updated affidavit of documents
    listing the new surveillance. Further, the party must disclose the particulars of
    this subsequent surveillance upon request under rule 31.09(1)(b). These
    disclosure obligations are fundamental and extend to surveillance obtained
    after the original affidavit of documents is served. In short, rule 30.07
    offers the respondents no escape route from the obligation to disclose the
    existence of surveillance. In my view, rules 30.03 and 30.07 apply even where,
    as here, the party fails to serve an affidavit of documents, despite the
    opening words of rule 30.07 that the rule applies “[w]here a party, after
    serving an affidavit of documents”, because the rule assumes that the party has
    complied with rule 30.03 and has served an affidavit. The court should not
    reward non-compliance.</span></p>

    Howden J. relied on rule 30.07(b) to find at para. 49, that the conduct of
    subsequent surveillance rendered the existing affidavit of documents
    “incomplete and inaccurate”. He concluded that “the defendants were required to
    serve a supplementary affidavit disclosing the additional document, i.e. the
    surveillance record, in a timely manner before trial.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    ONSC 5318, Chappel J. ordered the defendant to provide a sworn affidavit of
    documents – and attend at cross-examination on the affidavit if requested –
    disclosing the existence of subsequent surveillance. The defendant in that case
    had only provided a draft affidavit of documents. See also <em>Arsenault-Armstrong</em>. </span></p>

lang=EN-US> </span>The Right to Further Discovery</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rule 48.04(1) provides that a party who has set
    a matter down for trial “shall not initiate or continue any motion or form of
    discovery without leave of the court.” Rule 48.04(2) sets out some exceptions.
    One is rule 31.09, which provides that a party must correct an incorrect or incomplete
    answer given on discovery and can be subject to further examination for
    discovery on request by an adverse party. Another exception to rule 48.04 is rule
    30.07. It does not expressly provide for further examination for discovery.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, as the case law demonstrates, and as
    practitioners well know, there are routes that an aggrieved party can take to
    obtain disclosure of relevant information when a supplementary affidavit is
    served, even after a matter is set down for trial. Motions are brought as a
    last resort against intransigence, and are frequently settled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It may be appropriate for a court to grant leave
    for the adverse party to cross-examine on the newly disclosed information. The
    defendants in <em>Cromb</em> served a draft affidavit of documents and assured
    the plaintiffs a sworn version was forthcoming. No sworn affidavit of documents
    had been served by the time the matter was listed for trial. Justice Chappel found,
    at para. 22, that the plaintiffs’ motion to order the defendants to serve a
    sworn affidavit of documents did not “fall squarely within the exceptions to
    the leave requirement set out in Rule 48.04(2)(b).” She ordered the defendants
    to serve a sworn affidavit.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Justice Chappel concluded that leave to
    cross-examine the defendants on the affidavit of documents under rule 30.06 was
    necessary since this relief did not fall within any of the exceptions listed in
    rule 48.04(2). She stated that refusing leave would be “manifestly unjust”
    because the subsequent surveillance constituted a change in circumstances (paras.
    33, 38-39).</span></p>

    cross-examination to address a supplementary affidavit of documents is
    consistent with the underlying objectives of the discovery rules generally and of
    rule 30.07 in particular. To conclude otherwise would invite the type of
    tactics this court condemned in <em>Ceci</em>, at para 9:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he discovery rules must be read in a manner to discourage

    failing to disclose surveillance conducted after the matter was set down for
    trial in an affidavit of documents; and, inferentially, rule 31.09 obliging the
    respondents to correct answers given on an undertaking ultimately leading to
    the provision of surveillance particulars. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents would have served an affidavit
    of documents disclosing the existence of any surveillance, as well as a
    supplementary affidavit of documents listing any surveillance that was subsequently
    carried out. The inclusion of the surveillance report in Schedule B of the
    affidavit would likely have prompted the appellants to seek particulars on examination
    for discovery, instead of waiving this right. With the surveillance particulars
    in hand, the appellants would have been in a position to properly evaluate the
    settlement proffered by the respondents. The appellants might well have
    provided the particulars of the surveillance to experts for consideration in
    the formulation of their opinions. Had the matter still proceeded to trial, the
    appellants’ counsel would have been in a position to better plan Mr.&nbsp;Iannarella’s
    examination-in-chief in order to address the surveillance evidence. The
    entirety of this important pre-trial process was effectively foregone.</span></p>

    documents disclosing the surveillance or at least to disclose such particulars as
    are ordinarily provided through a discovery undertaking. He should have offered
    the appellants an adjournment of the trial, and dealt with the issue of costs thrown
    away, since the appellants were not without fault. This would have permitted
    the appellants to access at least some of the advantages of disclosure. Even a
    relatively short adjournment to permit counsel to plan Mr. Iannarella’s examination-in-chief
    in light of the surveillance particulars would have been appropriate, in the
    event that the appellants did not want a lengthy adjournment. None of this was offered.</span></p>

    in good trial practice by appellants’ trial counsel (not Mr. Zuber), by failing
    to pursue the appellants’ entitlements at an earlier stage. However, the weight

    a document”. But rule 30.03 requires a party’s assertion of privilege to be

    C.P.C. (2d) 281 (H.C.J.), the plaintiff stated at examination for discovery that
    although his neck bothered him, he was still able to engage in recreational and
    sporting activities. At trial, he unexpectedly testified that his pain had
    increased to the point that he could no longer participate in any of these
    activities and had trouble lifting. Justice Campbell noted that rule 31.09(1) required
    the plaintiff to update his answers to the discovery questions about his pain
    levels and functional abilities. Because he failed to do so until the middle of
    trial, Campbell J. excluded the new evidence, explaining at paras. 24-25, that: </span></p>

    obligation to update discovery answers had the goals of creating “some
    incentive to the plaintiff to disclose a change in the evidence”, discouraging “trial
    by ambush” and promoting “the objects of discovery which include the
    encouragement of settlement, the narrowing of issues, and the basic rule of
    fairness that a party should have reasonable knowledge of the case he must meet”.
    As noted above, these goals and objects were defeated in the case at hand by
    the tactics of the respondents. The trial judge erred by not considering or
    recognizing how this prejudiced the appellants.  </span></p>

    admitted at trial as substantive evidence. Alternatively, she sought to use the
    surveillance to impeach the plaintiff’s testimony at trial. Justice Gilmore
    refused leave to use the surveillance as substantive evidence but permitted it
    to be used for impeachment. The plaintiffs in <em>Smith</em><i> </i>had the
    opportunity to view the surveillance videos before they were used for
    impeachment. This was an important factor in Gilmore J.’s conclusion, at para.
    30, that the prejudicial effect of the surveillance did not outweigh its
    probative value. Further, Gilmore J. offered the plaintiff an adjournment.

    “breached, though not totally, the rule in <em>Browne v. Dunn</em>”. Although
    counsel put the activities depicted in the videos to the plaintiff, he noted
    that this was done in a “very generalized and superficial way.” Justice Ewaschuk
    held, at para. 14, that it was “at least incumbent ... to put to the witness

    (3d) 277 (S.C.),</span></em><i> </i>as a relevant example. In <em>Ferenczy</em>,
    the plaintiff testified that she could not hold a cup in her left hand, but the
    surveillance clearly demonstrated that her claim was false. Justice Dawson
    permitted the surveillance evidence to be used to impeach the plaintiff in

    must be such that it is capable of contradicting, challenging or impugning” the
    witness’ testimony. In a <em>voir dire</em>, Bryant J. obliged the defendant to
    identify with specificity which inconsistencies or contradictions in the
    plaintiff’s testimony the surveillance would be used to impeach. He then
    analyzed each alleged inconsistency and ultimately concluded that the surveillance

lang=EN-US>Defence counsel made strenuous efforts over many hours to get a
    categorical statement from Mr. Iannarella about the functionality of his left
    arm. He was not clearly successful, which meant that each portion of the video
    excerpts had to be individually assessed. But counsel did not elicit from Mr.&nbsp;Iannarella
    the precise testimony as to his functionality that each surveillance extract
    would contradict, nor did he put an explicit and detailed formulation of a <em>Browne
    v. Dunn</em> challenge to him in respect of each incident depicted in the
    surveillance. More importantly, the trial judge erred by failing to determine
    whether the surveillance was relevant to Mr. Iannarella’s credibility before
    admitting it into evidence, through the detailed analysis similar to Bryant J.
    in <em>Lis</em>. Instead, the trial judge permitted defence counsel to simply
    play the surveillance footage. This was an inadequate foundation for
    impeachment under rule 30.09 and worked unfairly to the prejudice of the appellants.</span></p>

    perfunctory and technical, as one would expect. Counsel argued, however, that by
    requiring the videographers to testify, the appellants “opened the door” and he
    was then able to examine them on their observations of Mr. Iannarella’s
    functionality. This led to the following exchange with one videographer:</span></p>

    Plaintiff’s physical capacities. It has a limited purpose. It is to be used by
    you, the judges of the facts, to assess the Plaintiff’s credibility as to his physical
    limitations following the accident. To repeat, you cannot use what you saw on
    the video to determine his physical capacities. You can only use what you saw

lang=EN-US>The trial judge then ruled that if Dr. Soon-Shiong was to be called
    as a witness, his report should not be in Exhibit 1. He was prepared to permit counsel
    to read from the factual portions of Dr. Soon-Shiong’s report as a lead in to
    questions, but only “the parts of the interchange between Dr. Soon-Shiong and Mr.
    Iannarella”, and not the doctor’s opinion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>After the lunch break, counsel resumed cross-examining Mr.
    Iannarella and again projected Dr. Soon-Shiong’s report. Mr. Villeneuve again objected
    that it was unfair for counsel to put only selected bits of Dr. Soon-Shiong’s
    evidence to the witness. The trial judge allowed respondents’ counsel to continue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Villeneuve later objected to the continuation of what he called
    the “slide show” on the basis that counsel was departing from the factual
    details in Dr.&nbsp;Soon-Shiong’s report and venturing into the doctor’s
    examination and opinion. Counsel responded that the Exhibit containing the
    report had gone in on consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>After more skirmishing, respondents’ counsel said that he would stop
    projecting the report. The trial judge concurred, and noted that it would be preferable
    not to project additional reports so that “whatever is on the written page
    above and below the proposition that you are focusing on won’t be apparent to
    the jury.” He also noted that “[t]he difficulty always is that when doctors
    attend and give evidence from their reports, almost always, the reports do not
    complete the entirety of their evidence”. Counsel then proceeded in the
    conventional way asking questions about Mr. Iannarella’s visit to the doctor
    without projecting the report excerpts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Respondents’ counsel was about to project a report from a
    physiotherapist when Mr.&nbsp;Villeneuve again objected. The trial judge noted
    that a physiotherapist is not a doctor and that his direction not to project
    doctors’ reports did not apply to her. The physiotherapist’s report was
    projected before the jury. The trial judge noted that he would later decide
    whether the physiotherapist’s report would remain in Exhibit 1 and go to the
    jury room for deliberations. (I observe that reports from doctors and
    physiotherapists fall within s. 52 of the <em>Evidence Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. E.23. This section addresses the proper procedure for filing medical reports
    as evidence, and applies to “a member of a College as defined in subsection 1
    (1) of the <em>Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991</em>”,<i> </i>which
    includes the College of Physiotherapists of Ontario.)</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not adequately perform his gatekeeping function
    in relation to this evidence. I agree with the appellants that the respondents
    should not have been permitted to use the projected excerpts from the expert
    reports, for the following reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, when the appellants raised an objection to the unexpected
    inclusion of medical reports in the brief, the trial judge did not address the
    problem immediately and effectively. Although he ruled that Dr. Soon-Shiong’s
    report could not be an exhibit, he allowed the jury to see it on the projection
    screen. He also failed to rule conclusively on the physiotherapist’s report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It is commonplace in civil actions for counsel to prepare a trial
    document brief containing documents that are admitted as authentic and
    admissible. See <em><span style='font-style:normal'>John Sopinka,</span></em> <i>The
    Trial of an Action</i>, 2nd ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 1998) at pp. 41-42.
    Counsel typically agree on a list of documents and one party attends to the
    brief’s preparation. In this case, Mr. Forget’s office assembled the respondents’
    medical brief, which he tendered at the beginning of the trial and which became
    Exhibit 1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It is regrettably not unusual, however, for counsel to differ on the
    precise basis on which a document in the brief is being tendered or whether it
    was to have been included, as the implications materialize in the course of the
    trial. That happened here, where the appellants thought no medical reports were
    to be included in the brief, but the respondents included the reports. The trial
    judge should have addressed the problem quickly and completely. Instead, by permitting
    cross-examination to proceed with the reports projected for the jury’s view, the
    trial judge exposed the appellants to the potential for the jury to be
    prejudiced by the disputed reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, the projected words would have distracted the jury when
    their attention should have been on the witness. It is to be expected that the
    projected words from a medical report would carry great weight with the jury,
    who would naturally see them as likely to be true.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Third, the cross-examination implicitly relied on the hearsay value
    of the reports before they had been properly admitted. Counsel presented the
    words as true. This allowed the respondents to attack Mr. Iannarella’s
    credibility in a manner that side-stepped their obligation to comply with the rule
    in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i>. The impression on the jury could not likely be undone
    either by an effective cross-examination of the practitioner or by a jury
    instruction, both of which would occur much later in the trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Fourth, this approach allowed the respondents to get around the usual
    requirement that, absent special circumstances, parties must choose between
    filing a medical report as evidence under s. 52 of the <em>Evidence Act</em>,
    and calling the practitioner as a witness. See <em>Ferraro v. Lee</em> (1974), 2
    O.R. (2d) 417 (C.A.), at para. 6; <em>Pool v. Lehoux</em>, 2007 ONCA 630, at
    para. 7;<i> <em>Beck v. Blane</em></i>, [1999] O.J. No. 529 (C.A.), at para. 4;
    Fuerst &amp; Sanderson, at pp. 954-956, 958. The jury effectively heard from
    Dr. Soon-Shiong twice, without consideration as to how this could impact the
    appellants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>There are circumstances when the projection of an image in front of
    a jury during cross-examination is helpful, for example when the witness is
    being examined on a pictorial image like a map, a photograph or a diagram. However,
    reports from medical practitioners who will also be called to testify give rise
    to unique concerns. The trial judge recognized some of these issues, stating:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The difficulty always is that when doctors attend and give
    evidence from their reports, almost always, the reports do not comprise the
    entirety of their evidence as you know. There are speaking points. Some things
    that are in the report never make it into evidence so better not to show the
    members of the jury that which may not become the evidence of those doctors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Nonetheless, the trial judge permitted a number of reports to be
    projected before the jury. Regardless of whether or not the reports were
    ultimately formally admitted as exhibits, the “slide show” had already
    permitted the jury to view some of their contents. This could not be undone. As
    this court noted in <em>Pool v. Lehoux</em>, at para. 7,<i> </i>there can be no
    hard and fast rule. However, the respondents’ use of medical and other report
    excerpts in cross-examining Mr.&nbsp;Iannarella in this trial should not have
    been permitted by the trial judge. </span></p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Threshold Motion</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Based on the entirety of the evidence at trial, the trial judge
    found that Mr.&nbsp;Iannarella had not proven that he had a permanent
    impairment of a physical or psychological function caused by the accident, and exercised
    his authority under s. 267.5 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> to dismiss the appellants’
    claim for non-pecuniary damages. The trial was, however, unfair for the reasons
    set out earlier. It is not possible to discern whether the trial judge’s ruling
    was based solely on admissible evidence. The threshold ruling must be set
    aside.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants make a number of specific complaints about the trial
    judge’s threshold ruling. Since there is to be a new trial, there is no need
    for me to rule on those complaints. It will be the task of the trial judge at
    the second trial to consider the threshold issues under s. 267.5 of the <em>Insurance
    Act</em> based on the evidence that is admitted at that trial if a threshold
    motion is brought. </span></p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Costs Disposition</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge <span lang=EN-US>awarded the respondents partial indemnity costs to
    the date of their “substantial” offer to settle on March 12, 2012, and
    substantial indemnity costs thereafter. This was an award to the respondents of
    about $255,000 for a fifteen-day trial that extended over four weeks. The trial
    judge rejected evidence that the appellants were impecunious, noting that they
    had equity in their home.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Since the appeal is to be allowed, the costs disposition is to be
    set aside. I do, however, wish to make several observations about the trial
    judge’s costs disposition. The action was dismissed, and the defendants would
    ordinarily be entitled to no more than costs on a partial indemnity basis. But
    the costs award on a substantial indemnity basis was distinctly punitive to the
    appellants, who stand to lose their home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge stated that he was exercising his discretion under
    this court’s decision in <em>S.&amp; A. Strasser Ltd. v. Richmond Hill (Town) </em>(1990),
    1 O.R. (3d) 243 (C.A.). In that case the court cited rule 49.13, which provides
    that notwithstanding rule 49.10, in assessing costs a court “may take into
    account any offer to settle made in writing.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The development of this court’s approach to awards of substantial
    indemnity costs has evolved since <em>Strasser</em>, as this court noted in <em>Davies
    v. Clarington (Municipality)</em>, 2009 ONCA 722, </span>100 O.R. (3d) 66<span
lang=EN-US>. Outside of rule 49.10, to make such an award as a matter of
    judicial discretion the court must find that the party has been guilty of egregious
    misconduct in the proceeding. See <em>St. Elizabeth Home Society v. Hamilton
    (City)</em>, 2010 ONCA 280, at para. 92 and <em>McBride Metal Fabricating Corp.
    v. H. &amp; W. Sales Co.</em> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A), at para. 39. I can
    see no basis in this case on which the trial judge could have found such
    misconduct on the appellants’ part. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Moreover, the trial judge did not take into account the respondents’
    breaches of the <em>Rules</em>, which should have attracted countervailing
    weight in the fixing of the trial costs: see <i>Capela </i>and <em>Beland</em><i>.</i></span></p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disposition</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span

    the appellants’ liability appeal, <span lang=EN-US>set aside the judgment and

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
