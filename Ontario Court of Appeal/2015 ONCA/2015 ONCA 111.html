  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on June 29, 2011 and
    the sentence entered on September 23, 2011 by Justice T. Ducharme of the Superior
    Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, with reasons for sentence reported at 2011
    ONSC 5552.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Hourigan J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Judge>Overview</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>John Magno appeals his conviction on charges of
    manslaughter, conspiracy to commit arson, arson causing bodily harm and arson
    for fraudulent purposes.  He also seeks leave to appeal his sentence of 12
    years’ imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the conviction appeal, the appellant submits
    that the trial judge erred in his <em>Vetrovec</em> warning to the jury and in
    admitting certain hearsay statements of the appellant’s alleged co-conspirators.
    The appellant also submits that the verdict is unreasonable. On the sentence
    appeal, he submits that the sentence imposed by the trial judge is unfit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    conviction appeal. While I would grant leave to appeal sentence, I would also
    dismiss the sentence appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the evening of December 24, 2001, the
    appellant’s hardware store, Woodbine Building Supply (“WBS”), was looted. Seven
    people were present during the looting: Tony Jarcevic, Jonathan “Sam” Paskalis,
    Shaun McMaster, Jason Regaldo, Chris Graham, Denver Read and Jennifer Read.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Later that night, Jarcevic and Paskalis set fire
    to WBS, causing a large explosion that completely destroyed the building. As a consequence
    of the explosion and fire, Jarcevic died and Paskalis was seriously injured. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant made an insurance claim of approximately
    $3,000,000 for the destruction of WBS, which has not been paid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following an investigation into the fire, which
    included telephone wiretaps and vehicle probes, the police arrested all those
    who were present at WBS on the evening of the arson, as well as Adrian Roks and
    the appellant. For their roles in the scheme, Paskalis, McMaster and Roks were convicted
    of manslaughter and Regaldo was convicted of conspiracy to commit arson.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was charged with second-degree
    murder, conspiracy to commit arson, arson causing bodily harm and arson for
    fraudulent purposes. The sole issue at trial was whether the appellant was a
    participant in the conspiracy to burn down WBS. The appellant did not testify.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s theory at trial was that the
    appellant hired Paskalis to organize and commit an undetected arson at WBS. The
    alleged purpose of the arson was to save demolition costs and gain insurance
    proceeds to fund a condominium development on the land.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Defence counsel argued that all of the evidence
    implicating the appellant in the arson scheme originated from Paskalis, who was
    an inherently unreliable witness due to his history of criminal activity and
    lying to the authorities. </span>The theory of the defence was that Paskalis
    was attempting to shift the blame to the appellant for an arson that he
    orchestrated as a cover-up for the looting of WBS.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence relied on wiretap evidence to
    demonstrate collusion among the Crown’s witnesses. In particular, defence
    counsel pointed to conversations intercepted by the police that revealed that Paskalis
    told Roks what to tell the police and that Paskalis was angry that Graham had given
    the police information that contradicted his story.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, Roks, Graham, Regaldo and McMaster all
    admitted at trial to discussing their stories with each other after the fire and
    to lying to the police after receiving instructions to do so from Paskalis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Paskalis also admitted that he had met
    repeatedly with the other men after the fire to discuss what they were telling
    the police. In particular, he admitted to conspiring with Roks to lie to the police
    and to threatening Graham to change his story.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown was permitted to adduce hearsay
    evidence of the appellant’s involvement in the arson scheme under the
    co-conspirator exception. In particular, Regaldo testified that Jarcevic said
    he was going to burn down the appellant’s store for insurance money and to “get
    in good” with Paskalis and the appellant. Regaldo also testified that on the
    night of the fire, Roks said he was going to the appellant’s house to provide
    the appellant with an alibi.  Further, Regaldo testified that, after the fire,
    Roks told him the appellant could not talk to him because “there was a lot of
    heat”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>McMaster also provided hearsay evidence
    implicating the appellant in the arson scheme. He testified that Paskalis and
    Roks told him the purpose of the fire was to collect the appellant’s insurance
    proceeds. McMaster also testified that Roks said he was going to be at the
    appellant’s house as an alibi. He further testified that, after the fire, Roks
    said he deleted photos showing a “tie” between Jarcevic and the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After receiving instructions from the trial
    judge, which included a <em>Vetrovec</em><i> </i>warning to approach the
    evidence of the colluding witnesses with caution, the jury found the appellant
    guilty of the lesser included offence of manslaughter, as well as the three
    arson offences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When considering the appropriate sentence, the trial
    judge found that the appellant was the chief instigator and operating mind
    behind the arson, had promised remuneration to the co-conspirators for their
    involvement, and had participated in the conspiracy to cover up the arson. The
    trial judge ordered a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment, less two
    years’ credit for pre-trial custody and restrictive bail.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Positions of the Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals the conviction on three
    grounds. First, he submits that the trial judge erred in his <em>Vetrovec</em> warning
    by instructing the jury that the colluding witnesses could potentially confirm
    each other’s evidence. The appellant’s position is that whether evidence is
    capable of being confirmatory is a question of law to be determined by the
    trial judge. Therefore, where witness collusion is indisputable, as in this
    case, the trial judge must instruct the jury that the evidence of the colluding
    witnesses cannot be mutually confirmatory, rather than leaving this
    determination to the jury. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred in admitting certain hearsay statements under the co-conspirator
    exception. In particular, he argues that the statements were not made in
    furtherance of any conspiracy involving the appellant; that the content of the
    statements originated from Paskalis, whom the trial judge found to be an inherently
    unreliable witness; and that the statements were not necessary, as all the
    co-conspirators, except the deceased Jarcevic, were available to, and did in
    fact, testify at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the appellant submits that the jury’s
    verdict is unreasonable because all the evidence implicating the appellant
    originated from an unreliable witness, Paskalis. He argues that no other
    evidence supported the verdict, or, if it did, it was insufficient to ground
    the verdict without Paskalis’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also seeks leave to appeal the
    sentence, submitting that the trial judge unfairly dismissed an array of pro-social
    mitigating factors and that the sentence is unfit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent submits that the trial judge
    correctly instructed the jury on the evidence of the co-conspirators. In the
    respondent’s view, the evidence of these witnesses was not incapable of being
    mutually confirmatory. Although the witnesses admitted to colluding to
    frustrate the police investigation, it was up to the jury to determine whether
    that collusion affected the independence of the evidence the witnesses gave at
    trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the respondent submits that the trial
    judge provided the jury with a clear, accurate and thorough <em>Vetrovec</em><i> </i>warning in accordance with the framework set out in <em>R. v. Khela</em>,
    2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104. He devoted nine pages of his charge to general
    instructions on this issue and gave additional witness-specific cautions. Most
    significantly, the trial judge instructed the jury that if they believed the
    witnesses colluded in terms of what they said at trial, their evidence could
    not be considered independent and mutually confirmatory. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With regard to the hearsay statements, the
    respondent submits that they were properly admitted under the co-conspirator
    exception. The necessity requirement is met not only where a witness is
    unavailable to testify, but also where he cannot be expected to provide
    evidence of the same value at trial, as was the case here. Further, weaknesses
    in the reliability of the evidence go to weight, for the jury to assess. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Next, the respondent submits that the verdict
    was not unreasonable as there was evidence of the appellant’s close
    relationship with Paskalis, as well as his motive for and involvement in the
    arson scheme. It was open to the jury to accept some, none or all of the
    evidence given by the colluding witnesses, and to consider additional
    inculpatory evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the respondent submits that the
    sentence is fit for the primary motivator of the arson, and that the trial judge
    made no error in principle.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issues are, therefore, as follows:</span></p>

    is an instruction about the essential characteristics of confirmatory evidence.
    Jurors are to be told that, in determining the veracity of the suspect
    evidence, they should look for evidence from another source tending to show
    that the untrustworthy witness is telling the truth about the guilt of the
    accused: <em>Khela</em>, at para. <span lang=FR-CA>37; <em>R. v. Kehler</em>,

    some part of his story that goes to show that the accused committed the offence
    charged (the implicative quality or materiality requirement): <em>Kehler</em>,

    (3d) 582</span><span lang=EN-US>, Osborne J.A. considered the degree of
    collaboration or collusion necessary before the evidence of one unsavoury
    witness cannot be corroboratory of another unsavoury witness. In that case, three <i>Vetrovec </i>witnesses had collaborated with each other to some degree
    before they spoke to police. The trial judge instructed the jury to scrutinize
    the evidence of each of the three very carefully and to look for other
    supporting evidence before convicting the accused. In holding that the trial
    judge’s <i>Vetrovec </i>charge was sufficient, Osborne J.A. wrote, at paras.
    115-17, 120: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>On a common sense basis, the jury should be directed to look
    for any evidence which the jury accepts, that would cause the jury to
    reasonably conclude that the untrustworthy witness is telling the truth. That
    evidence does not have to implicate the accused: this relic pertaining to the
    law of corroboration was jettisoned in Vetrovec. Supporting evidence could come
    from another untrustworthy witness, if the duly cautioned jury chooses to
    believe it. That is to say, it is for the jury to determine whether the
    evidence of one unsavoury witness can provide support for the evidence of
    another. If there are circumstances such as collaboration among the Vetrovec
    witnesses, the jury should be alerted to that fact which will obviously
    militate against using the evidence of one unsavoury witness to support the
    evidence of another. It is for the jury to determine whether an untrustworthy
    witness's evidence is so compromised by collaboration that it could not
    reasonably be used to support the evidence of another untrustworthy witness.
    The final credibility call is, I emphasize, for the jury.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Had the jury concluded that the evidence of Robert, Tina and
    Chris [the three unsavoury witnesses] was fatally compromised by collaboration,
    it would as a matter of common sense follow that the evidence of any one of
    them could not be used to provide support for the evidence of either of the
    others. As I have said, this is a matter that should be left to the jury to
    determine.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my opinion, the Vetrovec charge was sufficient. The jury was
    directed by clear language to expose the evidence of Robert, Tina and Chris to
    special scrutiny. The trial judge reminded the jury that they discussed what
    they would say to the police and that each of them had made false statements to
    the police. Consistent with Vetrovec, it was for the jury to determine whether
    the evidence of any of Robert, Tina and Chris was compromised by a desire to
    protect themselves, or by their discussions about what they would say, and did
    say, to the police. The jury was duly warned about the danger of accepting
    their evidence. </p>

  <p class=CQuote>I am not prepared to hold that the evidence of one unsavoury

    be inconsistent with Vetrovec, supra, and Bevan, supra. The jury was very much
    aware that Robert, Tina and Chris to some degree collaborated before they first
    spoke to the police. Indeed, their credibility was challenged at both ends of
    the spectrum during their cross-examination and in defence counsel's closing
    submissions. On the one hand, it was suggested that they had jointly discussed
    their versions of events and that that explained the structural similarity in
    their evidence. On the other hand, each of them was attacked on the basis of
    inconsistencies in his or her evidence when it was compared with the evidence
    of the other two unsavoury witnesses.</p>

    potentially confirmatory of each other’s evidence must be so tainted by
    collusion that it loses its required independence and cannot reasonably be used

  <p class=CQuote>[T]he absence or presence of confirmatory evidence plays a key
    role in determining whether it is safe to rely on the testimony of an impugned
    witness (<em>Harris</em>, at p. 222).&nbsp; Accordingly, the instruction to the
    jury must make clear the type of evidence capable of offering support. It is
    not sufficient to simply tell the jury to look for whatever it feels confirms
    the truth of a witness’ testimony (see <em>R. v. Chenier</em> (2006), 205
    C.C.C. (3d) 333 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 34).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    provide an exhaustive list of all potentially confirmatory evidence. Indeed, in
    some instances the recitation of a seemingly endless list of evidence which is
    potentially supportive of the untrustworthy witness and, necessarily, the
    Crown’s case, can result in an injustice to the accused by upsetting the
    required balance in the charge: <em>R. v. Bevan</em>, </span>[1993] 2 S.C.R.
    599, <span lang=EN-US>at p. 613. Therefore, it is left to the trial judge’s

  <p class=CQuote>As a result of those factors you may find that none of their

    independent for you to rely upon it as corroboration one for the other. You may

    with the exception of the reference to the evidence of the co-conspirators as potentially
    confirmatory, the <em>Vetrovec</em> caution was correct. The issue then is
    narrowed to whether the evidence of the co-conspirators should have been left
    with the jury to determine if it was sufficiently independent to be mutually
    confirmatory.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence of one <em>Vetrovec</em><i> </i>witness
    can confirm the evidence of another <em>Vetrovec</em><i> </i>witness<i>. </i>However,
    to be confirmatory, the evidence must be independent. Collusion among <em>Vetrovec</em> witnesses can, but will not necessarily, deprive the evidence of the requisite
    quality of independence.  The question is ultimately not whether the witnesses
    colluded, but rather whether there was collusion that rendered the evidence of
    one not independent from the evidence of the other.  The independence inquiry
    looks to the impact of collusory conduct on the independence of the evidence,
    not the independence of the witnesses from each other: <i>Winmill</i>, at

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge
    failed to fulfill his gatekeeper function because he instructed the jury that
    the evidence of the co-conspirators could potentially be confirmatory when that
    evidence was, in fact, not sufficiently independent. The Crown submits that the
    trial judge has no gatekeeping role in these circumstances and that the
    determination of whether the evidence is independent is part of the jury’s
    fact-finding function. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the Crown that the determination of
    whether evidence is independent, and therefore potentially confirmatory of the
    testimony of a <i>Vetrovec</i> witness, is primarily part of the jury’s
    fact-finding function. Independence in the context of the <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction cannot be confused with the absence of tainting or collusion in the
    context of similar fact evidence. While both address questions of the
    independence of evidence, they do so in very different contexts, which impacts
    the extent of the trial judge’s gatekeeping function. </span></p>

    presumptively inadmissible, the independence of the evidence – that is, the
    absence of collusion or tainting – is fundamental to determining the probative
    value and hence the admissibility of the evidence.  Consequently, a trial judge
    has a significant gatekeeping role to play and must exclude the proffered
    evidence unless satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the similarities
    are not the product of collusion or tainting:  <i>R. v. Handy</i>, </span>2002

    arises in the context of its ability to rehabilitate a <i>Vetrovec</i> witness,
    there is no question about the admissibility of the evidence.  Rather, the
    question is how the trier of fact may use the admissible evidence. In this
    context, the trial judge has a more modest role to play in assessing the
    independence of the evidence. He or she must determine if the evidence is
    capable of being viewed as independent of the <i>Vetrovec</i> witness’
    evidence. If there is a reasonable basis for a finding that the evidence is
    independent of the testimony of the <i>Vetrovec</i> witness, the trial judge must
    allow the jury to exercise its fact-finding function and make the ultimate
    determination as to the independence of the evidence.  </span></p>

    the jury’s untrained eyes, appears potentially confirmatory, but cannot in law
    be confirmatory.  In those cases, the trial judge must ensure that the jury is
    not misled by identifying the evidence and instructing the jury that it is not
    capable of providing independent confirmation of the <i>Vetrovec</i> witness. For
    example, where a prior consistent statement or impermissible hearsay evidence
    appears to be confirmatory, the trial judge would be obliged to explain to the
    jury why they cannot rely on that evidence as confirmatory. This is not a matter
    of usurping the jury’s fact-finding function; they have no such function where
    they could not reasonably conclude that the evidence was independent.</span></p>

    admitted to discussing their stories with each other both before and after
    providing statements to the police. The wiretap evidence also makes clear that
    they were attempting to minimize their involvement in the robbery and fire. In
    addition, the co-conspirators admitted at trial that they colluded to frustrate
    the police investigation. However, there was no clear evidence that the
    co-conspirators colluded for the specific purpose of implicating the appellant.
    The only collusion evidence that directly referred to the appellant was the
    direction given by Paskalis to Roks and Graham to tell the police that the
    appellant knew Paskalis was at WBS the night of the fire. Paskalis testified
    that this direction was meant to support his fabricated alibi that he went to
    WBS to pick something up, with the appellant’s permission, and when he arrived
    there, the building exploded. Therefore, while there was undisputed evidence
    that the co-conspirators colluded to exculpate themselves, there was no clear,

    from their post-arson police statements, which were intended to frustrate the
    police investigation. Most notably, at trial, the co-conspirators admitted that
    they colluded to cover-up the arson. However, they did not concede that they
    colluded regarding their trial evidence or that their evidence was tainted by reason
    of their knowledge of the Crown’s theory, or their desire to co-operate with
    the police to reduce their sentences. </span></p>

    not been tainted in this way. Therefore, the jury had a role to play in
    determining if the co-conspirators</span>’ <span lang=EN-US>evidence was
    independent and the trial judge did not err in pointing to this evidence as
    potentially confirmatory.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> With respect to the argument that the evidence
    could not be independent because Paskalis was the original source of it all, I
    note that the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that “[i]f the
    evidence is connected to the untrustworthy witness, it cannot confirm his
    evidence”.  He explained, for example, that if Roks reported something that
    Paskalis said to him, that evidence could not confirm the evidence of Paskalis.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that Paskalis was the
    actual source of statements attributed to Jarcevic to the effect that he was
    going to set fire to WBS for the insurance proceeds and that this was his opportunity
    to “get in good with Sam [Paskalis] and John [the appellant].”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the appellant, there is an irresistible
    inference on the entirety of the record that these statements originated from
    Paskalis because Jarcevic did not have any direct contact with the appellant. Rather,
    Paskalis was the only one who testified to having direct communications with
    the appellant about the arson scheme. Although Paskalis testified that Jarcevic
    and Roks were present at one of the meetings with the appellant, cellphone
    tracking evidence indicated, and the Crown conceded, that Jarcevic could not
    have been at the appellant’s home at the time of the alleged meeting.
    Therefore, the appellant submits that Paskalis must have been the source of Jarcevic’s
    belief that the appellant was involved in the scheme, which Jarcevic then passed
    on to Regaldo and McMaster.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> On this basis, the appellant submits that the
    trial judge’s admission of the statements attributed to Jarcevic effectively
    permitted Paskalis’s unreliable statements to be admitted into evidence,
    despite the trial judge’s determination that they should not be admitted due to
    their lack of reliability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While it was open to the jury to find that
    Paskalis was the source of all Jarcevic’s statements implicating the appellant,
    I am not satisfied that this was the only available inference. Rather, it was
    open to the jury to find that the statements originated from the appellant himself. </span></p>

    member of the conspiracy: <em>R. v. Carter</em>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, at p. 946; <em>R. v. Barrow</em>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694, at para. 73. </span></p>

    on-going criminal conspiracy, and given that the statements were on a subject
    matter within the particular knowledge of the appellant, being the WBS insurance
    proceeds, it was open to the jury to find that Jarcevic’s statements were sourced
    to the appellant, rather than by Paskalis. Therefore, the trial judge did not
    err in instructing the jury that these statements could potentially serve as independent
    and confirmatory evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge delivered lengthy reasons on the <em>voir dire</em> requested by the Crown to admit certain hearsay statements
    made by the alleged co-conspirators: see <em>R. v. Magno</em>, </span>2012 ONSC
    4001<span lang=EN-US>. Due to serious concerns about the reliability of this
    evidence, the trial judge found this to be one of the exceptional cases where
    the co-conspirator exception to the inadmissibility of hearsay evidence should
    not automatically apply, and a principled analysis was required. The trial judge
    was, therefore, clearly alive to the potential unreliability of this evidence and
    significantly limited the hearsay statements that were admitted for
    consideration by the jury. In particular, he refused to admit statements made
    by Paskalis on the basis that Paskalis is “an inveterate liar” and his
    statements are, therefore, not reliable (para. 82). The trial judge also
    excluded certain statements he found were not in furtherance of the conspiracy.
    In the end, after carefully establishing their necessity and reliability, the
    trial judge admitted only 13 of the 27 hearsay statements the Crown attempted
    to introduce under the co-conspirator exception.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, there is no basis to interfere with
    the trial judge’s ruling on the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule,
    as I agree with and adopt his reasoning. The arguments made on appeal were all
    made on the <em>voir dire</em> and the trial judge properly rejected them. I
    focus my analysis below on the three principal arguments made by the appellant
    in support of this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant submits that statements attributed
    to Roks in the testimony of Regaldo and McMaster should not be admitted.  The
    trial judge admitted those statements on the basis that there was “very clear
    evidence” that Roks was involved both in the original arson conspiracy and the
    post-arson cover-up conspiracy, and that he would not be a co-operative witness
    (paras. 85-86). </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Helvetica","sans-serif"'>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in this regard because t</span><span
lang=EN-US>here was no necessity that these statements be admitted since Roks
    was called as a witness and was not hostile. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I disagree. The issue of leading a
    co-conspirator’s hearsay declaration when the witness is available to testify
    was raised but not answered in <em>R. v. Chang</em> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 397
    (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 107, 110.<strong> </strong>However, as noted by Blair
    J.A. in <em>R. v. N.Y.</em>, 2012 ONCA 745, 270 C.R.R. (2d) 294, at para. 78, <em>Chang</em><i> </i>did not say that non-compellability is required to satisfy the necessity
    requirement. Rather, “</span>it is&nbsp;<em><span lang=EN-US>the availability
    of the evidence, not the availability of the witness</span></em> that is of
    ultimate significance, and…while co-conspirators may be physically available,
    their testimony rarely is” (<span lang=EN-US>emphasis in original).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Our courts give the necessity criterion a
    flexible definition, capable of encompassing diverse situations: <em>R. v.
    Smith</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915,
    at pp. 933-34. The necessity criterion is satisfied where it cannot be expected
    that evidence of the same value from the same or other sources will be
    available. Thus, the necessity criterion is fact-specific and its precise
    limits remain to be established in the context of specific cases: <em>Chang,</em> at para. 105; <em>R. v B. (K.G.)</em>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, at p. 798.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his ruling on the co-conspirator exception,
    the trial judge explicitly turned his mind to the fact that Roks was available
    to testify. He also noted that there must be an evidentiary basis for a finding
    of necessity and that it should not be based on mere speculation. The trial
    judge went on to consider Roks’ particular circumstances: “His conviction for
    murder is currently under appeal, he has always maintained his innocence and,
    while he has previously testified, it is obvious that he will not admit making
    any statements that would implicate him in the conspiracy.” The trial judge
    concluded that the necessity criterion was satisfied since Roks would not admit
    to making the statements. I see no flaw in this analysis. It was clear that
    Roks’ evidence at trial would not be of the same value as the hearsay statements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant objects to certain statements
    attributed to Jarcevic</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Helvetica","sans-serif"'> in the testimony of Regaldo and McMaster, which were admitted on the basis that
    “</span><span lang=EN-US>the defence has not identified anything about the
    reliability of his statements that would justify keeping them from the jury.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues again, as he did with
    respect to the <em>Vetrovec</em><i> </i>warning, that these statements must
    have originated from Paskalis, whom the trial judge found to be such an
    unreliable witness that none of his statements were admitted through the
    co-conspirator hearsay exception. The appellant submits that by admitting these
    statements, the trial judge effectively allowed Paskalis's statements into
    evidence, thereby contradicting his own decision to exclude them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For this argument to prevail, the only available
    inference open to the jury was to find that Paskalis was the original source of
    all of the statements. However, for the reasons given above, I am not satisfied
    that this was the only available inference. Accordingly, this argument must
    fail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the appellant submits that statements
    made after the fire are not admissible because there was no evidence that the
    appellant was involved in a post-arson conspiracy. Therefore, he argues that these
    statements were not in furtherance of any conspiracy involving the appellant.</span></p>

    was a member of conspiracy, the object of which was to defraud the appellant’s
    insurer or, in the alternative, to evade detection after the arson. The
    appellant submitted that the object of the conspiracy was simply to commit the
    arson and, therefore, statements made after the arson could not be in
    furtherance of the conspiracy</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:16.0pt;

lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge averted to the admonition of
    Martin J. A. in <em>R. v. Baron</em><i> and <em>Wertman</em> </i>(1976), 14 O.R.
    (2d) 173 (C.A.), at p. 198, that to “engraft a conspiracy to avoid detection
    and prosecution, as a matter of law, on every conspiracy to commit a crime
    would have far-reaching implications”. However, he also noted that Martin&nbsp;J.A.
    expressly recognized that a post-offence conspiracy to evade detection and
    prosecution could be established by evidence in the same manner as any other
    conspiracy para. 37). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was careful not to usurp the
    role of the jury to determine the object of the conspiracy, and limited his
    analysis to the question of whether the particular statements were capable of
    coming within the co-conspirator exception.&nbsp; He concluded, at para. 51 of
    his ruling on the co-conspirator exception, that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is also evidence upon which the jury could find that Mr.
    Magno was a member of a post-arson conspiracy to avoid detection.&nbsp; Whether
    this latter conspiracy was simply to avoid prosecution or whether it was part
    of a broader continuing conspiracy to defraud the insurer is a matter that must
    be left with the jury.&nbsp;The important point however, is that this means
    that post-arson comments made in furtherance of this conspiracy, however it is
    characterized, are also capable of being admitted under the co-conspirators’
    exception.&nbsp; Thus, I reject the defence submission that all utterances that
    post-date the arson are inadmissible as being incapable of being made in
    furtherance of a conspiracy.&nbsp; These statements may well be and that is
    something for the jury to decide.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the trial judge’s analysis. It was
    open to the jury to conclude that the appellant was engaged in a post-offence
    conspiracy to evade detection and prosecution or in an on-going conspiracy to
    defraud the insurance company. Therefore, I reject the appellant’s argument
    that the statements made after the fire could not be in furtherance of a

    sentence from this court, it would be difficult to say that a 12-year sentence
    for the appellant is inappropriate.  </span></p>

    submission that his incarceration will be emotionally devastating for his
    family.  However, the sentencing judge concluded, as he was entitled to do,
    that this was not a mitigating factor and that the impact on the family
    underscores that they are victims of the appellant.  I see no error in this
    analysis.</span></p>
