  <p class=Heard>Heard: February 18, 2015</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on December 12,
    2012 by Justice Roland J. Haines of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with
    a jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury found the appellant guilty of counts of sexual interference,
    invitation to sexual touching and sexual assault. The complainants, of whom
    there were two, were between 12 and 15 years of age when the offences allegedly
    occurred. The appellant was in a position of trust in relation to each
    complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence advanced at trial through the testimony of the appellant and
    of his wife was that the conduct alleged by each complainant did not occur. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advances five grounds of appeal. Each alleges an error in
    the trial judges final instructions to the jury. None attracted an objection
    at trial. Not when counsel were given the opportunity to make submissions on
    the proposed draft charge. And not after the charge had been delivered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first ground of appeal relates to an omission in the trial judges
    instructions on the use the jury could make of evidence of each complainant in
    determining whether Crown counsel had proven the case against the appellant in
    relation to the other complainant. This across counts use of evidence of
    similar acts was the subject of a ruling by the trial judge, a ruling that is
    not contested here. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The deficiency alleged is that the trial judge did not give an express
    instruction that enjoined jury use of the evidence to conclude that the
    appellant was a bad person, and thus likely to have committed the offences
    charged. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that it obviously would have been better had the injunction
    against bad personhood reasoning been included in express terms in the instruction
    in accordance with the specimen instructions routinely used in this province.
    That said, however, we are not prepared to say that the omission caused the
    appellant any prejudice. The evidence at issue was not evidence of extrinsic
    misconduct. It did not reflect any general propensity or prior discreditable
    conduct on the part of the appellant. The jury was apprised of the permitted
    use of the evidence in unexceptionable terms and was expressly told that they
    were not permitted to find the appellant guilty on any count simply because
    they had found him guilty on another count. In this case, that was a sufficient
    prophylactic against bad personhood reasoning. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground of appeal alleges error in the trial judges failure
    to rehearse the similarities and differences in the evidence of the
    complainants as part of his instructions on the jurys potential use of the
    evidence as evidence of similar acts across the counts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed the similarities in the evidence of the
    complainants that were relevant for the jurys consideration in deciding
    whether a pattern of similar conduct had been established as a basis for them
    to apply the evidence across counts. The similar act evidence here was not
    adduced to prove identity and thus was not required to meet the more stringent
    degree of similarity required in such cases. In those cases, dissimilarities
    are more telling than in cases, such as this, where the issue to which the
    evidence is directed is the occurrence of an event and the credibility of a
    witness who has testified about it. The trial was brief. The evidence was fresh
    in the minds of the jury and rehearsed in sufficient detail by the trial judge
    to point out the dissimilarities in the accounts. The jury was told of the
    requirement that they find similarity as a condition precedent to use the
    evidence across counts. The relevance of dissimilarities seems unlikely to have
    been lost on them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third ground of appeal alleges error in failing to leave evidence of
    collusion to the jury as a basis for an instruction that would diminish the
    probative force of the evidence of similar acts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his ruling on the Crowns application to adduce across counts use of the
    evidence of each complainant, the trial judge considered and rejected a claim
    of collusion as a basis to dismiss the Crowns application. The evidence is
    barren of any suggestion of deliberate, practiced collusion. The submission of
    inadvertent collusion because one complainant was aware of the fact of the
    others complaint affords no basis for such an instruction as is sought here. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final two grounds of appeal may be considered together. Each alleges an error,
    either of omission or commission, in the trial judges instructions about the
    manner in which the jury was to assess the credibility of each complainant.
    Trial counsel, who saw and heard each witness testify, sought no such
    instruction. The trial judge identified several inconsistencies in the evidence
    of each complainant and pointed out the intellectual limitations of one of the
    complainants as a factor for the jury to consider. He fully and fairly
    summarized the defence position in relation to each. In this brief trial what
    was said adequately equipped the jury to perform their adjudicative function. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed. </p>
