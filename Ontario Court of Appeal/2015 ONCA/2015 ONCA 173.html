  <p class=Heard>Heard: February 12, 2015</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Frederick L. Myers of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated September 9, 2014.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Weiler
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is another appeal respecting the circumstances in which an action
    that has been dismissed for delay may be reinstated pursuant to rule 37.14 of
    the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure, </em>R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> This case arose from the application of the former rule 48.14, which required that
    an action be set down for trial within two years after the filing of the first
    statement of defence.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Because the appellants, H.B. Fuller Company and H.B. Fuller Construction
    Products Inc.,<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>had not set the action
    down within the required time limit, the registrar sent a status notice to the
    solicitors acting for the appellants.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> The status notice gave the appellants 90 days to set the action down for trial,
    obtain an order from a judge or master at a status hearing relieving them from this
    requirement, or otherwise conclude the action, for example, by settlement.
    Failing this, the action would be dismissed for delay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The solicitors acting for the appellants did not receive the status
    notice. Although the proper address for service was clearly indicated on the
    statement of claim, the registrar apparently sent the notice to the wrong
    address. The subsequent order from the registrar dismissing the action for
    delay was also sent to the wrong address. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approximately three months after becoming aware of the order of dismissal,
    the appellants brought a motion to set aside the registrar’s order and
    reinstate the action. The motion judge dismissed the motion on the basis that
    the appellants had failed to adequately explain the overall delay in pursuing
    their action and had also failed to discharge the onus on them of proving a lack
    of prejudice to the respondent, Computer Packages Inc. (“CPI”). The appellants
    appeal this decision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal. The motion judge
    erred in two respects. First, he did not give sufficient weight to the
    non-receipt of the registrar’s status notice and the opportunities the
    appellants lost as a result. Second, he erred in the manner in which he assessed
    prejudice to the respondent. Having regard to the errors of the motion judge, I
    would set aside the dismissal order pertaining to CPI and reinstate the action. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>chronology of the litigation</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sued CPI, a supplier of patent and trademark management
    systems to companies and law firms, for damages in negligence and breach of
    contract. In their statement of claim, the appellants alleged CPI failed to
    monitor the dates when patent maintenance fees for certain of the appellants' patents
    became payable. They further alleged CPI negligently relied on and failed to
    verify the incorrect representations of Rogers, a Toronto-based patent lawyer against
    whom the appellants also brought a claim for damages in negligence. As against
    Rogers, the appellants alleged that he failed to reinstate certain patents and
    failed to pay the applicable maintenance fees, with the result that the
    Canadian Intellectual Property Office considered three patents abandoned. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellants state they discovered the existence of their
    claim in October 2009, they did not commence their action until October 2011,
    one day before the two year limitation period expired. Rogers requested a
    number of extensions of time to file a statement of defence, which he finally did
    on December 21, 2012, more than 14 months after service of the statement of
    claim. The appellants state they initiated discussions regarding discovery, including
    proposed discovery dates for Rogers, in April 2013. On May 17, 2013, counsel
    for Rogers wrote to counsel for CPI and the appellants advising that the
    parties were not yet in a position to agree to a discovery plan as CPI had not
    yet filed its statement of defence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CPI states that, pursuant to August 2012 discussions and a January 8,
    2013, email, the appellants did not specifically require CPI to file a defence.
    Instead the appellants focussed their attention on their claim against Rogers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rogers died on July 17, 2013. On July 22, 2013, CPI served and filed its
    statement of defence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 8, 2013, the registrar issued a status notice. According to
    the affidavit filed by the appellants’ solicitors, the notice was inexplicably
    mailed to a post office box that had been vacated by the law firm in 2004 and
    not to the firm’s address for service shown on the statement of claim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 24, 2014, the registrar dismissed the action for delay, as it had not
    been set down for trial or otherwise concluded within the time prescribed by
    rule 48.14. The appellants’ counsel did not receive the order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ solicitor’s affidavit further states that it was only when he was
    attempting to settle the action with Rogers’ counsel on March 3, 2014, that he
    was advised that the action had been dismissed for administrative delay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead
    of contacting CPI immediately and seeking its consent to set aside the order of
    the registrar, counsel for the appellants took the position that the registrar
    had no jurisdiction to dismiss the action for delay because the status notice
    had not been served in accordance with the rules. This was an error of law. The
    failure to properly serve a status notice is an irregularity and does not oust
    the registrar’s jurisdiction to dismiss the action: <em>Finlay v. Van Paasen</em>,<em> </em>2010 ONCA 204, 101 O.R. (3d) 390, at para. 15. This error of law on the
    part of the appellants’ solicitors does not excuse their delay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
    the appellants’ solicitors continued settlement discussions with Rogers’
    insurer, LawPro.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 13, 2014, CPI notified the appellants by email that it would not be seeking
    costs for the dismissed action. On May 22, 2014, the appellants emailed CPI,
    indicating that they would be bringing a motion to set aside the registrar’s
    order and seeking consent to have the action reinstated. This consent was
    refused. On May 29, 2014, the appellants set out their position that the
    registrar lacked jurisdiction and again sought to obtain CPI’s consent to
    reinstate the action. Again CPI refused. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 9, 2014, about three months after they became aware that the action had
    been dismissed for delay, the appellants brought their motion requesting that
    the registrar’s order be set aside.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s reasons</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citing <em>Finlay, </em>the motion judge rejected the appellants’ argument that the
    registrar lacked jurisdiction to dismiss the action. He observed that the fact
    the notice of status hearing went astray was a factor that weighed strongly in favour
    of reinstating the case, and that <em>Finlay </em>was on all fours with this
    case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then adverted to the contextual balancing of four factors required
    when determining whether an action should be reinstated. He observed that the
    action “moved fairly quickly, if grudgingly.” He held, however, that the
    appellants did not meet their burden to explain the delay. He found the delay
    was attributable to the appellants’ indulgences to the respondent and their
    desire to settle the action with Rogers. Even after finding out their action
    was dismissed, “the plaintiff’s approach was to favour its settlement approach
    with Rogers/LawPro ahead of moving to reinstate with alacrity.” In addition, he
    held that the appellants had not met their burden of showing that Rogers’ death
    in 2013 did not cause any prejudice to CPI. He added that the appellants had
    not shown that the case was a documents case or that Rogers’ evidence was not
    needed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    crux of the motion judge’s reasoning is as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The trial never could have been held in the time between the
    commencement of the action in October 2011 until Mr. Rogers’ death in July
    2013. But discoveries could have been held or Mr. Rogers’ evidence otherwise
    preserved.  The plaintiff bears the outcome of its indulgences and settlement efforts. 
    The action did not have to go into abeyance to discuss settlement. See <em>Faris </em>at paragraph 50.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The plaintiff brought this action in the wrong court, with no
    factum or book of authorities. It treats this action as a sideshow focusing
    instead on settlement with Rogers.  Even there, it has yet to obtain an Order
    to Continue over a year after Mr. Roger[s’] death. The plaintiff cannot meet
    its burden to explain its delay and prove no prejudice either strictly or
    contextually.    </p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>STANDARD OF REVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of a motion judge made pursuant to rule 37.14 is discretionary and is
    entitled to deference on appeal: <em>Finlay</em>, at para. 6. The decision may
    be set aside if the motion judge proceeded on an erroneous legal principle or
    made a palpable and overriding error with respect to the facts: <em>1196158
    Ontario Inc. v. 6274013 Canada Ltd.</em>, 2012 ONCA 544, 353 D.L.R. (4th) 129, at
    para. 16. Reversing a lower court’s discretionary decision is also appropriate
    where the lower court gives no or insufficient weight to relevant
    considerations: <em>Penner v. Niagara Regional Police Services Board</em>, 2013
    SCC 19, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 125, at para. 27.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>analysis </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    hearing a motion to set aside a registrar’s order dismissing an action for
    delay, a judge must consider and weigh the following four well-known factors: the
    length of the litigation delay and whether the plaintiff has provided an
    adequate explanation for it; whether the failure to meet the mandated time
    limits was due to inadvertence; whether the motion to set aside the dismissal
    order was brought promptly; and whether the delay has prejudiced the defendant: <em>Habib v. Mucaj</em>, 2012 ONCA 880, 31 C.P.C. (7th) 1, at para. 5; <em>Hamilton
    (City) v. Svedas Koyanagi Architects Inc.</em>, 2010 ONCA 887, 328 D.L.R. (4th)
    540, at para. 22.<em> </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Requiring
    a party moving to set aside the order dismissing its action for delay to
    satisfy each of the four factors is too rigid an approach. That approach,
    derived from <em>Reid v. Dow Corning Corp. </em>(2001), 11 C.P.C. (5th) 80 (Ont.
    S.C.), at para. 41, rev’d on other grounds (2002), 48 C.P.C. (5th) 93 (Ont.
    Div. Ct.), was overruled in <em>Scaini v. Prochnicki</em>, 2007 ONCA 63, 85
    O.R. (3d) 179. See <em>Marché D’Alimentation Denis Theriault Ltee v. Giant
    Tiger Stores Limited</em>, 2007 ONCA 695, 286 D.L.R. (4th) 487<em>, </em>at
    para. 20. Instead, the judge must adopt an overall contextual approach and, as
    well, take factors unique to the case into consideration. The factors are not
    an end in themselves. Rule 37.14(2) requires that a judge arrive at a just
    result in the particular circumstances of the case: <em>Scaini</em>,<em> </em>at
    paras. 23-24. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    of the later authorities from this court have applied a two-part test that is
    conjunctive, requiring a plaintiff both to provide an acceptable explanation
    for the delay and to show that the defendant would suffer no non-compensable
    prejudice if the action were allowed to proceed: see e.g. <em>Kara v. Arnold</em>,
    2014 ONCA 871,<em> </em>[2014] O.J. No. 5818, at para. 8. This test emerged in
    the context of the similar consideration of whether an action should be
    dismissed for delay following a status hearing under the old rule 48.14(13).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Blair J.A. stated on behalf of the court in <em>Kara</em>,<em> </em>at para.13: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[L]ittle is to be gained by debating whether there is a bright
    line between the “contextual approach” [enunciated in <em>Scaini</em>]<em> </em>and
    the approach enunciated in later authorities such as <em>Faris </em>and <em>1196158
    Ontario Inc. v. 6274013 Canada Ltd.</em> </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Neither the four-factor approach nor the two-part test
    provides an exhaustive list of considerations. Regardless of which is followed,
    all of the circumstances of the case must be considered in order to arrive at a
    just result: see e.g. <em>Hamilton (City)</em>, at paras. 22-23; <em>Marché</em>,
    at para. 20; <em>Finlay</em>, at paras. 27-30; <em>Kara</em>, at paras. 13-15. Furthermore,
    it is not only the plaintiff’s conduct that must be considered. While the
    plaintiff bears primary responsibility for the conduct of the action, the
    defendant’s conduct in the litigation is a relevant circumstance: see <em>Aguas
    v. Rivard Estate</em>, 2011 ONCA 494, 107 O.R. (3d) 142, at paras. 18-19, 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the motion judge adverted to both the four-factor contextual
    approach and <em>Faris v. Eftimonski, </em>2013 ONCA 360, 363 D.L.R. (4th) 111,
    which employs the two-part test<em>. </em>The parties to this appeal agree that
    the issue is whether he applied the relevant factors correctly.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    factors that guide the court’s choice between ending the plaintiff’s action
    before trial and forcing the opposite party to defend the case despite the
    delay require a judge to resolve the tension between two underlying policies.
    The first is that civil actions should be decided on their merits. The second
    is that civil actions should be resolved in a timely and efficient manner in
    order to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice: <em>Kara, </em>at para. 9; <em>Hamilton (City)</em>,<em> </em>at paras. 20-21; <em>Marché</em>,
    at para. 25. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    reviewing a registrar’s dismissal for delay under the former rule 48.14, the
    weight of authority from this court has leaned towards the first policy
    consideration. As Laskin J.A. stated in <em>Hamilton (City), </em>at para. 20,
    quoting with approval the motion judge’s comment, “[T]he court’s bias is in
    favour of deciding matters on their merits rather than terminating rights on
    procedural grounds.”<em> </em>While failure to enforce the rules may undermine
    public confidence in the capacity of the justice system to process disputes
    fairly and efficiently, as Sharpe J.A. observed in <em>119</em>, at para. 19, nonetheless: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[P]rocedural rules are the servants of justice not its master …
    We should strive to avoid a purely formalistic and mechanical application of
    time lines that would penalize parties for technical non-compliance and
    frustrate the fundamental goal of resolving disputes on their merits. [T]he Rules
    and procedural orders are construed in a way that advances the interests of
    justice, and ordinarily permits the parties to get to the real merits of their
    dispute. [<em>119</em>, at para. 19. Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court’s preference for deciding matters on their merits is all the more
    pronounced where delay results from an error committed by counsel. As the court
    stated in <em>Habib,</em> at para. 7, “[O]n a motion to set aside a dismissal
    order, the court should be concerned primarily with the rights of the litigants,
    not with the conduct of their counsel.” In <em>Marché</em>, Sharpe J.A. stated,
    at para. 28, “The law will not ordinarily allow an innocent client to suffer
    the irrevocable loss of the right to proceed by reason of the inadvertence of
    his or her solicitor” (citations omitted).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining whether to reinstate an action that has been dismissed for delay,
    keeping in mind the above observations, the court must consider the rights of
    all the litigants. This necessarily requires consideration not only of the plaintiff’s
    right to have its action decided on its merits, but also consideration of whether
    the defendant has suffered non-compensable prejudice as a result of the delay,
    whether or not a fair trial is still possible, and even if it is, whether it is
    just that the principle of finality and the defendant’s reliance on the
    security of its position should nonetheless prevail. See e.g. <em>119</em>, and<em> Wellwood v. Ontario Provincial Police</em>, 2010 ONCA 386, 319 D.L.R. (4th) 412. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    this jurisprudence in mind, I turn now to its application in this case.</p>
  <h2>1. Explanation for delay</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the motion judge erred in the manner in which he
    assessed the explanation for delay in moving the action forward. In particular,
    they say he placed insufficient weight on the registrar’s failure to serve the
    status notice on the appellants. The appellants rely on <em>Finlay</em>, at
    para. 16, in which Laskin J.A. held that the registrar’s failure to serve a
    status notice on the plaintiff’s counsel was an important consideration in
    deciding whether to set aside the dismissal order and that, so long as
    plaintiff’s counsel had moved promptly after learning of the dismissal order,
    “the interests of justice would demand that the order be set aside.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the motion judge referred to <em>Finlay </em>and noted it was “on all fours”
    with this case, his view was that the appellants did not move promptly enough
    to set aside the order dismissing the action. He placed little weight on the
    fact that the status notice had not been properly served, commenting that “[t]he
    fact that the Status Notice went astray, at best, leads to the outcome that the
    plaintiff should have faced a Status Hearing at which it would have faced the
    burden of the <em>Faris </em>Test.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s analysis ignores the fact the appellants did move to set aside
    the order reasonably quickly – just over three months after the action was
    dismissed for delay. It also ignores the fact that their delay in moving to set
    aside the order was due, in part, to the appellants’ solicitors’ mistaken view
    that the registrar lacked jurisdiction to dismiss the action. While this
    erroneous legal interpretation does not excuse the delay, that the delay
    proceeded from the inadvertence of the appellants’ solicitors is a factor that
    must be considered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, the motion judge also failed to consider that, because the status
    notice went to the wrong address, the appellants lost the opportunity to
    prevent their action being dismissed for delay. In the particular circumstances
    of this case, this was a key factor that had to be considered in assessing
    whether it was just to set aside the order of dismissal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had
    the appellants received the notice to dismiss for delay, they might have been spurred
    to settle the case within the 90-day period afterwards, thereby terminating the
    action as contemplated by rule 48.14(4)(b). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively,
    the appellants could have requested that the registrar arrange a status hearing
    to show cause why the action should not be dismissed. As explained in Todd
    Archibald, Gordon Killeen &amp; James C. Morton, <em>Ontario Superior Court
    Practice</em>, 2015 ed. (Markham, Ont.: LexisNexis, 2014), at p. 1422: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he purpose of a status hearing is to find out why the case
    in question has not been set down for trial within the two-year period
    prescribed by the Rules and to ensure that an order is made to facilitate steps
    to move the case forward. It may be that in unusual and clear cases, where
    there is actual prejudice to D, and a history of flagrant breaches by P of
    various court orders, that the drastic order of dismissing an action at the
    status hearing may be appropriate.  Such an order would be unusual.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  
     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this excerpt makes clear, a status hearing would have provided the appellants
    with a real opportunity to get the action back on track and avoid having it
    dismissed for delay. Because the motion judge did not consider the
    opportunities the appellants lost as a result of not receiving the status
    notice, he gave insufficient weight to this fact in considering whether it was
    just in the circumstances to uphold the order of dismissal.    </p>
  <h2>2. Prejudice</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn now to the manner in which the motion judge assessed prejudice. Recently,
    in <em>MDM Plastics Ltd. v. Vincor International Inc.</em>, 2015 ONCA 28,<em> </em>[2015]
    O.J. No. 265, at para. 25, van Rensburg J.A. explained how prejudice must be
    considered: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The prejudice that the motion judge or master must consider is
    to the defendant’s ability to defend the action that would [arise] from steps
    taken following dismissal, or which would result from restoration of the action
    following the registrar’s dismissal. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    presumption of prejudice can arise from the passage of time, such as the expiry
    of a limitation period or, as here, the death of a witness. However, the plaintiff
    will not necessarily fail to rebut this presumption simply because he or she
    does not adduce affirmative evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Rather, in evaluating the strength of the presumption of
    prejudice the master or motion judge, must consider all of the circumstances, including
    the defendant’s conduct in the litigation. [<em>MDM</em>,<em> </em>at para. 32.
    citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering whether the appellants had rebutted the presumption of prejudice
    arising from Rogers’ death, the motion judge failed to consider evidence
    respecting the respondent’s conduct. Instead, he simply applied the holding in <em>Faris </em>without considering the significant factual differences between the
    defendant’s conduct in that case and the situation here. In so doing, the
    motion judge committed an error that taints his analysis of prejudice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Faris</em>, as in this case, a party died during a period of indulgence
    granted by the plaintiff, namely, an extension of time given to one of the respondents
    to file a statement of defence. However, the chronology of the parties’ actions
    in <em>Faris</em> is significant. In that case, after the party’s death, the respondent
    filed a notice of intent to defend and also requested that the action against it
    be dismissed without costs. The appellant’s lawyer did not respond to this
    request, so the respondent sent two further letters, again asking that it be
    let out of the action. The appellant’s lawyer finally responded, almost a year
    after the first request, at which time he acknowledged receipt of the several
    letters sent throughout the previous year and indicated that he would get
    instructions before the end of the month. He did not do so, and instead only provided
    an answer to the respondent’s request after the status notice was issued a
    further year later. In these circumstances the court held, at para. 50, that it
    was incumbent on the appellant to conduct his action in a proactive manner and that
    it was not unfair to ascribe the prejudice caused by a party’s death to the
    appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, upon Rogers’ death, CPI filed its statement of defence. Then it did nothing
    from July 2013 to May 2014. It did not seek to have the action against it
    dismissed pursuant to Rule 24. During all this time, neither CPI nor LawPro
    raised the failure of the appellants to obtain an order for continuance. CPI
    was content to let the appellants focus on Rogers/LawPro, as any settlement
    they might reach with him potentially reduced its liability. Assuming serious
    negotiations with LawPro were taking place, forcing CPI to incur the cost of
    filing a statement of defence earlier and pushing ahead with discovery would
    not have been in keeping with one of the requirements of rule 1.04, namely, to
    secure the least expensive determination of a civil proceeding. In my view, a just
    resolution should take into consideration not only the plaintiff’s obligation
    to proceed expeditiously, but also the cost to the parties of doing so in the
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    it is incumbent upon a plaintiff to conduct its action in a proactive manner,
    it is unfair in the circumstances of this case to ignore CPI’s passivity. As
    Rosenberg J.A. stated for a majority of this court in <em>Aguas</em>, at para.
    19, while “the appellant, as plaintiff, bore responsibility for moving the
    action along … respondents' counsel's lack of display of any sense of urgency
    undercuts the claim of actual prejudice.” In the circumstances, the motion
    judge’s reliance on <em>Faris</em> without considering the significant factual
    differences between that case and this, and his failure to consider the actions
    of the respondent, led him to err in his assessment of prejudice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    second error on the part of the motion judge with respect to his assessment of
    prejudice is the fact that he did not advert to a significant piece of
    evidence, namely the appellants’ solicitor’s affidavit that he was unaware of
    any prejudice to the respondent in setting aside the order. In concluding the
    appellants had not met their burden of rebutting the presumption of prejudice, it
    was open to the motion judge to reject the affidavit evidence as being a bald and
    unsupported statement: see <em>Faklan </em>(c.o.b. <em>Faklan Health Services)
    v. Niewiadomski, </em>2014 ONCA 697, [2014] O.J. No. 4792, at paras. 2-3.
    However, he was not entitled to simply ignore that evidence: see e.g. <em>O’Dowda
    v. Halpenny</em>, 2015 ONCA 22, [2015] O.J. No. 214, at para. 10. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the motion judge did not link the question of prejudice to whether a fair trial
    was still possible and made no finding in that regard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to these errors, it becomes  necessary  to reweigh the evidence
    respecting prejudice. CPI does not plead specific non-compensable prejudice or
    the inability to defend the action as a result of Rogers’ death. The prejudice
    from Rogers’ death was not increased by the failure of the appellants to set
    the action down within the time limits mandated by the rules. Following Rogers’
    death, settlement negotiations continued. One obvious reason for the protracted
    nature of the negotiations is that the calculation of damages would depend on
    whether the appellants were successful in having their patents reinstated. According
    to CPI, the appellants were successful in having one of the patents reinstated
    and were in the process of resolution with respect to another. Nothing occurred
    between the issuance of the status notice and the motion to set aside the
    dismissal order that increased the prejudice to CPI. Nor was the delay in
    moving to set aside the registrar’s order once it came to the appellants’
    attention so great that the principle of finality and CPI’s reliance on the
    security of its position must prevail. A fair trial is still possible in these
    circumstances.</p>
  <h2 style='page-break-after:avoid'>3. Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the discretionary decision of a lower court is entitled to deference, the
    errors I have identified rise to a level that warrants appellate intervention. Considering
    all the circumstances of this case, I would hold that the appellants have
    explained the delay in their conduct of the litigation and that the delay in
    moving to set aside the dismissal order is not so great as to yield to CPI’s
    reliance on the security of its position. I also conclude that the appellants
    have rebutted the presumption of non-compensable prejudice and it is still
    possible to have a fair trial. </p>
  <h1>F.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>disposition and costs</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would set aside the motion judge’s order dismissing the action and in its

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    office: (a) more than two years have passed since a defence in this action was
    filed.” The first defence in this action was filed on December 21, 2012, and
    the status notice was issued on November 8, 2013. It therefore appears that the
    status notice was sent before the two year period after filing the first
    defence had expired and was therefore premature. No party has raised this and
    the motion judge did not consider it. There may be other facts of which the
    court is unaware and therefore I will decide the case as if the status notice
    had been properly issued.</p>

    provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay, it is still open to the judge
    to dismiss the action even in the absence of proof of actual prejudice to the
    defendant.</p>
