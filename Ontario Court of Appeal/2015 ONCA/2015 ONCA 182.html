  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on November 10,
    2010 by Justice C.D.A. McKinnon of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge>LaForme J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a two-day trial, the trial judge convicted the appellant on two
    counts of sexual assault. The two complainants had waitressed at the
    appellants restaurant during different times. Both testified that they quit
    their jobs because they could not tolerate the appellants sexual touching and
    sexual comments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the Crown led evidence from the two complainants and closed its
    case, the trial judge asked to see counsel in his chambers and suggested a plea
    bargain. The appellant was not present during this discussion. The matters
    discussed in chambers in the appellants absence were not repeated on the
    record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal turns on the propriety of this judge-initiated mid-trial
    discussion. The appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence to establish that the
    trial judges conduct deprived him of his right to be present throughout his
    trial as guaranteed by s. 650(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which requires
    the presence of an accused during the whole of his or her trial. He also
    argues that the mid-trial discussion, in conjunction with the trial judges
    questioning of a defence witness, gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fresh evidence consists of affidavits sworn by the appellant, <span
lang=EN-US>the appellants son (a civil lawyer), the</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>trial
    Crown and the trial defence counsel, and a transcript of the cross-examination
    on each affidavit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each of the affidavits describes the trial judges in-chambers comments
    in a slightly different way, but the essence remains the same. The trial judge
    said that the two complainants had testified well or had been &quot;good
    witnesses&quot;. He then observed that the complainants had testified to
    relatively minor assaults and suggested that the parties resolve the case by
    guilty pleas<span style='line-height:200%'> </span>to common assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant recalls that his trial counsel reported to him after the
    meeting and told him that the trial judge said he was impressed with the two
    complainants and that the defence faced an &quot;uphill battle&quot;. The trial
    judge suggested that the Crown and the defence work out a plea to common
    assault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When court convened for the afternoon session, the trial resumed without
    anyone referencing the in-chambers discussion. The defence called a number of
    witnesses, including several who testified to the appellants reputation for
    honesty. The appellant also testified and denied the allegations. The trial
    judge convicted him of sexually assaulting both complainants.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three related grounds of appeal: (i) the trial
    judge exhibited a reasonable apprehension of bias; (ii) the trial judge
    excluded the appellant <span style='line-height:200%'>from a portion o</span><span
style='line-height:200%'>f his trial contrary to s. 650(</span><span
style='line-height:200%'>1) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em>; <span
style='line-height:200%'>and </span><span style='line-height:200%'>(iii)</span><span
style='line-height:200%'> the trial judge created the appearance of prejudgment
    and unfairness by asking challenging questions of </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>a </span><span style='line-height:200%'>defence witness.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>1.  The Crowns position</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the mid-trial in-chambers discussion fell
    outside the exceptions to s. 650(1). However, she argues that the evidence as a
    whole, including the fresh evidence, demonstrates that the appellant did not suffer
    prejudice and that the mid-trial conference did not create a reasonable
    apprehension of bias. Therefore, the <em>curative proviso</em> at s.
    686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> should apply. She offers a number
    of points in support.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the in-chambers discussion was brief and neither experienced defence counsel
    nor anyone else adverted to the appellants absence. Second, defence counsel
    immediately apprised the appellant of the discussion. Third, defence counsel
    did not apply for a mistrial nor did he discuss that possibility with the
    appellant. In his view, there were no grounds for a mistrial. Fourth, by his
    comments in the meeting, the trial judge does not appear to have made up his
    mind about the outcome of the trial. Fifth, <span lang=EN-US>the appellant did
    not modify his behaviour as a result of the in-chambers meeting  he always
    intended to and in fact did plead not guilty, testify and call evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>In sum, the Crown argues, the mid-trial discussion had no apparent
    or actual effect on trial fairness.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with the Crown and would allow the appeal. The appellant was excluded
    from a portion of his trial in violation of s. 650(1). At the close of the
    Crowns case, the trial judge initiated a mid-trial conversation about the
    resolution of the trial in the absence of the appellant. In a judge-alone criminal
    trial, such a conversation will always prejudice the fair trial interests of
    the accused. Therefore, the <em>curative proviso</em><span style='line-height:
200%'> does not apply.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>2.  The fresh evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    addressing the merits of the appeal, I propose to speak to the appellants
    fresh evidence application. In support of his application, the appellant relies
    on the well-known test <span style='line-height:200%'>for admission of fresh
    evidence set out in</span> <em>R</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>v.</em><em> Palmer</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> (1979), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at 775</span><span
style='line-height:200%'>. </span><em>Palmer</em> requires that the evidence:  (i)
    could not, through the exercise of due diligence, have been adduced at trial;
    (ii) must be relevant in that it bears on a decisive or potentially decisive
    issue; (iii) must be reasonably capable of belief; and (iv) must be such that,
    if believed, it could reasonably be expected to have affected the result at
    trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Palmer </em>criteria speak to new evidence tendered in relation to a
    factual or legal issue at trial.&nbsp;The <em>Palmer </em>criteria do not apply
    where, as here, a party submits fresh evidence to attack the validity of the
    trial process. In such a case, the court will admit the fresh evidence as long
    as it complies with the normal rules of evidence: see <em>R. v. W.(W.)</em> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at 169-70; see also <em>R. v. Taillefer</em>,
    2003 SCC 70, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307, at paras. 76-77.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    my colleague, Doherty J.A., noted in <em>W.(W.)</em>, at paras. 169-70, this
    court's authority to receive evidence on appeal resides in s. 683(1) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em>, which provides that the court may receive evidence on appeal
    where it is &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; to do so. The
    &quot;interests of justice&quot; in this case require that the court admit the
    affidavits and the cross-examinations on those affidavits to determine whether the
    mid-trial in-chambers discussion in the absence of the appellant violated s.
    650 and prejudiced the appellants right to a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will now turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts of this case, the appellant was denied his right to be present in
    court during the whole of his... trial. T<span lang=EN-US>he Crown quite
    appropriately concedes the s. 650(1) breach, but argues that the </span><em>curative
    proviso</em><span lang=EN-US> should save the verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    every in-chambers discussion will constitute part of the accuseds trial. The
    classification of an in-chambers discussion as part of the trial will depend on
    whether the context and contents of the discussion involved or affected the
    vital interests of the accused or whether any decision made bore on the
    substantive conduct of the trial: <em>R. v. Simon</em>, 2010 ONCA 754, 104
    O.R. (3d) 340, at para. 116, leave to appeal refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 459. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the discussion of the evidence and of a possible plea bargain
    involved or affected the vital interests of the appellant. This inevitably
    arose once the trial judge expressed a view about the complainants testimony
    and proposed that the accused enter a guilty plea, although to a lesser and included
    offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has warned that the default position in all criminal trials is that any
    conversation involving trial counsel and the judge ought to take place in the
    [accuseds] presence, in open court, and on the record: <em>R. v. Dayes</em>, <span
style='line-height:200%'>2013 ONCA 614, 117 O.R. (3d) 324, </span>at para. 68.
    Such a practice would avoid the time-consuming and occasionally discomforting
    inquiry into whether this court can salvage a verdict tainted by a s. 650(1)
    violation through resort to the <em>curative proviso</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    spite of the cautions, however, in-chambers discussions without the accused
    continue to take place. Some of those discussions, as here, canvas ways and
    means of resolving the trial. For the following reasons, such discussions
    constitute an error of law for which the appropriate remedy is a new trial.
    That is to say, where a trial judge in a criminal judge-alone trial initiates
    discussions with counsel after the commencement of the trial about the
    possibility of a resolution  in other words, a plea bargain  in the absence
    of the accused, trial fairness will be compromised such that the <em>curative
    proviso</em> will not salvage the verdict.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The s. 650(1) breach and the <em>curative proviso</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is very similar to <em>R. v. Schofield</em>, 2012 ONCA 120, 109 O.R. (3d)
    161, where this court made it abundantly clear that a breach of s. 650(1), in
    circumstances such as those on this appeal, is fatal to trial fairness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MacPherson
    J.A. writing for the court, observed that an in chambers discussion with
    counsel about a possible plea clearly affected the appellants vital interests
    and triggered his right to be present under s. 650 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.
    He further held that the absence of the accused during those discussions, that
    were vital to his interests, undermined the fairness and openness of the trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=reflex3-reflex>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with my colleagues analysis. An accused is entitled to
    have first-hand knowledge of matters vital to his interests as they unfold at
    trial so that he can properly seek and receive legal advice and otherwise
    properly exercise his right to make full answer and defence. Furthermore the
    accuseds presence, when matters vital to his interests are being discussed,
    brings a transparency and appearance of fairness to those proceedings that
    would otherwise be lacking<span class=reflex3-reflex>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=reflex3-reflex>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, <em>Schofield</em> has direct application here. Just
    as in <em>Schofield</em>, the in chambers discussions in the absence of the
    accused violated s. 650. And, just as in <em>Schofield</em>, the Crown cannot
    demonstrate that the violation of s. 650 did not prejudice the appellant.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=reflex3-reflex>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge, <span lang=EN-US>after hearing the testimony of two
    Crown witnesses,</span> initiated a mid-trial discussion in the absence of the
    accused about a possible plea bargain. The discussion was a manifest breach of
    s. 650(1). Though he acted with the best of intentions, the trial judge
    undercut the presumption of innocence and compromised trial fairness. In such
    circumstances, I would not apply the <em>curative proviso</em> under s.
    686(1)(b)(iv).</p>
  <p class=Heading>DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the above reasons, I would admit the fresh evidence and allow the appeal. I
    would set aside the convictions and order a new trial.</p>
