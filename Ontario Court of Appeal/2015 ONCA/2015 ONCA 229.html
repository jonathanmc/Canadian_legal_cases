    20, 2013 and the sentences imposed by Justice Carpenter-Gunn on October 18,

  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was convicted
    of two counts of sexual interference involving S.K. and C.K., the two young daughters
    of his girlfriend.  S.K. was five years of age and C.K. was four years old at
    the time of the offences.<span class=MsoPageNumber>  The appellant was
    acquitted of one count of assault in respect of each of the complainants.  He
    received a global sentence of five years imprisonment: two and one-half years,
    consecutive, on each sexual interference conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant appeals from his
    convictions and seeks leave to appeal his sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant submits that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>i)     the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
    jury that the evidence of one complainant was not admissible on the counts
    relating to the other, and that it could not use propensity reasoning to
    support its verdicts;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii)    the
    trial judge erred in admitting the out-of-court statements of S.K. to her
    grandparents as evidence of the truth of their contents; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>iii)    the
    jury instruction on the manner in which the jury should assess the evidence of
    S.K.s hearsay statements was fatally flawed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>We see no merit in the second and third
    submissions.  We agree with the trial judges ruling admitting S.K.s
    statements to her grandparents for their truth.  The instruction on those
    statements was adequate and there was no objection to it at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>We are, however, satisfied that the
    first ground of appeal must succeed. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber>CONVICTION APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Relying on the decision of this court
    in </span><em>R. v. M.(B.)</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> (1998), 130 C.C.C.
    (3d) 353 and other cases to the same effect, the appellant argues the trial
    judge erred in law by failing to instruct the jury it could not use the
    evidence relating to one count as evidence on the other counts, or use the
    evidence relating to one set of allegations concerning one complainant as bad
    character or propensity evidence in its consideration of the allegations
    regarding the other complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In this case, the complainants
    allegations against the appellant were joined in one indictment.  The Crown did
    not bring a similar act application and the defence did not seek a severance. 
    Accordingly, the jury heard all the Crowns evidence in respect of all
    allegations in the same trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainants first disclosed the
    appellants abuse during a weekend visit with their paternal grandparents. 
    While S.K. and C.K. were watching television with their grandfather, S.K. described
    the appellants sexual abuse.  Within minutes, C.K. indicated that the
    appellant had sexually abused her too.  The core of the complainants
    descriptions of the sexual abuse was essentially identical.  Later, at their
    grandfathers request, the girls repeated their allegations to their
    grandmother.  When the police became involved shortly thereafter, both
    complainants provided videotaped statements in which they implicated the
    appellant in sexual abuse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>At trial, C.K. adopted her statement to
    the police and repeated her allegations of sexual abuse by the appellant.  S.K.
    also testified at trial.  However, she gave no evidence of any sexual
    misconduct by the appellant.  Pursuant to the trial judges ruling, S.K.s
    description of the appellants sexual conduct with her was led through the
    testimony of S.K.s paternal grandparents about S.K.s out-of-court statements
    to them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant also testified.  He
    denied any wrongdoing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In her charge, the trial judge gave
    neither of the warnings mandated by </span><em>M.(B.).</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>  Specifically, she did not instruct the jury that it was
    to consider each charge separately and not use evidence relating to one count
    as evidence on any of the other counts.  Nor did she tell the jury that it
    could not use the evidence on one count as proof that the appellant is the sort
    of person who would commit the offences charged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In this case, given the interrelated
    nature and timing of the young complainants disclosure of the appellants
    abuse to their grandparents, and the substantive similarity of their
    allegations, there was little danger that the jury would engage in the type of
    prohibited propensity reasoning contemplated in </span><em>M.(B.)</em>. <span
class=MsoPageNumber> See also </span><em>R. v. Rarru</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 165.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>However, in our view, there was a real
    danger that, absent the proper limiting instructions, the jury would engage in
    a global assessment of the complainants credibility on the sexual interference
    allegations.  This danger was heightened by the fact that the Crowns case in
    respect of S.K.s allegations depended entirely on hearsay, while the Crowns
    case pertaining to C.K.s allegations rested on her in court testimony. 
    Potentially, therefore, the Crowns case was much stronger in respect of C.K.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Where, as here, a case involves
    multiple counts of sexual abuse and multiple complainants, it is incumbent on
    the trial judge to warn the jury that it cannot use the evidence on all the
    counts to prove any one count: </span><em>M.(B.)</em>, <span
class=MsoPageNumber>at para. </span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=FR-CA>41; </span></span><em><span lang=FR-CA>R. v. H.(F.J.)</span></em><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=FR-CA> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 169, (Ont. C.A.),
    at para. </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>12.  As we have said, this did
    not occur here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Crown acknowledges on appeal that
    the cross-count instruction normally should be given.  However, Crown counsel argues
    that the adequacy of the jury charge must be assessed from a functional
    perspective to determine whether it properly equipped the jury to perform its
    task.  She contends that, in the unique circumstances of this case and when the
    charge is read as a whole, the jury would have understood that it could not
    consider the evidence of one complainant as corroborative of that of the other.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In support of this contention, Crown
    counsel relies on: i) the structure of the jury charge, in which the trial
    judge examined each count, and much of the evidence related to each count,
    separately and sequentially; ii) Crown counsels warning, in his closing
    address to the jury, against the use of evidence pertaining to one count as
    corroborative of the other counts; iii) the propensity instruction provided to
    the jury regarding the appellants criminal record; iv) the fact that the
    appellant was acquitted on the two assault charges, suggesting the jury
    considered the evidence on each count separately; and v) the appellants
    failure to request the limiting instruction in question and his related failure
    to object to its absence from the jury charge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>We accept that the jury charge must be
    read as a whole and from a functional perspective.  However, none of the
    factors identified by Crown counsel, either alone or cumulatively, cures the
    non-direction in this case.  Indeed, virtually all the factors relied on by the
    Crown, described above, were considered, and specifically rejected, by this
    court in </span><em>H.(F.J.)</em> <span class=MsoPageNumber>as insufficient to
    overcome the type of non-direction at issue here: </span><em>H.(F.J.)</em>,<span
class=MsoPageNumber> at para. 17 (regarding the structure and contents of the
    jury charge); at para. 20 (concerning warnings about the law provided by
    counsel in their closing addresses to the jury); and at paras. 22-23 (regarding
    the acquittal of an accused on some charges and his convictions on others, on a
    multi-count indictment).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In the circumstances of this case, the
    non-direction at issue is fatal to the sexual interference convictions.  As in</span><em> H.(F.J.)</em>, <span class=MsoPageNumber>the problem with the charge here, is
    its silence about what the jury could not do with the evidence of one
    complainant in relation to that of the other.  And, again as in</span><em> H.(F.J.)</em>,<span
class=MsoPageNumber> given the similarities between S.K.s and C.K.s
    allegations, there was a real danger that, absent adequate warning, the jury
    might improperly consider the evidence of one of the complainants as
    corroborative of that of the other.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>We are unable to conclude that there is
    no reasonable possibility that the jury could have returned different verdicts
    on the sexual interference charges.  Accordingly, this is not an appropriate
    case for application of the proviso.  See</span><em> H.(F.J.)</em>, <span
class=MsoPageNumber>at paras. 24-25.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber>Disposition</span></p>

    new trial is ordered on the two sexual interference counts.  In light of this
    disposition, we do not reach the appellants application for leave to appeal
    sentence.</span></p>
