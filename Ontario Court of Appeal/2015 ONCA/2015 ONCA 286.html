  <p class=Heard>Heard: March 3-4, 2015</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on February 18,
    2012 and the sentence imposed on June 8, 2012 by Justice Renee M. Pomerance of
    the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><strong>Benotto J.A:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Two men disappeared after last being seen or heard in the garage and
    backyard of a home in Windsor.  Their decomposed bodies were discovered many
    months later.  They had been beaten to death.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>  The appellant was convicted,
    along with his co-accused Timothy Carter, of murdering both men.  His position
    at trial – maintained on appeal - was that he was not present when the fatal
    beatings took place.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and Carter were convicted of second degree murder for the
    deaths of Peter Kambas and Vaois Koukousoulas. Carter’s appeal of his
    conviction and sentence was heard together with this appeal.  The reasons in
    both appeals are being released together.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The last place at which the two
    victims were seen or heard was Carter’s residence. There was no evidence of any
    other location at which the two victims were assaulted and killed. Therefore,
    the first question for the jury was whether the appellant was present at
    Carter’s residence at the time of the beatings.  </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The evidence relied on by the
    Crown to establish the appellant’s presence was – individually and collectively
    – so frail that a thorough judicial scrutiny is triggered.  When the evidence
    is examined through the lens of judicial experience, it is apparent that the
    fact-finding exercise applied by the jury was flawed in light of the
    unreasonable result it produced.   </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the following reasons, I would
    allow the appeal on the basis of an unreasonable verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW OF THE CROWN’S CASE</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The theory advanced by the Crown may
    be summarized as follows:  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kambas, Koukousoulas and the appellant were together at Kambas’s
    residence in the early morning hours of June 29, 2008.  The three then
    travelled by taxi - which had been summoned by the appellant - to Carter’s
    residence.  </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While at this residence, the victims – Kambas and Koukousoulas –
    were killed by Carter and the appellant.  Witnesses saw or heard portions of
    assaults which took place in the garage and backyard of Carter’s home.  One
    witness thought she had heard Kambas moaning in pain, and the appellant
    threatening him. Another witness saw a thin man being assaulted in the backyard
    by a larger man that resembled the appellant in some respects.  Yet another
    witness observed Carter in his garage telling a distraught Koukousoulas to shut
    up, while a silent and unmoving body lay on the floor.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Carter’s vehicle was seen leaving his residence later that
    morning and was absent for several hours.  The same day, Carter left town with
    his girlfriend, driving a stolen pickup truck rather than his own vehicle. 
    That very evening, a fire consumed Carter’s garage and vehicle. Dentures
    belonging to Kambas were located in the burned remains of Carter’s vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The skeletal remains of Kambas and Koukousoulas were discovered
    together some months later.</p>
  <p class=Heading>EVIDENCE OF THE EVENTS OF JUNE 28 AND 29, 2008</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On June 28, 2008, Timothy Carter
    was living with his girlfriend Krystal Hamelin and their three-month-old baby
    in a detached house in Windsor. A friend, Adelino Moreira, often slept in the
    house as well. Moreira was helping Carter build a garage in the backyard that
    faced onto a back alleyway. The backyard had a deck next to the house. An above-ground
    pool was situated between the deck and the garage.   </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In addition to Moreira, Carter’s
    friends included Kambas, Koukousoulas, George Mavrakakis, Dan Ross, and the
    appellant.  There was evidence that at least Carter, Moreira, and Kambas were
    in the drug dealing business. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The events of June 28 and the
    early morning hours of June 29 were the subject of evidence from Hamelin,
    Kambas’s girlfriend Mary McConnell, McConnell’s friend Manny Pereira, and
    Carter’s next-door neighbours Denisa Lamanna and Shawn Grubb.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Krystal Hamelin</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On June 28, 2008, Hamelin was at
    home with her baby.  Although she was regularly using cocaine at the time, she
    did not recall if she was using on that day. She did not drink alcohol that day
    or night. At some point in the afternoon or early evening, Hamelin spoke with
    Carter, who was on the back deck having a beer with the appellant and another
    man.  She could not recall hearing the appellant’s voice.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Hamelin described the appellant as
    of medium or average build (not heavy or skinny), bald, tattooed, with a goatee
    that was five to six inches long.  She did not know the third man but described
    him as bigger than Carter and the appellant, heavyset, in his forties, with a
    long, scruffy, “goatee-style” beard, “kind of [a] biker-looking type.”  The
    third man was wearing a hat so Hamelin did not know if he was bald. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At around 9 or 10 p.m., Moreira
    came into the house appearing agitated.  He asked Hamelin for the base to the
    baby monitor, which detected noise. He walked out the back door with it.
    Moreira came back inside, without the baby monitor, and barricaded the door.  
    It was not clear where Moreira put the base. After he returned, Moreira and
    Hamelin listened to the receiver portion of the baby monitor for 10 or 20
    minutes.  They heard nothing. Moreira left out the back door.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Sometime in the early morning
    hours of June 29, 2008, around 1 or 2 a.m., McConnell came to the door. 
    McConnell appeared upset. They had a brief conversation and McConnell left.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Hamelin then heard “what sounded
    like someone fighting” in the backyard.  She heard no voices, just noises like
    banging or rustling. It sounded as though the fighting was coming from between
    the pool and garage.  She looked out the window but saw nothing.  She
    barricaded the door with a piece of wood, just as Moreira had done earlier.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Hamelin turned on the baby
    monitor.  She heard what sounded to be Kambas’s voice in pain, grunting and
    groaning.  She recognized Kambas’s voice because she had heard it at least 50
    times before; he had a rough, raspy, “sandpaperish-type of voice” and a Greek
    accent.  She also expected Kambas to be in the backyard or garage as Kambas was
    the person Moreira had been afraid of earlier. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>She then heard a voice say, “Keep
    your voice down.  Shut up or I’ll stomp your head.” The voice was speaking over
    the moaning. It spoke for anywhere from four to ten seconds. There was static
    on the baby monitor.  Hamelin agreed that voices heard over the baby monitor
    were not as clear as over a cell phone. She had a head cold at the time, but it
    was possible she was using cocaine that day.  Hamelin turned the monitor off
    because she was scared.  </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Hamelin testified that she
    recognized the threatening voice as the appellant’s.  It sounded like the appellant’s
    voice because it was loud, deep and obnoxious.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Hamelin admitted not liking the
    appellant. She could not recall ever speaking directly to the appellant,
    including on the phone.  She had heard his voice when she and Carter would go
    out to bars with the appellant and his girlfriend, Teri Brinn.  During these
    times, music would be playing and Hamelin would be using alcohol and cocaine. 
    She would talk with Brinn and Carter, but not the appellant. There were
    probably three occasions when they went out together, with the last occasion
    being possibly three to five years before June 2008. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Hamelin’s certainty that she heard
    the appellant’s voice had wavered in the lead-up to trial.  In September 2009,
    she had given a statement to Crown counsel that the voice could have been
    anyone else.  On re-examination, Hamelin said that she changed her story in
    September 2009 because she was scared.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>After speaking to him on the deck
    in the afternoon or early evening of June 28, 2008, Hamelin did not see Carter
    until around 9 a.m. the next morning when he returned to the house and
    suggested that they go on a vacation.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Mary McConnell</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mary McConnell was Kambas’s
    girlfriend.  At about 9:30 p.m. on June 28, 2008, Kambas and Koukousoulas were
    with her at the bar where she worked.   At some point, Kambas and Koukousoulas
    left.  At about 2 a.m., Kambas called McConnell and asked for a ride to
    Carter’s residence. He was still with Koukousoulas. She told him she would not
    pick him up at home.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>She expected that Kambas would
    come to the bar when her shift ended, but he did not arrive.   McConnell
    telephoned Kambas at 2:37 a.m. and 2:51 a.m. In at least one of those calls,
    Kambas told her that he was already at Carter’s and to come pick him up.   McConnell
    was alarmed when she overheard Kambas ask someone else, “What are you talking
    about?  You don’t trust me.”</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span

    court summarized the approach to be taken to the standard of proof in a case
    such as this one:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>When arguments are advanced, as here, that individual items of
    circumstantial evidence are explicable on bases other than guilt, it is
    essential to keep in mind that it is, after all, the cumulative effect of all
    the evidence that must satisfy the standard of proof required of the Crown.
    Individual items of evidence are links in the chain of ultimate proof: <em>R.
    v. Morin</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345 (S.C.C.), at p. 361. Individual items of
    evidence are not to be examined separately and in isolation, then cast aside if
    the ultimate inference sought from their accumulation does not follow from each
    individual item alone. It may be and very often is the case that items of
    evidence adduced by the Crown, examined separately, have not a very strong
    probative value. But all the evidence has to be considered, each item in
    relation to the others and to the evidence as a whole, and it is all of them
    taken together that may constitute a proper basis for a conviction: <em>R. v.
    Côté</em> (1941), 77 C.C.C. 75 (S.C.C.), at p. 76.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>When these legal principles are applied to the
    evidence relied on by the Crown to prove the identity of the appellant as a perpetrator,
    I find that the verdict is unreasonable.  There is no evidence upon which a
    jury acting judicially could reasonably have been satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant was one of the persons who caused the deaths of Kambas

    table at Kambas’s apartment in combination with the cellphone records suggests
    that the appellant was drinking with Kambas and Koukousoulas in the early hours
    of June 29, 2008, before Kambas, and presumably Koukousoulas, departed for
    Carter’s residence. The appellant’s presence at Kambas’s apartment when
    combined with the call from his phone to the taxi company and the dispatch of a
    driver to Kambas’s apartment, is capable of supporting an inference that the

    of the third passenger did not correspond to the appellant’s appearance.
    Further, the DNA evidence indicated that a fourth man may have been present in

    resemblance to the third passenger Seguin originally described to the police. 
    Although Seguin testified in-chief that the third passenger was “bald” and
    “husky”, he reasonably agreed that his memory of this man’s appearance would
    have been much better at his June 30, 2008, and July 5, 2008, police interviews
    when he described the third passenger as 5’10”, thinly built and elderly.  Seguin’s
    descriptions given in the two early police interviews bore no relationship to
    the appellant’s appearance.  These descriptions made no note of two of the
    appellant’s most distinctive features at the time: he was bald and had a very

  <p class=CQuote>[T]he facial hair matched my recollection of the bigger
    gentleman who was having his way physically in the altercation with the skinnier
    gentleman.  And also, I was holding [the photograph] at a distance ‘cuz I saw

    silhouette and I was judging proportionally neck, shoulders, head, ‘cuz that’s
    really all I could see in – in the photo, and I was closing my eyes and trying
    to recollect the proportions of the gentleman I saw that night.  So, I was

    these questions by the trial Crown, Grubb’s evidence could only establish that:

    recollection” of the facial hair on the assailant in Carter’s backyard; and
    (ii) the proportions of the appellant’s head and shoulders in the photograph
    matched those of the assailant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, Grubb’s evidence was no more than resemblance evidence which has
    little probative value: “As a general rule, a resemblance, without more, does
    not amount to an identification”: <em>R. v. Rybak</em>, 2008 ONCA 354, 90 O.R.
    (3d) 81, at para. 121, leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 311. 
    Indeed, “[i]n the absence of some other inculpatory evidence, a resemblance is
    no evidence”: <em>R. v. Boucher</em> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 52, at para. 19
    (Ont. C.A.).  I agree with the appellant’s submission that the other evidence
    relied upon by the Crown is so lacking in probative value that it fails to
    satisfy the test in <em>Rybak</em> and <em>Boucher</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if Grubb’s evidence is categorized as identification evidence, absent
    additional evidence supporting the identification, it is too frail to support the
    proposition that it was the appellant who was present in Carter’s backyard and
    a party to the beatings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to the propriety of the question.  The appellant, relying on <em>R. v. Tat </em>(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), submits that Grubb’s testimony as to the
    video in which Grubb perused the photo line-up was inadmissible in its entirety.</p>

    issue.  Even assuming all of his testimony was admissible, Grubb’s evidence is of
    little value.  He saw a person with facial hair and upper body proportions
    resembling that of the appellant in Carter’s backyard.  There was evidence from
    Hamelin of other men acquainted with Carter that had goatees. As a matter of
    everyday human experience, goatees and upper body proportions are not so
    uncommon or distinctive as to be capable of identifying an individual.  Grubb’s
    description of the assailant at trial does not match the photograph of the
    appellant in that the appellant was totally bald - he did not have very short,
    brown hair. Grubb’s description of the assailant’s hair and build was contrary
