style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown appeals from the respondent's acquittals for
    several sexual offences alleged to have been committed against the respondents
    niece between 1989 and 1994. </span><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the oral appeal hearing, we ordered that the Crown
    appeal be allowed, that the acquittals be set aside, and that a new trial,
    including a new <em>voir dire</em>, be held. These are our reasons for that
    order.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In pre-trial rulings, the trial judge found that an inculpatory
    statement made by the respondent to the police was inadmissible as evidence at
    trial. The trial judge concluded that, in taking the statement, the police
    breached the respondents ss. 10(a) and 10(b) <em>Charter</em> rights and his
    s. 7 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>right to silence. Relying on his s. 7 <em>Charter </em>ruling,
    the trial judge also found the statement involuntary. Because the statement was
    involuntary, it was unnecessary for the trial judge to conduct a s. 24(2) <em>Charter</em> analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the complainant and the respondent testified at trial. Although the
    trial judge said he had no reason to doubt the complainants evidence, the
    respondents evidence left him with a reasonable doubt. He accordingly
    acquitted the respondent on all charges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Crown challenges a preliminary evidentiary ruling made by
    the trial judge on the pre-trial motions, as well as the trial judges ss. 7,
    and 10(b) <em>Charter</em> rulings and his finding that the respondents
    statement to the police was involuntary. For reasons that we will explain, we
    accept the Crowns submission that the trial judge erred in law in his
    preliminary evidentiary ruling and in his ruling concerning the admissibility
    of the respondents inculpatory statement.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The trial judges preliminary evidentiary ruling</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent initially pleaded guilty to one of the charges but then applied successfully to have his guilty plea struck. During pre-trial motions at his ensuing trial, the respondent asked that a pre-sentence report prepared following his guilty plea be admitted to prove the truth of the contents of certain statements and documents referred to in the pre-sentence report concerning his developmental deficits. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The statements and documents in the pre-sentence report
    on which the respondent sought to rely included a statement by the respondents
    mother that the respondent was assessed and labelled as mentally retarded
    during his school years. They also included documents located in an historical
    file indicating the following: testing revealed that the respondents
    intellectual functioning was in the borderline normal range; doctors with whom
    the respondent had had consultations referred to him as a retarded boy; and
    other reports referred to the respondents developmental delay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge ruled the pre-sentence report
    admissible to prove the truth of the content of these statements and documents on
    three bases</span>:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the common law public documents exception;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the principled approach to the hearsay rule (which the trial judge referred
    to as the <em>Khan </em>exception); and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the trial judges residual discretion to prevent unfairness to the
    accused that would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept the Crowns submission that the trial judge erred in law in
    admitting the pre-sentence report to prove the truth of the contents of the
    above noted statements and documents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    admitting the pre-sentence report based on the common law public documents
    exception and the <em>Khan </em>exception, the trial judge relied in part on
    his understanding that the Crown had conceded the reliability of the various
    statements and reports. On appeal, it is not disputed that no such concession
    was made. The trial judge did not conduct his own reliability analysis. His failure
    to do so is an error in law that negates the first two bases for his admissibility
    ruling. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, we also conclude that the trial judges reliance on the common law
    public documents exception to the hearsay rule is misplaced. A pre-sentence report
    is prepared on the basis that it is relevant to issues surrounding sentencing <em>following</em><i> </i>a finding of guilt, and it is not subject to the same evidentiary
    strictures as are in place at trial. Witness statements and medical reports recorded
    or referred to in a pre-sentence report are not rendered admissible for the
    truth of their contents at trial by virtue of their inclusion in that report.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is especially the case where double hearsay is at issue. The trial judges
    reliance on the public documents exception to ground the admissibility of the
    respondents mothers hearsay statements about the respondents intellectual
    abilities and related documents is an error in law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judges conclusion that the admission of this evidence was necessary
    lacked any evidentiary foundation and was also an error in law. Because the
    respondent failed to demonstrate any basis for concluding that the admission of
    the evidence was necessary, the trial judge erred in principle in relying on
    his residual discretion to admit the evidence.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge ruling concerning
    the admissibility of the respondents statement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also accept the Crowns submission that the trial judge erred in law in his s.
    7 <em>Charter</em> analysis concerning whether the police breached the respondents
    right to silence based on persistent questioning by the police during the
    course of a videotaped statement in which the respondent acknowledged two of
    the alleged sexual acts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent attended the police station and gave the videotaped statement in
    response to a request from an officer who told the respondent he was
    investigating a sexual assault allegation in which the respondent was a
    possible suspect. At the outset of the interview, the officer cautioned the
    respondent to disregard any threats or promises made by other officers to
    induce him to speak and told him, Its up to you if you want to talk, okay? The
    officer also informed the respondent that he had a right to contact a lawyer
    and facilitated contact with duty counsel through the 1-800 number at the
    respondents request.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of police questioning, the appellant made a variety of statements
    concerning his willingness to speak. For example: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>when asked if he was curious about the allegations, he said no
    but also indicated he would not mind talking about it another day; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>after discussing some recollections about interactions with the
    complainant and being encouraged by the officer to move forward and deal with

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    substance of the trial judges s. 7 <em>Charter</em> analysis is contained at
    paras. 46 and 47 of his ruling on the <em>voir dire</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The right to silence arises at the investigative stage. The
    police are not necessarily required to refrain from questioning a detainee who
    states that he does not wish to talk. However, under both common law and <i>Charter</i> rules, police persistence in continuing an interview, despite repeated
    assertions by the detainee that he wishes to remain silent, may well raise a
    strong argument that the subsequently obtained statement was not the product of
    a free will to speak to authorities, and it is not voluntary. The mere
    presence of a doubt as to the exercise of the detainees free will in making a
    statement will suffice to ground a remedy. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the circumstances of this case, I find that the accused was
    effectively denied his right to silence in breach of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    persistent police questioning to constitute a breach of a detainees right to
    silence, it must have the consequence of depriving the detainee of the right to
    choose whether or not to speak to the police. This is made clear in<i> <em>R. v.
    Singh</em></i>, 2007 SCC 48, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405. In <em>Singh</em>, at para.
    46, the Supreme Court articulated this requirement in a quotation from <em>R.
    v. Hebert</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>there is nothing in the rule to prohibit the police from
    questioning the accused in the absence of counsel after the accused has
    retained counsel. Presumably, counsel will inform the accused of the right to
    remain silent. If the police are not posing as undercover officers and the
    accused chooses to volunteer information, there will be no violation of the <em>Charter</em>. <em>Police persuasion, short of denying the suspect the right to choose or depriving
    him of an operating mind, does not breach the right to silence</em>. [Emphasis
    added].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>Further, at para. 53 of <em>Singh</em>, the Court
    stated: The ultimate question is whether the accused exercised free will by
    choosing to make a statement.</p>

    whether persistent police questioning will result in a breach of a detainees

    did not engage in any analysis of whether the respondents statements during
    the interview amounted to repeated assertions  that he wishe[d] to remain

    in both </span><em>Singh</em><span style='line-height:200%'> and </span><em>Hebert</em><span

    persuasion, the trial judge failed to advert to and apply the proper test

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span

    the trial judge's s. 7 ruling formed the basis of his finding that the respondent's statement was involuntary, the error in his s. 7 analysis taints his conclusion on involuntariness.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent concedes that the trial judge erred in finding a s. 10(b) <em>Charter </em>breach. He also acknowledges that the s. 10(a) <em>Charter</em> breach
    found by the trial judge would not warrant the exclusion of the appellants
    statement to the police under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. We agree with
    these concessions.</p>
