  <p class=Nameofcounsel>John McInnes, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard: April 28, 2015</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on July 24, 2013 by
    Justice Sheffield of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted by a judge sitting without a jury of sexual
    assault and sexual touching of his daughter when she was 8 and 9 years old. He
    was also found guilty of simple assault with respect to a spanking incident
    that occurred around the same time. The appellant appealed only the sexual
    offence convictions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was 15 years old at the time of trial. She described
    incidents that she said occurred six and seven years earlier when the appellant
    would visit her and her sister on Saturday nights at the home of his second
    spouse and her children, where the complainant and her sister would visit as
    well.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On those occasions the complainant and her sister would sleep on
    mattresses on the floor with about one foot of space in between. The appellant
    would come and lie down between them in that one-foot space. They would then
    watch movies. Sometimes he would cuddle the complainant but sometimes he would
    rub her vagina and her breasts. When she told him she did not like that, he
    responded that she did. This occurred between 5 and 20 times.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified. He agreed that he would lie down between the
    children and watch movies and that he would sometimes cuddle the complainant,
    but he denied the allegations of sexual impropriety.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of grounds of appeal were raised by counsel on behalf of the
    appellant. The court did not call on the Crown on all grounds. In light of our
    conclusion that the appeal must succeed on the <i>R. v. <em>W.(D.)</em></i> ground and that a new trial must be ordered, it is unnecessary to address the
    other grounds raised.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for judgment, having found the complainant to be
    believable and reliable, the trial judge referred to the rule in <i>R. v. <em>W.(D.)</em></i>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, stating correctly that the <em>W.(D.)</em> test requires
    that judges and juries refrain from engaging in credibility contests between
    the accused and the complainant. He went on to state that the court is
    required to assess the totality of the evidence and on that basis determine
    whether any doubt remains, in which case the accused is given the benefit of
    that doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After discussing the evidence given by the appellant, the trial judge
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>While I am not prepared to say that
    his evidence is wholly incredible and unreliable, I nonetheless find that on
    matters germane to the question of whether he touched his daughter in a sexual
    context, I find his evidence to be less credible than that of the complainant.
    As such, he has failed to raise a reasonable doubt in my mind with respect to
    those offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He then went on to find that the appellant was deliberate in his timing
    of the sexual assaults comfortable in the knowledge that his actions would go
    undetected by the other sleeping children, and rejected the appellants
    testimony that he was not adversely under the influence of alcohol when in
    charge of the children, based on some photographs of him drinking in their
    presence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After acknowledging that the complainant has lived a troubled life, he
    stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Yet, on the whole of the evidence, I found her evidence to be
    the more credible and persuasive. I found the straight denial by the accused
    less credible, less reliable and therefore, of little probative weight.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel fairly acknowledged that the two quoted statements, viewed in
    isolation, were erroneous formulations of the burden of proof, but submitted
    that when the reasons are read as a whole, the court could find that the trial
    judge applied the correct burden of proof to the finding of guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    cannot accept that submission. The Crown relies on this courts decision in <i>R.
    v. <em>J.J.R.D.</em></i><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (2006), 215 C.C.C.
    (3d) 252</span></em> (Ont. C.A.), where Doherty J.A. explained that it was not
    an error for a trial judge to reject an accuseds evidence based on a
    considered and reasoned acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of the truth of
    conflicting credible evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    important difference between the reasons for judgment in this case and in <em>J.J.R.D.</em> is that while in the reasons in this case, the trial judge also discussed why
    he accepted the evidence of the complainant, despite the fact that she had
    earlier denied any sexual misconduct to the police, and why he rejected the
    denial by the appellant, he then made the two impugned statements about whose
    evidence he preferred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    two statements indicate clearly that despite the reference to <em>W.(D.)</em>,
    the trial judge engaged in a credibility contest, making his decision on which
    version he believed based on whose evidence he preferred, rather than by
    addressing the problems and inconsistencies in the evidence tendered by the
    Crown and determining and articulating why they did not raise a reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, although there are other passages in the reasons for judgment that
    demonstrate a proper approach, one cannot be satisfied, reading the reasons as
    a whole, that the trial judge did not ultimately use the erroneous burden of
    proof to convict the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the reasons disclose an error of law, the verdict must be set aside and a new
    trial ordered.</p>
