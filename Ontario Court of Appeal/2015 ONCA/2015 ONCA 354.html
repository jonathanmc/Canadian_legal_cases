  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice William
    B. Horkins of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated June 24, 2013, with reasons
    reported at 2013 ONCJ 434.</p>
  <p class=Judge><span lang=FR-CA>H.S. LaForme J.A.:</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Toronto Anti-Violence
    Intervention Strategy (“TAVIS”) is a community policing program within the
    Toronto Police Service. TAVIS police officers engage in what is referred to as pro-active
    policing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Among other practices, TAVIS
    police officers randomly approach people and engage them in conversation, which
    may reveal information of a general or investigative interest. The police in
    these encounters usually fill out a Field Investigative Report (an “FIR” or
    “208 card”) with identification and association information. The police use 208
    cards to build and maintain a database of individuals and their associates,
    primarily in high-crime or so-called “priority” areas of the city.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The issues in this appeal arise
    out of an engagement between a TAVIS police officer and the appellant and the
    circumstances under which the officer filled out a 208 card. During the
    engagement, exigent circumstances were said to have arisen that justified a
    warrantless search for public and/or officer safety. The appellant argues the
    circumstances did not justify the warrantless search, and that this court
    should therefore exclude the evidentiary products of the search. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant and another young
    black male were walking past a police car when Constable Ryan Fardell singled
    out the appellant and called him over for questioning. Constable Fardell first
    clarified the appellant’s identity and asked whether he had any outstanding
    warrants. Once Constable Fardell established the appellant’s identity and
    realized he had no outstanding warrants, Constable Fardell turned to filling
    out a 208 card.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As Constable Fardell wrote up the
    card, a third man, apparently unknown to either the appellant or the officer,
    walked up behind Constable Fardell and his partner and began interrogating the
    officers about what he perceived to be harassment of the appellant and the
    appellant’s companion.&nbsp;The appellant abruptly turned sideways, “blading”<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> his body. Constable Fardell commanded the appellant to show his hands, but the
    appellant failed to do so. Constable Fardell then reached out and patted the
    appellant’s side. The officer felt a hard object and yelled “gun”. The
    appellant fled, and a gun fell out of his jacket as he mounted a fence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The police apprehended the
    appellant shortly thereafter. He was ultimately convicted of possession of a
    firearm and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Trial Judge’s Decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant’s trial was heard as
    an application to exclude the firearm for breaches of the appellant’s </span><em>Charter </em><span style='line-height:200%'>rights: </span><em>R. v. Fountain</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, 2013 ONCJ 434, 291 C.R.R. (2d) 299. The trial judge
    held that, while the appellant had been arbitrarily detained, the subsequent
    pat-down search was reasonable because it flowed from exigent circumstances.
    The trial judge then concluded that even if the gun’s discovery stemmed from
    the arbitrary detention such that the gun was “obtained in a manner” that
    infringed the appellant’s </span><em>Charter</em><span style='line-height:200%'> rights, he would not exclude the gun as evidence under s. 24(2) of the </span><em>Charter</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As the trial judge observed, while
    pro-active policing programs have generally passed </span><em>Charter</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> scrutiny, the courts must assess each street-level
    encounter on its own merits. There is no doubt, he cautioned, “that these
    carding programs tread a very fine line depending on the particular
    circumstance of any given situation”: </span><em>Fountain</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, at para. 9.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant asserts that in this
    case, the line was crossed.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>THE ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant raises two issues on
    appeal. First, he submits that the trial judge erred in applying the doctrine
    of exigent circumstances to justify the pat-down search. Second, he argues that
    the trial judge failed to assess material inconsistencies in the evidence that
    damaged Constable Fardell’s credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that if Constable
    Fardell unlawfully searched the appellant, the court should conduct a fresh s.
    24(2) analysis and exclude the gun. If the trial judge erred in his assessment
    of Constable Fardell’s credibility, the court should order a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I conclude that the appellant was
    unlawfully detained throughout his involvement with the police and that exigent
    circumstances justified the pat-down search of the appellant. The trial judge
    was right to proceed to a s. 24(2) analysis in the circumstances of this case.
    I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On the first issue, the appellant
    argues that exigent circumstances cannot justify the search of the appellant
    because the police were not in the lawful execution of their duties at the
    time. He also contends that where, as here, the police created the exigent
    circumstances, they cannot rely on those circumstances to justify a search.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On the second issue, the appellant
    submits the trial judge erred in failing to reconcile material inconsistencies
    in the evidence. Had the trial judge properly assessed the inconsistencies, he
    might have come to a different conclusion on Constable Fardell’s credibility
    and so on the lawfulness of the pat-down search. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I will address each of these
    issues in order.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Issue 1: Exigent Circumstances</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant asserts that from
    the moment Constable Fardell began speaking to him until the search, the police
    were arbitrarily detaining him and not engaged in the lawful execution of their
    duties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It is unclear to me from the trial
    judge’s reasons when he finds the unlawful detention began. In my view,
    Constable Fardell unlawfully detained the appellant from the moment he called
    out to him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Constable Fardell had dealt with
    the appellant or his brother before. The officer knew they both had criminal
    histories and believed that a warrant was out for one of them. The trial judge
    found that, although Constable Fardell was acting within the general scope of
    his duties as a police officer, this was not a “random stop”. Rather, it was a
    “focused, investigative engagement” to determine if the appellant was the
    wanted brother.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Constable Fardell admitted that he
    had no basis to detain the appellant when he began speaking to him. The officer
    only thought the appellant might be the brother who might be wanted. He did not
    suspect that the appellant was involved in any particular criminal activity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge found that
    Constable Fardell had psychologically detained the appellant. Constable
    Fardell, as a uniformed officer, ordered the appellant, a young, black man, to
    come over and talk to him. The officer asked the appellant if he had any open
    warrants, and planned to arrest the appellant if he did. He told the appellant
    to keep his hands down. He did not tell the appellant that he was free to
    leave. The trial judge inferred that, in all these circumstances, a reasonable
    person would have felt compelled to obey the officer and felt that he could not
    walk away: see </span><em>R. v. Grant</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, 2009
    SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 31. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I agree with the trial judge’s
    inference. Therefore, I conclude that Constable Fardell unlawfully detained the
    appellant from the outset of their conversation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In any case, the Crown accepts
    that, at some point before the third-party intervention, Constable Fardell
    unlawfully detained the appellant. Therefore, I will focus my analysis on two
    issues: (a) the lawfulness of the pat-down search, and (b) the exclusion of the
    gun.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Lawfulness of the Search </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Warrantless searches are
    presumptively unreasonable: </span><em>R. v. Mann</em><span style='line-height:
200%'>, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para. 36. But a warrantless safety
    search may be reasonable in appropriate circumstances: see </span><em>R. v.
    MacDonald</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, 2014 SCC 3, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 37,
    at para. 31. A safety search is generally “a reactionary measure”, often
    “driven by exigent circumstances”: </span><em>MacDonald</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, at para. 32. For a safety search to be lawful, an
    officer must “have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an imminent
    threat” to police or public safety: </span><em>MacDonald</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, at para. 43. As </span><em>MacDonald</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> described, at para. 41: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given the high privacy interests at stake in such searches, [a
    safety search] will be authorized by law only if the police officer believes on
    reasonable grounds that his or her safety is at stake and that, as a result, it
    is necessary to conduct a search. The legality of the search therefore turns on
    its reasonable, objectively verifiable necessity in the circumstances of the
    matter. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A safety search must also be carried
    out reasonably: </span><em>MacDonald</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, at
    para. 47. Finally, even if a safety search takes place in the context of an
    unlawful detention, exigent circumstances can still justify the search: see </span><em>R.
    v. Blackwood</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, [2009] O.J. No. 5393 (S.C.),
    aff’d 2013 ONCA 219, [2013] O.J. No. 1548. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Often, police officers conduct safety
    searches incident to investigative detentions. However, </span><em>MacDonald </em><span
style='line-height:200%'>demonstrates that an officer may conduct a safety

    judge erred in relying on exigent circumstances to justify the search because
    “[t]he police cannot justify a warrantless search on the basis of a volatile

    easily tell, in all the circumstances of this case, whether Constable Fardell
    had detained the appellant or, if he had detained the appellant, whether the
    detention was lawful. I cannot say with any degree of certainty that Constable
    Fardell’s unlawful detention of the appellant caused the third party to
    intervene. The third party would likely still have intervened even if Constable
    Fardell had not detained the appellant or if he had lawfully detained the

    rely on the third party interjection alone to find exigent circumstances The
    appellant’s reaction to the appearance of the third party was equally if not
    more important to Constable Fardell’s decision to search the appellant. Constable
    Fardell said that once the third party arrived, the appellant became nervous,
    “bladed” his body, placed his left arm on his left hip, and took two paces
    backwards. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>where the accused aggressively pushed a police
    officer, I am satisfied that Constable Fardell had reasonable grounds to
    conduct the pat-down search. Because the third party may have interjected even
    if the police had not unlawfully detained the appellant and because the
    appellant’s reaction played a central role in producing the exigent

    err in applying the doctrine of exigent circumstances to justify the search of
    the appellant. The trial judge was entitled to conclude that Constable Fardell
    had reasonable grounds to believe the appellant presented an imminent threat to
    his safety. Furthermore, Constable Fardell carried out the pat-down search of
    the appellant’s left hip in a reasonable manner. The officer merely patted the

  <p class=CQuote>The jurisprudence establishes a generous approach to the
    threshold issue. A causal relationship between the breach and the impugned
    evidence is not necessary. The evidence will be &quot;obtained in a
    manner&quot; that infringed a <em>Charter</em> right if on a review of the
    entire course of events, the breach and the obtaining of the evidence can be
    said to be part of the same transaction or course of conduct. The connection
    between the breach and the obtaining of the evidence may be temporal,
    contextual, causal or a combination of the three. The connection must be more
    than tenuous.</p>

    unlawfully detained the appellant and discovered the gun as “part of the same
    transaction or course of conduct”. The most compelling factor is the temporal

    three minutes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    to S.C.C. requested. In </span><em>Stevenson</em><span style='line-height:200%'>,
    the appellant had been convicted of shooting his estranged wife in the head.
    Doherty J.A. concluded the appellant was arbitrarily detained when the police
    arrested him without reasonable grounds. The police had put handcuffs on him
    and then wrapped his hands in plastic to preserve possible gunshot residue. Later
    the same evening, reasonable grounds to arrest the appellant arose, turning his
    unlawful arrest into a lawful arrest. After the arrest became lawful, the
    police searched (i.e. tested) the appellant’s hands and discovered gunshot
    residue. </span></p>

    the eventual search of the appellant’s hands occurred </span><em>after</em><span

    arbitrary detention was sufficiently connected to the discovery of the gunshot
    residue to require a s. 24(2) analysis. At para. 63, he explained: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The appellant seeks the exclusion of the results of the GSR
    test done on his clothing and hands. The GSR results are <span class=Underline>sufficiently
    temporally connected</span> to the arbitrary detention to make the results of
    the test &quot;evidence that was obtained in a manner that infringed&quot; the
    appellant's <em>Charter</em> rights even though he was lawfully arrested by the
    time the samples were taken and the clothing seized. [Emphasis added; citations

    because the circumstances are similar to those in this case. In both cases, a lawful
    search was linked to an unlawful detention. That the facts in </span><em>Stevenson</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> required a s. 24(2) analysis leads me to the
    conclusion that this case’s facts also require such an analysis.</span></p>

    party’s arrival, “there was no indication that the officer had any intention,
    or interest, in actually arresting Mr. Fountain let alone in searching him”. Because
    of this, any causal connection between the unlawful detention in this case and
    the discovery of the gun appears weak. But, “[a] causal relationship between
    the breach and the impugned evidence is not necessary”: <em>Plaha</em>, at
    para. 45. And, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>Strachan</em>, at p. 1002<span

  <p class=CQuote>A strict causal nexus would place the courts in the position of
