  <p class=Onappealfrom><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>By
    the Court:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals from her conviction for
    sexually assaulting a child of approximately five years old. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following a trial, the trial judge rejected the
    appellant's evidence and accepted the complainant's evidence that the appellant
    performed a single act of oral sex on her. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her reasons for finding the appellant guilty,
    the trial judge relied, in part, on the unlikelihood that a young child would
    have the knowledge the complainant displayed about oral sex and on the absence
    of any evidence at trial concerning any source of such knowledge other than the
    conduct of the appellant complained of by the child.  At para. 224 of her
    reasons, the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[The complainant] was able to tell and show [the
    police officer who conducted the complainant's videotaped interview] what [the
    appellant] did to her and how she licked her vagina with her tongue. The fact
    that [the complainant] was caught showing Z, her 4 year old cousin, how to lick
    her vagina although not determinative that it was because of what the [the appellant]
    had done to [the complainant], corroborates that [the complainant] had seen or
    had the act performed on her prior to July 2009. </span><em>There is no
    evidence before the court that [the complainant] would have seen or experienced
    the act other than the one time with [the appellant]. It is obviously not
    something one would expect to be within a 6 year old child's knowledge and
    especially in [a] family where sex was not even discussed. There was no evidence
    that [the complainant] had seen similar activity in her home, on TV or anywhere
    else, other than [the appellant] licking her vagina</em><span lang=EN-US>.
    [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the appellant argues that the Crown
    did not contend at trial that a young child would have no knowledge of the
    sexual activity at issue. The appellant therefore submits that, to the extent the
    trial judge considered this a live issue, the trial judge erred in dismissing the
    appellants application under s. 276 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-US> to cross-examine the complainant in relation to prior sexual
    activity, or, in the alternative, in failing to permit the appellant to re-open
    her s.&nbsp;276 application once the trial judge determined that the complainants
    knowledge about oral sex was a live issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her s. 276 application, the appellant sought
    leave to cross-examine the complainant on, or lead evidence about, three
    incidents of alleged prior sexual activity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In oral argument on appeal, the appellant
    acknowledged that the conduct allegedly involved in the first two incidents was
    not sufficiently similar to the conduct forming the subject matter of the
    offence to warrant a s. 276 order permitting that evidence to be led. She
    therefore abandoned any reliance on the first two incidents and confined her submissions
    to the third incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The third incident involved an interaction
    between the complainant, when she was about six, and the complainant's cousin Z.,
    when Z. was about four. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her s. 276 application, the appellant alleged
    that Z.'s mother caught Z. &quot;licking the complainant's privates&quot;.
    Further, the appellant alleged that the complainants mother became very angry
    when she learned about the incident and that the complainant disclosed her
    allegations against the appellant to her mother as a result of being
    disciplined by her mother.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During submissions on the s. 276 application, defence
    counsel for the appellant (not Ms. Thomas) clarified that she intended to
    cross-examine the complainant about a motive to fabricate arising from the incident
    with Z.  In her ruling on the application, the trial judge noted that defence
    counsel &quot;stated several times there is no intention to cross-examine on
    the actual activity but simply on the consequences of being caught engaging in
    the activity.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her ruling on the s. 276 application, the
    trial judge held that the complainant could be cross-examined as to &quot;the
    consequences of being caught and whether she was punished and if she was
    punished and what impact that had on her reporting the allegations concerning
    the [appellant].&quot;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the appellant submits that, the trial
    judge's ruling on the s. 276 application created unfairness because the trial
    judge prohibited cross-examination on the incident with Z., yet relied on the absence
    of evidence at trial of any other source for the complainant's knowledge of
    oral sex to support a conviction. The appellant submits that cross-examination
    of the complainant about the incident may have revealed that Z. was actually the
    source of the complainant's knowledge about oral sex.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not accept these submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant's argument that the trial judge
    should have permitted cross-examination of the complainant at trial to show
    that the complainant may have learned about oral sex from Z. is raised for the
    first time on appeal and is contrary to the position taken by the appellant at
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the appellant's position was premised
    on the theory that the complainant was the instigator of the incident with Z.
    When cross-examining the complainant at trial, defence counsel asked the
    complainant why she had dared Z. to lick her. The appellant does not suggest on
    appeal that this question lacked a proper foundation.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the formal s. 276 application was
    framed as a request to cross-examine on the incident, defence counsel did not
    pursue that request on the application. Instead, as mentioned above, defence
    counsel repeatedly stated that she intended to limit cross-examination to
    questions about Z.s motive to fabricate.  Since the trial judge was not asked
    to permit cross-examination on the incident, in our view, she made no error in
    failing to permit it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, in the face of the defence position at
    trial that the complainant was the instigator of the incident with Z., we see
    no error in the trial judges reliance on the absence of evidence at trial that
    the complainant would have seen or experienced oral sex other than the one time
    with the appellant and on the unlikelihood that a young child would have any
    knowledge about oral sex. As noted above, defence counsel at trial suggested in
    cross-examination that the complainant dared Z. to lick her privates and did

    foundation at trial for what happened during the incident with Z. came from the
    complainants assertion in her videotaped statement to police, which she
    adopted at trial, and from the testimony of the complainants mother. In her
    videotaped statement, the complainant told police that Z. had licked her
    private and that she got in trouble. The complainants mother testified that,
    on the day in question, she heard Z.s mother scream, and she went upstairs to see
    what was going on. She found Z. squatted down and crying kind of in front of
    her daughter. Her daughter had no pants on. She was lifting up her pants and
    appeared embarrassed. The complainants mother also testified that Z.'s mother
    told her that the complainant was trying to get Z. to lick her vagina. Although
    the latter statement was hearsay, the complainants s. 276 application contains
    a statement that the complainant disclosed the details of the incident with Z.
    to her mother and a social worker on August 26, 2010. According to the s. 276
    application, the complainant advised these individuals that:</span></span></p>
