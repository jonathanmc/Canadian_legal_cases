  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Associate
    Chief Justice Frank N. Marrocco, Justices Sidney N. Lederman and Harriet E.
    Sachs), dated February 21, 2014, with reasons reported at 2014 ONSC 1012,
    dismissing an appeal from order of the Landlord and Tenant Board, dated June
    17, 2013.</p>
  <p class=Heading>By the Court:</p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the 1970s and 1980s, the Algoma Central Railway leased out a
    large number of one-acre cottage sites on property it owned north of Sault Ste.
    Marie. In 1997, the Railway sold the land to the appellant, 3011650 Nova Scotia
    Limited c.o.b. as Michipicoten Forest Resources (the “Landlord”). In 2005, the
    Landlord sold part of the land and cottage sites to Algoma Timberlakes Corp., retaining
    for itself a tract of land on which 435 cottage sites are located. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its 2010 decision in <em>Matthews v. Algoma Timberlakes Corp</em>.,<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> this court held that the <em>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</em> (the “<em>RTA</em>”)<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> applied to the cottage sites on the Timberlakes land.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The respondents are the tenants of three cottage sites located on the
    Landlord’s property. The respondents lease the cottage sites from the Landlord
    and they own the structures that they have built on the sites. The leases are
    each for a term of one year but renewable for 20 years. (The leased sites and
    the cottages built thereon collectively will be referred to as the “Cottages”.)
    In their Agreed Statement of Facts, the parties agreed that the Cottages on the
    Landlord’s property are similar to those located on the Timberlakes land
    considered by this court in <em>Matthews</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2012, the respondents applied to the Landlord and Tenant Board for
    rent rebates. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the Landlord acknowledged that the <em>Matthews</em> decision
    applied to the respondents’ Cottages, it argued that the <em>RTA</em> could not
    apply to them without rendering those tenancies void. The Landlord based its
    argument on the subdivision control provisions of the <em>Planning Act</em> (the “<em>PA</em>”). Specifically, the Landlord contended that although the
    leases were at most 20 years in duration, the security of tenure provisions of the <em>RTA</em> would extend the tenancy agreements for the Cottages beyond 21
    years, thereby contravening the subdivision control provisions of the <em>PA</em>,
    with the result that the tenancy agreements would not “create or convey any
    interest in land”: <em>PA</em> s. 50(21). In order to avoid that result, the
    Landlord submitted that the Board should find that the respondents’ Cottages
    were not subject to the <em>RTA</em>, but to the <em>Commercial Tenancies Act</em>,<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> and dismiss their rent rebate applications.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board rejected the Landlord’s argument, holding that the respondents’
    tenancies were subject to the <em>RTA</em> and, based on its interpretation of
    s. 50(3) of the <em>PA</em>, their leases were not void under the <em>PA</em>.
    It ordered the Landlord to rebate to the respondents part of the rent they had
    paid for 2011 and 2012. The Divisional Court dismissed the Landlord’s appeal.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> Leave to appeal to this court was granted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out below, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts are not in dispute. At the hearing before the Board, the
    parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts. As was the case in <em>Matthews</em>,
    the three one-acre sites leased by the respondents contain cottages built in
    the 1980s. Access to one Cottage was by road; to the other two Cottages, by
    boat or snowmobile. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the respondents’ original leases were with the Railway, in June
    2008, each of them entered into a new lease agreement with the Landlord. Each
    lease was for a term of one year, with an automatic right of renewal for nineteen
    further one-year terms, subject to a 30-day notice to terminate before each
    renewal.  The leases would terminate without any right of further renewal on
    the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the lease date.</p>
  <p class=Heading>HEARING BEFORE THE LANDLORD AND TENANT BOARD</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    135(1) of the <em>RTA</em> enables a tenant of a “rental unit” to apply to the
    Board for an order that the landlord repay any money collected in contravention
    of the <em>Act</em>. In March 2012, the three respondents each filed with the
    Board applications for rent rebates against the Landlord by using the
    standardized Form T1 entitled “Tenant Application for a Rebate.” The respondents
    argued in their applications that the Landlord had imposed unlawful rents for
    the years 2009 through 2011 and, as a result, had collected rents for those
    years in excess of the lawful rents permitted under the <em>RTA</em>. The respondents
    contended that the rent increases imposed by the Landlord were void. They
    sought rent rebates in the following amounts: (i) Nanne - $4,353.96; (ii)
    Pasternak - $3,903.99; and, (iii) Campbell - $3,175.83.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board held that the rents charged by the Landlord since 2008 were illegal and
    ordered the Landlord to pay the respondents rebates for the two years 2011 and
    2012 – the maximum period recoverable due to <em>RTA</em> s. 135(4) – specifically,
    rebates of $1,181.11 to Nanne, $1,083.19 to Pasternak, and $926.68 to Campbell.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the Board, the Landlord argued that although the leases for the three Cottages
    were for a term of no more than 20 years, the deemed renewal of term provision
    in <em>RTA</em>,<em> </em>s. 38(1) would transform them into leases of
    indefinite duration. <em>RTA</em> s. 38(1) provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>38. (1) If a tenancy agreement for a fixed term ends and has
    not been renewed or terminated, the landlord and tenant shall be deemed to have
    renewed it as a monthly tenancy agreement containing the same terms and
    conditions that are in the expired tenancy agreement and subject to any increases
    in rent charged in accordance with this Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Landlord argued that these leases would then contravene the subdivision control
    requirements of <em>PA</em> s. 50(3) which states:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;No person shall convey land by way of a deed or
    transfer, or grant, assign or exercise a power of appointment with respect to
    land, or mortgage or charge land, or enter into an agreement of sale and
    purchase of land or <span class=Underline>enter into any agreement that has the
    effect of granting the use of or right in land directly or by entitlement to renewal
    for a period of twenty-one years or more unless</span> …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) the grantor by deed or transfer, the person granting,
    assigning or exercising a power of appointment, the mortgagor or chargor, the
    vendor under an agreement of purchase and sale or the grantor of a use of or
    right in land, as the case may be, <span class=Underline>does not retain the
    fee or the equity of redemption in, or a power or right to grant, assign or
    exercise a power of appointment in respect of, any land abutting the land that
    is being conveyed</span> or otherwise dealt with other than land that is the
    whole of one or more lots or blocks within one or more registered plans of
    subdivision … [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the Landlord, since the Cottages were not within a registered plan of
    subdivision and it retained the fee in abutting lands, the leases would
    contravene <em>PA </em>s. 50(3), with the result that under <em>PA</em> s.
    50(21) the leases would “not create or convey any interest in land.” The only
    way to avoid that result, in the Landlord’s submission, would be for the Board
    to hold that the Cottages were not subject to the <em>RTA</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    both the <em>RTA</em> and the <em>PA</em> contain sections which state that
    each Act prevails in the event one of its provisions conflicts with that of
    another statute,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> the Landlord submitted that public policy considerations required the
    subdivision control provisions of the <em>PA</em> to prevail over the deemed
    tenancy renewal provisions of the <em>RTA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board rejected the Landlord’s submission, holding that the deemed renewal of
    residential tenancies right contained in <em>RTA </em>s. 38 did not conflict
    with <em>PA </em>s. 50(3) because the latter section only applied to
    “agreements” of 21 years or more, not “to a statutory provision for security of
    tenure,” such as <em>RTA </em>s. 38(1). The Board also found that even if the
    lease agreements were “void” under <em>PA</em> s. 50(21), the tenancies would
    continue to be subject to the <em>RTA</em>.</p>
  <p class=Heading>REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court dismissed the Landlord’s appeal. The court found it
    unnecessary to determine the applicable standard of review as it held that the
    Board’s decision was correct. At paras. 22-23 of its  reasons, the Divisional
    Court stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, the Board correctly interpreted s. 50(3) and
    correctly observed that the Landlord’s interpretation of the subsection would
    lead to an absurd result. The wording of section 50(3) is directed at the
    parties <span class=Underline>entering into an agreement that has the effect</span> of directly or indirectly providing for the use of the land for more than 21
    years. In other words, for a lease to be void, it is the agreement entered into
    by the parties, not a statutory provision, that must have the effect of
    providing for a term of usage of more than 21 years. …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Such an interpretation is consistent with the legislature’s
    intention to prevent people from circumventing the subdivision control
    provisions of the <em>PA </em>by entering into leases with a term of more than
    21 years and consistent with the remedial purpose of the <em>RTA </em>to
    protect residential tenants in Ontario. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its appeal to this court, the Landlord seeks to set aside the orders of the
    Divisional Court and to dismiss the respondents’ applications to the Board. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board intervened on the issue of the standard of review to be applied to its
    decisions, but took no position on the merits of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=Heading>Effect of the <em>Matthews </em>decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Landlord argues that even though the respondents’ Cottages fall within the
    definition of “rental units” in the <em>RTA</em>, s. 50(3) of the <em>PA</em> renders
    the leases void because of the operation of <em>RTA </em>s. 38(1). Therefore,
    argues the Landlord, the respondents cannot rely on the rent control provisions
    in the <em>RTA</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, that argument is not open to the Landlord in the context of this appeal.
    In <em>Matthews</em>, this court held that the rent control provisions of the <em>RTA </em>applied to the land leases in question in that case. The parties agreed

    the court in <em>Matthews </em>was not directed to the possible conflict

    a five-judge panel be constituted.<em> </em>In fact, the Landlord did not
    expressly take the position that <em>Matthews</em> was wrongly decided (though

    support of its position that this court should consider the <em>PA</em> issue
    and the effect of the application of the <em>RTA </em>to land lease communities
    in Ontario, the Landlord argued in its factum that the <em>RTA’s</em> application
    to the respondents’ Cottages could “have disastrous consequences for the
    orderly development and environment of Ontario.” However, this submission
    ignores the <em>Land Lease Statute Law Amendment Act, 1994</em>,<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[9]</span></span></span></a> which simultaneously amended both the <em>PA</em> and Part IV of the <em>Landlord
    and Tenant Act</em><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]</span></span></span></a> (predecessor to the current <em>RTA</em>) to recognize the category of “land
    lease community home.” At that time, the <em>PA</em> was amended to prohibit the
    future construction of land lease community homes except on parcels of land
    within a registered plan of subdivision or which fall within the exemptions of
    the present <em>PA</em> ss. 50(3)(b) or 50(5)(a) (which apply where a grantor
    does <span class=Underline>not</span> retain the fee in abutting lands). The prohibition
    in that amendment is now found in <em>PA</em> s. 46, which provides: </p>
  <p class=CQuote style='page-break-after:avoid'>46(1) … </p>
  <p class=CQuote>“parcel of land” means a lot or block within a registered plan
    of subdivision or any land that may be legally conveyed under the exemption
    provided in clause 50 (3) (b) or clause 50 (5) (a).</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2.1) Unless otherwise authorized by a by-law in force under
    section 34 or an order of the Minister made under clause 47 (1) (a), or a
    permit issued under section 13 of the Public Lands Act, <span class=Underline>no
    person shall construct or erect or locate or use or cause to be constructed,
    erected, located or used a land lease community home except on a parcel of land
    as defined in subsection (1)</span>, and in no case except as otherwise so
    authorized shall any person construct, erect, locate or use or cause to be
    constructed, erected, located or used more than one land lease community home
    on any such parcel of land. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    there is no concern that future developers could evade the subdivision control
    provisions of the <em>PA</em> by entering into 20-year land leases where the
    parcels of land are not part of a registered plan of subdivision. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Indefinite renewal of pre-1994
    land leases</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    underlying issue in this dispute is whether the rent control provisions of the <em>RTA </em>apply to the respondents’ Cottage leases (which replaced leases that
    pre-existed the 1994 amendments and therefore were not affected by the
    amendments).<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[11]</span></span></span></a> As discussed, that issue was decided in <em>Matthews</em>.<em> </em>The
    question of whether the leases are subject to the indefinite, automatic renewal
    provisions of the <em>RTA </em>– and if so, whether that would create a
    conflict with <em>PA </em>s. 50(3) –<em> </em>should not, and need not, be decided
    in the context of the present appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the 1994 amendments, the <em>Landlord and Tenant Act </em>did not
    provide for a tenant’s right to indefinite renewal or security of tenure; the
    security of tenure that exists today in the <em>RTA</em> was not available to
    tenants until 1997, with the enactment of the <em>Tenant Protection Act, 1997</em>.<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[12]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is therefore arguable whether the legislature, in simultaneously enacting <em>PA </em>s. 46 and adding land lease communities to the <em>Landlord and Tenant Act</em>,
    had the intention to allow indefinite, automatic renewal of existing 20-year
    land leases that were not part of a registered plan of subdivision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the proper context, it may be open to a party to raise the issue of the possible
    conflict between <em>PA</em> s. 50(3) and <em>RTA </em>s. 38(1) as these
    provisions apply to pre-1994 land leases, potentially including the respondents’
    Cottage leases.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in the current appeal, along with the failure to address the conflict with the <em>Matthews</em> decision or seek to have a five-judge panel reconsider that decision, the
    parties did not direct the court to <em>PA </em>s. 46, or provide any guidance
    on how to approach or interpret the 1994 amendments. Nor did they provide this
    court with evidence regarding the number of pre-1994 land lease communities that
    are not subject to a registered plan of subdivision, which evidence might well have
    assisted the court in addressing the policy arguments raised by the Landlord.
    Without evidence and robust argument of these issues, this court is not in a
    position to decide the legal question in the full context of the potential
    effects of the application of <em>RTA </em>s. 38(1) on the Cottage or similar leases.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. On the issue of an application for a
    rent rebate, we are bound by the result in <em>Matthews</em>, and the Landlord
    did not request a review of that decision by a five-judge panel. The Board’s
    decision to grant rent rebates to the Tenants for 2011 and 2012 stands.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agreed that the successful party should be awarded costs of the appeal
    in the amount of $12,000. The Board did not seek any costs. Accordingly, we
    award the Tenants costs fixed at $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and HST.</p>
