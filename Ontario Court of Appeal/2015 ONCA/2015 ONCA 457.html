  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on October 18,
    2013 and the sentence imposed on February 4, 2014 by Justice Anne Mullins of
    the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Heading>van Rensburg J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions for two counts of sexual assault
    and one count of indecent assault. He also appeals his sentence of ten months
    in jail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The incidents leading to the charges occurred between 1979 and 1985 when
    the complainant was between ten and 16 years old. The complainant testified
    that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant, her uncle, at his photography
    studio and at his condominium. The defence was that the assaults did not occur
    at all.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was tried by judge and jury. He contends that the trial
    judge erred in admitting certain evidence, in failing to give limiting
    instructions with respect to the use of that evidence, and in her charge to the
    jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before addressing each argument in turn, I note that this was a case
    that turned on credibility. The Crown’s case rested almost entirely on the
    complainant’s evidence, which was vigorously challenged by defence counsel. The
    defence argued that the complainant’s evidence was implausible and that her
    behaviour during the intervening 30 years was inconsistent with her having been
    sexually abused by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The “Detroit” Trip Evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified about a trip she took to Detroit with the
    appellant and his wife when she was 17 years old. She described two incidents
    of sexual touching that occurred during that trip. The appellant denied that
    the trip took place. He asserts that the trial judge erred in admitting the complainant’s
    account of the Detroit trip, which was evidence of an uncharged incident of
    sexual assault, or in failing to give a limiting instruction in respect of such
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the admissibility of the evidence, the appellant
    contends that, although no objection was taken to the evidence at trial,
    evidence of the incident, which involved a “brazen” assault that occurred while
    the appellant’s wife was present, had little probative value and yet was highly
    prejudicial and ought therefore to have been excluded.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While evidence of prior discreditable conduct is presumptively
    inadmissible, the context and proposed use of the evidence (particularly its
    use by the defence) is important in determining whether the evidence is
    admissible, whether a limiting instruction is required and the content of any
    such instruction: <em>R. v. W.B</em>., [2000] O.J. No. 2184 (C.A.), at paras.
    90-91 and 94-95. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the complainant testified about the Detroit incident
    in chief without objection from the defence. This was not a case where, as the
    appellant’s counsel now suggests, defence counsel simply reacted to the
    evidence once it had been led, and did the best she could with it.  The
    complainant’s account of the Detroit incident was known to the appellant, had
    been explored in the preliminary inquiry, and therefore did not take the
    appellant by surprise. At trial, defence counsel cross-examined the complainant
    in detail about the Detroit incident, and called evidence from the appellant
    and his wife to contradict her account. When the trial judge, during pre-charge
    discussions, asked why the jury had heard this evidence, as it had not been charged
    in the indictment, defence counsel stated that it was admissible as part of the
    narrative.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this court noted in <em>R. v. W.B. </em>at para. 90, defence
    counsel’s position at trial is a key consideration in assessing the probative
    value versus prejudicial effect of the evidence. Defence counsel used the
    complainant’s evidence about the Detroit incident to attempt to undermine her
    credibility, exploiting an inconsistency between her evidence at trial and a
    prior statement about the size of the bed, pointing to the implausibility that
    the complainant would have shared a bed with her aunt and uncle, with her uncle
    in the middle, and challenging her account of the events having occurred when
    her aunt was present. For this incident, a defence witness (the aunt) was able
    to directly contradict the complainant’s account. The defence also questioned
    the complainant’s apparent enthusiasm to travel to Detroit with someone who had
    sexually abused her in the past. According to the defence, the complainant’s
    evidence about the Detroit trip made “no sense”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the evidence of the Detroit trip was clearly admissible
    and there was no error on the part of the trial judge in failing to exclude
    it.  As Doherty J.A. noted in <em>W.B</em>., at para. 91: “The fact that the
    evidence did not have [the intended] effect on this jury cannot condemn the
    [defence] strategy as inappropriate, nor can it open the door in this court to
    an attack on the admissibility of the evidence that ignores the manner in which
    the entire trial was conducted.”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury as to
    the limited use it could make of the evidence about the Detroit incident, and cautioned
    against propensity reasoning. The trial judge gave the specific instruction
    that defence counsel requested: she told the jury that the counts the appellant
    was facing “[have] nothing to do with any events that are alleged to have
    occurred near or in Detroit Michigan”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it may well have been appropriate for the trial judge to have given a limiting
    instruction warning the jury against propensity reasoning, I am not persuaded
    that any reversible error occurred from her failure to do so. It was clear to
    the jury that the appellant was facing three specific charges and that he was
    not charged with respect to the Detroit incident. It was also clear that the case
    turned on credibility and that the defence relied on aspects of the complainant’s
    evidence about the Detroit trip in challenging her overall credibility. A
    further direction to explain the proper and improper uses of propensity
    reasoning in this case may well have distracted the jury from its task and was
    unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss this ground of appeal  </p>
  <p class=Heading>Prior Consistent Statements and Adverse Inference Instruction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his second ground of appeal, the appellant complains of deficiencies in the
    charge regarding the complainant’s evidence that between the ages of eight and
    14 she had mentioned the assaults to a girl named Tammy, to children in the
    playground when she was in grade five, and to her brother John and cousin
    Linda. She also testified that she told her boyfriend (now husband) about the
    abuse when she was 18. The appellant asserts that the trial judge ought to have
    instructed the jury that the evidence of the prior disclosures was admissible
    for two limited purposes: as narrative to provide chronological context and for
    the truth of their contents only to the extent that they tended to rebut the
    defence’s suggestion that the complaint had recently fabricated her
    allegations. The jury ought to have been instructed further that the evidence
    was not admissible to corroborate the complainant’s allegations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    consistent statements are generally inadmissible to buttress a witness’
    testimony.  However, in this case, the evidence of the complainant’s
    disclosures was admitted, with the agreement of the defence, as part of the
    narrative, and to rebut an allegation of recent fabrication. In her charge, the
    trial judge cautioned the jury about the hearsay dangers of what the others
    said to the complainant in response to her disclosures. She did not however provide
    any further instruction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it is generally appropriate for a trial judge to give an instruction about the
    proper and prohibited uses of a prior consistent statement, and while such an
    instruction may well have been advisable, the failure to do so was not a
    reversible error in this case. In <em>R. v. Demetrius</em>, [2003] O.J. No.
    3729 (C.A.), at paras. 21-22, Sharpe J.A. observed: “Although limiting
    instructions are generally required in cases involving prior consistent
    statements, there are circumstances where a limiting instruction may not be
    required. The adequacy of a trial judge’s instructions must be assessed in the
    context of the particular case on a functional basis”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, there was no real danger that the substance of the prior statements
    would be used for the proof of their contents to corroborate the complainant’s
    account, when the statements, as related at trial, contained no details. The complainant
    simply testified that she had told others the appellant was touching her, and
    with respect to her brother and Tammy, what they had said in response. The
    defence relied on the complainant’s evidence about the prior disclosures to
    undermine her credibility. Among other things, the defence suggested that it
    was implausible that the abuse would continue after the complainant had told
    others about it, and that the complainant’s husband would have maintained a
    cordial relationship with the appellant if she had told him about the abuse. In
    her charge, the trial judge referred to the complainant’s evidence of her
    disclosures, and repeated the defence position that, while the complainant
    claimed to have told others about the alleged abuse at the time, no one had
    corroborated her claims of disclosure, and the defence witness Tammy had denied
    any such disclosure. In these circumstances, the instructions were adequate.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
    jury that it was open to them to draw an adverse inference against the Crown
    for failing to call any of the recipients of the disclosure as witnesses. This
    instruction was requested at trial and refused by the trial judge, after she
    heard argument from counsel and considered the relevant case law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not interfere with the trial judge’s decision not to give an adverse
    inference instruction in this case. None of the potential witnesses could have corroborated
    the sexual assaults themselves; at most they would have bolstered the
    complainant’s prior consistent statements, which would have been an improper
    use of the statements. The trial judge properly focussed on the permitted and
    prohibited use of the evidence, which was introduced in response to the defence
    of recent fabrication. It is apparent from the transcript that the trial judge
    was concerned about the potential confusion for the jury if they were
    instructed about the need for corroboration and their possible distraction from
    the central issues at trial. In any event, the point that no one had
    corroborated the complainant’s evidence of disclosure and that this was
    contradicted by Tammy, was put squarely to the jury in the trial judge’s charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that there was no error in the treatment of the
    complainant’s prior disclosures in the trial judge’s charge to the jury.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Appellant’s Alleged Admission</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third ground of appeal is that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on
    how to consider an alleged admission by the appellant. The complainant
    testified about a phone call she had received from the appellant just after she
    called her aunt and uncle to thank them for a gift for her 40th birthday. According
    to the complainant, the appellant asked whether she remembered when they used
    to “fool around”, and that he said that he had done a lot of bad things, but
    that that was the worst. In his testimony at trial, the appellant acknowledged
    a call at the time of the complainant’s birthday, but denied that he had made
    the inculpatory statements.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury that they
    could not use this evidence of an admission by the appellant for its truth, unless
    they were satisfied that he had in fact made the statement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in the trial judge’s instructions in relation to the alleged
    admission. The charge contained a <em>W. (D.) </em>instruction, instructed the
    jurors that they could believe some, all or none of the evidence of a witness,
    and fully canvassed the question of reasonable doubt. It would have been obvious
    to the jury that they could not consider the alleged admission by the
    appellant, unless they were satisfied that he had made the statement recounted
    by the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Unduly Complicated Charge </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fourth ground of appeal is that the jury charge was overly complicated because
    the trial judge instructed with respect to consent when this was not an issue
    at trial. This argument is without merit. The trial judge emphasized repeatedly
    that the “real issue” in the case was whether the events ever took place. The
    brief references to consent when the trial judge was reviewing the essential
    elements of the offences were not objected to by defence counsel, and in the
    circumstances would not have distracted the jury from their task.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>Unreasonable Verdict on Count One</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally
    on the conviction appeal, the appellant argues that the verdict on count one
    was unreasonable because the Crown failed to prove the date of the offence,
    which was a necessary element.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count
    one involved an assault that occurred in the appellant’s condominium, when the
    complainant said she was there to watch on TV and tape a Live Aid concert. The indictment
    referred to the offence occurring “on or about July 13, 1985”.  Under
    cross-examination the complainant was uncertain as to the specific date. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asserts that because the Crown failed to prove a specific element of the offence &ndash; its date &ndash; the conviction cannot stand. This argument was not raised at trial. In this case, the specific date was not an essential element of the offence. The offence was anchored to a specific event, not a specific date. The appellant was not misled or prejudiced in his defence by the date on the indictment; indeed his defence was that it could not have happened as he was occupied photographing weddings every Saturday in the summer, and therefore would not have been at the condominium as alleged by the complainant. I would therefore reject this ground of appeal.   </p>
  <p class=Heading>Sentence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence of ten months in prison, asserting
    that the sentence was harsh and excessive and that the trial judge did not give
    proper consideration to the option of a conditional sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the decision to impose a custodial sentence of ten months and to refuse a conditional sentence was reasonable in the circumstances and adequately explained. The sentence was fit and there was no error in principle.  The trial judge correctly recognized that the key sentencing factors in respect of sexual assault are denunciation and deterrence. Although she recognized that such objectives may be achieved through a conditional sentence, she rejected that option. The custodial sentence of ten months properly reflected the mitigating circumstances of the appellant's age, health problems and the passage of time since the offences, as well as the aggravating circumstances of an offence committed by a person in a position of trust against a vulnerable child on repeated occasions. In my view, the trial judge did not, as asserted by the appellant, give undue emphasis to the appellant's lack of remorse but properly considered this as one of a variety of factors in determining whether a conditional sentence was appropriate. </p>
  <p class=Heading>DISPOSITION </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore dismiss the appeal, grant leave to appeal sentence and dismiss
    the sentence appeal. </p>
