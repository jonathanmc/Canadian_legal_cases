  <h1><span class=Underline><span style='text-transform:none;text-decoration:

text-decoration:none'>Overview</span></span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Giuseppe Graziano was a teacher in a Hamilton high school.
    After an eight-day trial before Carpenter-Gunn J., he was convicted of sexual
    interference with and sexual assault of J.M., a 14-year-old male student in
    Grade 9. He was sentenced to six months in jail. Initially he appealed both his
    convictions and his sentence, but he has now abandoned his sentence appeal and
    appeals only his convictions. The principal issue on the appeal is whether the
    trial judge erred by permitting the Crown to recall one of its witnesses in
    reply.</p>
  <h5><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></span><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>What this case is about</span></span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two incidents in early 2011 gave rise to these proceedings, though the
    charges against the appellant arose out of the second incident. Credibility was
    the central issue at trial. The trial judge had to decide whether the
    appellant’s denial raised a reasonable doubt, and even if it did not, whether
    on all the evidence she did accept she was convinced of the appellant’s guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first incident occurred on January 26, at the end of a French exam J.M.
    was writing. The appellant was not J.M.’s teacher, but he was monitoring the
    exam. During the exam, the appellant had assisted J.M. with some of his
    answers, even, according to J.M., writing out several answers in J.M.’s exam
    booklet.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.M. testified that as he was leaving the exam room, after handing in his
    booklet, the appellant said to him “you know you owe me, right?”, made a
    gesture suggesting a “hand job”, and then said “something like a blow job”. In
    his testimony the appellant admitted saying “you owe me”, but denied making a
    hand gesture or saying anything suggestive of a blow job.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second incident occurred two weeks later, on February 9. J.M. had
    been suspended from school for three days for his role in encouraging a fight between
    some other students. Just after the suspension had been imposed, the appellant
    saw J.M. in the hallway. The appellant testified that J.M. seemed angry, and that
    he asked to come inside the appellant’s classroom so he could vent about the
    suspension. J.M. testified that the appellant asked him to come in and discuss
    the French exam. Both agreed that the room was darkened or dimly lit, and that the
    appellant and J.M. were alone in it for about 30 minutes. J.M. testified that
    while he was there, the appellant asked him how big his penis was and whether
    he had ever done anything with another guy. He told J.M. not to tell anyone
    what he had said. As J.M. was leaving, the appellant asked to see his penis, to
    which J.M. said no. The appellant then touched J.M.’s penis over his clothes.
    The appellant denied that he had asked about or touched J.M.’s penis.</p>
  <h5><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></span><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge’s reasons
    for conviction</span></span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons are lengthy. She set out in detail the
    evidence of each witness. And she gave several reasons why she was convinced
    beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pivotal to the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence were J.M.’s
    reactions and demeanour after the February 9 incident in the classroom. By all
    accounts, even that of the appellant, J.M. was angry and emotional on the
    afternoon of February 9. The defence’s theory was that J.M. was angry because
    he had been suspended from school and would not be permitted to play in an
    important basketball game. The Crown’s theory was that J.M was angry and
    emotional, even tearful, according to some witnesses, because he had been
    sexually assaulted. In accepting the Crown’s theory, the trial judge relied on
    video surveillance evidence and on the evidence of two of his classmates and
    that of an educational assistant, the first adult to whom J.M. disclosed what
    the appellant had done. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The school had a video surveillance system, which, though not used in
    the classrooms, intermittently scanned the school’s hallways. The video
    captured some of J.M.’s movements on February 9 after he left the classroom,
    including when he approached the appellant to speak to him about 30 minutes
    later. It also showed a conversation between J.M. and Vice-Principal Tim Hogan,
    who had suspended him. The trial judge found that the video corroborated J.M.’s
    evidence, as it showed that his anger was directed not towards the
    vice-principal, but towards the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two of J.M.’s classmates, who saw J.M. on February 9 after he left the
    classroom, and the educational assistant, who saw him both before and after the
    classroom incident, all testified about J.M.’s changed demeanour. In the light
    of this evidence and the video surveillance, the trial judge found that J.M.’s
    change in demeanour was attributable to the sexual abuse, not to his
    suspension.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also gave two other important reasons for rejecting the appellant’s
    evidence. The first was the appellant’s response when he was called to a
    meeting at the principal’s office on February 10, the day after the classroom
    incident. The appellant was told that an allegation had been made against him
    and that he was being suspended from teaching. He was not told the nature of
    the allegation, who had made it, or even whether the complainant was a male or
    a female student. Yet when told of the suspension, the appellant immediately
    asked, “Is this about [J.M.]?”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other reason the trial judge gave for rejecting the appellant’s evidence arose
    out of the appellant’s brief encounter with Vice-Principal Hogan on February 9,
    shortly after the classroom incident. As I will discuss, the evidence of the
    appellant and Hogan about what was said at that meeting differed significantly.
    The trial judge accepted the evidence of Hogan, whom she found to be a
    thoughtful and credible witness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then summarized her reasons for convicting the appellant:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[M]y decision is primarily based on the independent video
    evidence, the post-event demeanour evidence, and the fact that there was no
    motive for [J.M.], the complainant, to lie about the evidence against the
    accused, combined with the events of the meeting of February 10, 2011, and also
    combined with the corroborating evidence of the other witnesses that I have
    articulated. </p>
  <h5><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></span><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>The grounds of appeal</span></span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his factum, the appellant raised numerous grounds of appeal. In oral argument,
    however, the appellant’s counsel narrowed his appeal to three submissions. His
    first and main submission was that the trial judge erred by permitting the
    Crown to call Vice-Principal Hogan in reply. More specifically, the appellant
    argued that the trial judge erroneously concluded Hogan’s reply evidence was
    permissible under the rule in <em>Browne v. Dunn </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(1893)</span></em>, 6 R. 67 (H.L. (Eng.)), yet gave
    no reasons for her conclusion.</p>

  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>How the issue arose</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown called as one of its witnesses, Vice-Principal Tim Hogan. In his evidence,
    Hogan acknowledged that on the afternoon of February 9 he met briefly with the
    appellant in the hallway. In cross-examination he was asked:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      All right. So, you’re there for a very brief period of  time?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      Yes.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      Exchanged pleasantries with Mr. Graziano?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      I don’t recall, but I could have.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      Okay. It would be the normal thing to do, at least    acknowledge
    that he’s there; right?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      Yes, sure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hogan
    was not questioned further about his brief encounter with the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified. During his examination-in-chief, he said that when he
    spoke with J.M. in the classroom, J.M. was extremely upset about his suspension
    and was angry at Vice-Principal Hogan. The appellant said J.M. swore and called
    Hogan a “fucking asshole”. Shortly after J.M. left the classroom, the appellant
    encountered Hogan in the hallway.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claimed that during their encounter, Hogan commented to him, “that
    kid [J.M.] is strange”. Defence counsel then said to his client, “I think I
    have to stop you there, because I don’t want to hear that”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel, however, objected that the comment the appellant attributed to Hogan
    had never been put to Hogan when he testified. Defence counsel then suggested
    that Crown counsel could ask the appellant about his encounter with Hogan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Crown counsel put to the appellant that he had said nothing
    to Hogan about J.M.’s anger or that J.M. (according to the appellant) was
    “vitriolic” toward Hogan and had called him a “fucking asshole”. The appellant
    responded, “oh, yes, I did”. The Crown again complained that the appellant’s
    evidence had not been put to Hogan when he testified. Eventually the trial
    judge intervened and observed that a potential remedy was available: the Crown
    could recall Hogan. Defence counsel said nothing and the Crown continued his
    cross-examination about what the appellant had said to Hogan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then testified that he had a more detailed conversation with Hogan
    than a mere exchange of pleasantries, as Hogan had testified to in his
    evidence. The appellant repeated that Hogan had said “that kid is weird”. The cross-examination
    continued:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      Okay, sir. But, did you go so far as to say, “This was
    something I’ve never seen before, Mr. Hogan. This kid was out of control. He
    was calling you every name in the book. And, I’m telling you, he’s one angry
    kid. In fact, he left here saying the first person he sees, he’s going to punch
    out”?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      Correct.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      Did you tell him all that?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      Well, I did say, “He has been calling you effin’
    asshole up and down and he was very angry.” He says, “I don’t care. That’s my
    job.”</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      But, I’m curious. Why couldn’t Mr. Hogan have been
    asked that? I guess maybe you don’t know the answer to that. But, is this
    something you told Mr. Markle?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      Yes.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      I see. And, you have related to Mr. Hogan the concerns
    you had for his safety, the extent of the tirade by young [J.M.] in the room. And,
    did you explain to him that you had, in fact, harboured [J.M.] for the 35 or 40
    minutes?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      Well, it wasn’t 35, no, 40. It was less than that. But,
    yes, I did tell him.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      I see. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      I had nothing to hide. I explained to Mr. Hogan
    everything that had gone on. We had a brief discussion, the two of us. And,
    that was that.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next morning, counsel discussed how to deal with the appellant’s testimony
    about his conversation with Hogan, which Hogan had not been asked about. The
    Crown and the trial judge thought that the rule in <em>Browne v. Dunn</em> came
    into play. The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>And, I made the suggestion yesterday that one way of dealing
    with it is to re-call Mr. Hogan. And, we’ve got to be sensitive and alive to <em>Browne
    v. Dunn</em> on the one hand, and we don’t know – we can’t split the case on
    the other hand, but it is an important area.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    then a few minutes later, the trial judge added:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>But, now this issue is out there, and we have already had this
    other witness in the box. So, I think it is a <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> situation.
    So, I tend to agree with the Crown that it is that type of situation. So, the
    question is, what do we do about it, at this point?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown announced that he intended to call Hogan in reply. And, just before court
    adjourned for the day, the Crown reiterated that he intended to re-call Hogan. Defence
    counsel did not then raise any objection to re-calling Hogan.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hogan
    testified in reply. He denied having the conversation with the appellant to
    which the appellant testified. He did not refer to J.M. as strange, and the
    appellant never told him J.M. had called him “a fucking asshole”. Hogan said
    that had J.M. done so, he would likely have increased the length of his
    suspension.</p>

    that statements attributed to J.M. were not put to him during
    cross-examination. The Crown said it did not wish to recall J.M., but asked
    that the trial judge apply the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> and give little or

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found Hogan to be a credible witness and relied heavily on his
    evidence to disbelieve the appellant’s testimony about the incident in the classroom
    with J.M. Indeed, the trial judge referred to Hogan’s evidence and why she
    accepted it over the appellant’s evidence in three separate passages in her
    reasons. First she said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Where there is a conflict between the evidence of the accused
    and Mr. Hogan, the Vice Principal, I accept the evidence of Mr. Hogan. Mr.
    Hogan is an independent witness to the matters in issue. I find he was a
    thoughtful, credible witness. I was impressed by his demeanour.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Hogan denied many statements that the accused said were
    part of the conversation between the accused and Mr. Hogan. For example, that
    the accused told Mr. Hogan that [J.M.] had called him, “A fucking asshole.” I
    accept Mr. Hogan’s evidence that had this information been given to Mr. Hogan,
    he would have increased [J.M.’s] suspension and he would have been shocked.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I found Mr. Hogan’s evidence to be credible. I found Mr.
    Hogan’s evidence discredits the accused’s evidence as to what he said he had
    told Mr. Hogan.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This finding leads me to the conclusion that the accused’s
    testimony about what took place in the classroom on February 9, 2011, should
    not be accepted. Rather I accept [J.M.’s] testimony as to what took place in
    the classroom on February 9, 2011.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    finally:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I also note that the reply evidence of Mr. Hogan was
    unchallenged by the defendant. Given this, I find an inference can be made that
    Mr. Graziano lied about what he says was the substance of the conversation
    between he and Mr. Hogan.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I find if Mr. Graziano had said things to Mr. Hogan on February
    9<sup>th</sup> that he says were discussed that the meeting of February 10 in
    the school office would have been quite different than it in fact was.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hogan’s
    evidence, including his reply evidence, was central to the trial judge’s
    credibility findings. If she erred in permitting the Crown to call Hogan in
    reply, then the appellant would be entitled to a new trial.</p>
  <h6 style='text-align:justify'>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Discussion</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge viewed the issue as one calling for consideration of the rule in <em>Browne
    v. Dunn</em>. The appellant submits that if that was her view, she erred by
    failing to give any reasons for concluding that the rule allowed the Crown to
    call Hogan in reply. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not think that the rule in <em>Browne v. Dunn</em> applies to the situation
    that arose on the appellant’s cross-examination. This court summarized the rule
    in <em>R. v. Henderson</em> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 628 (C.A.), at p. 636:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This well-known rule stands for the proposition that if counsel
    is going to challenge the credibility of a witness by calling contradictory
    evidence, the witness must be given the chance to address the contradictory
    evidence in cross-examination while he or she is in the witness-box.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    however, defence counsel did not call contradictory evidence from his client.
    Quite the contrary. He did not wish to lead evidence from his client about any
    conversation between the appellant and Hogan. Had he done so, without first
    putting the contradictory evidence to Hogan on cross-examination, then
    depending on the significance of the evidence, the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> might well have been breached.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    the evidence the Crown wanted to address by calling Hogan in reply came from
    the appellant almost entirely during his cross-examination. Thus, to the extent
    the trial judge relied on the rule in <em>Browne v. Dunn</em> to permit the
    Crown to call Hogan in reply, she erred. The proper approach would have been to
    consider whether permitting the Crown to call Hogan in reply offended the rule
    that prohibits the Crown from splitting its case. In <em>Krause v. The Queen</em> (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), at pp. 390-91, McIntyre J. set out the
    rule against case-splitting and its rationale:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The general rule is that the Crown, or in civil matters the
    plaintiff, will not be allowed to split its case. The Crown or the plaintiff
    must produce and enter in its own case all the clearly relevant evidence it
    has, or that it intends to rely upon, to establish its case with respect to all
    the issues raised in the pleadings; in a criminal case, the indictment and any
    particulars… The underlying reason for this rule is that the defendant or the
    accused is entitled at the close of the Crown’s case to have before it the full
    case for the Crown so that it is known from the outset what must be met in
    response. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, however, the Crown’s calling Hogan in reply did not breach this
    rule. In <em>Krause</em>, at p. 391, McIntyre J. discussed the exception to the
    rule against case-splitting – that is, when the Crown may be entitled to call
    reply evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The plaintiff or the Crown may be allowed to call evidence in rebuttal
    after completion of the defence case, where the defence has raised some new
    matter or defence which the Crown has had no opportunity to deal with and which
    the Crown or the plaintiff could not reasonably have anticipated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me the exception referred to in <em>Krause</em> applies here. In his
    examination-in-chief, the appellant had testified about J.M.’s angry and
    vitriolic comments about Hogan. He had also testified, albeit briefly, that he
    and Hogan discussed J.M. It was reasonable for the Crown to test the
    appellant’s evidence, as he did, by suggesting that if J.M. had said the things
    the appellant claimed, the appellant would have reported the exchange to Hogan.
    The appellant claimed he did tell Hogan, and recounted their conversation. And,
    even though defence counsel intentionally chose not to question his client
    about his conversation with Hogan, it was the appellant who brought up the conversation
    during his examination-in-chief, and expanded on it under cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown could not reasonably have anticipated the appellant’s evidence about his
    conversation with Hogan, and thus had no opportunity to deal with it during
    Hogan’s examination-in-chief. And it was important evidence because unless it
    was contradicted, it seemed to support the defence’s theory that J.M. was angry
    and emotional because of his suspension from school, and not because he had
    been sexually assaulted. Thus, I think it was within the trial judge’s
    discretion to permit the Crown to call Hogan in reply. Moreover, defence
    counsel at trial made at most a lukewarm objection to this reply evidence being
    called. Accordingly, I would not give effect to the appellant’s main ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Linespacingsingle style='text-align:justify'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Did the trial judge improperly
    rely on the evidence of three parties who were not called as witnesses?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her lengthy reasons, the trial judge referred to an email from a woman named
    Nancy Brown, who apparently commuted daily to the school with the appellant.
    The appellant had been ordered by the school board not to talk to anyone about
    the incident with J.M. The contents of Ms. Brown’s email suggested he had
    breached this order, and the trial judge so found. Nancy Brown, however, was
    not called as a witness at trial. Her email was thus inadmissible hearsay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown on appeal acknowledges that the trial judge should not have used the
    contents of the email to comment adversely on the appellant. However, the Crown
    submits the trial judge’s error in doing so was harmless. I agree. In rejecting
    the appellant’s evidence the trial judge did not rely on the email.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in her lengthy narrative of the evidence, the trial judge referred to
    statements given by two other students. Although neither student was called as
    a witness, and thus their statements were inadmissible hearsay, the trial judge
    did not rely in any way on either student’s statement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Linespacingsingle style='text-align:justify'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Did the trial judge err by failing
    to resolve inconsistencies in the evidence of J.M.?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that there were inconsistencies in J.M.’s evidence, that they
    undermined the reliability and credibility of his testimony, and that the trial
    judge erred by failing to resolve these inconsistencies. I do not agree with
    the appellant’s submission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge expressly addressed inconsistencies in J.M.’s evidence. But she
    found that on the two critical questions – what happened on January 26 during
    the French exam and what happened on February 9 in the classroom – “the thrust
    of [J.M.’s] evidence remained the same.” She did not err in that finding. Thus,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Linespacingsingle style='text-align:justify'>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Other issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raised several other issues in his notice of appeal and
    his factum, which he did not press in oral submissions. These included that the
    trial judge erred in her application of <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
    742; that she erred in not ruling on whether the Crown had improperly asked the
    appellant to waive solicitor-client privilege; and that she erred in admitting
    similar fact evidence. As I have said, the appellant did not pursue these
    issues and I see no merit to them. I would dismiss these grounds of appeal.</p>
