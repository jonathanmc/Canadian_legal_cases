  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Theresa Maddalena of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated December 30, 2014.</p>
  <p><b>By the Court:</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> On August 2, 2013, the motion judge, among other things, granted default
    judgment against the appellant, Dwayne F. Romaniuk, in favour of the
    respondents, Raymond I. and Magdalene Ravazzolo, for $101,347.87, together with
    prejudgment interest from September 1, 2012 to the date of judgment, and
    post-judgment interest thereafter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals the same motion judge’s December 30, 2014 order dismissing
    his motion to set aside the default judgment. He argues that the motion judge
    erred by refusing to set aside the default judgment. In support of his
    argument, he seeks to introduce fresh evidence. We agree that the motion judge
    erred in dismissing the appellant’s motion to set aside the default judgment. We
    come to this conclusion without reference to the fresh evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we set aside the default judgment and
    substitute default judgment against the appellant for $13,877.36, plus
    prejudgment interest from September 1, 2012 to August 2, 2013, and
    post-judgment interest thereafter.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Briefly, the relevant facts are as follows.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2001, the appellant, an investment and wealth management advisor, wanted
    to buy a co-worker's book of clients. He needed a loan to complete the
    transaction. His wife, together with her parents, the respondents, co-signed the
    appellant’s loan agreement. His wife and the respondents pledged jointly-owned investments
    as security for the loan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2007, the appellant moved the loan to Bank of Montreal (&quot;BMO&quot;)
    to obtain more favourable interest rates. The appellant's wife and the
    respondents co-signed new loan documents. They pledged more investments as
    security for the loan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and his wife separated in April 2009.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 28, 2012, BMO demanded from the respondents an overdue amount of
    $2,775.52. On September 19, 2012, the respondents received a notice of
    repossession and intent to sell the pledged securities. The respondents paid
    BMO loan installments totaling $13,877.36 to protect their securities. BMO did
    not sell the securities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents sued the appellant. They alleged that the appellant was
    their personal investment and wealth management advisor, and thereby knew of
    their modest holdings and limited understanding of financial and investment
    matters. They said he did not explain the risk in the loan transaction. They
    alleged that, in agreeing to transfer the loan to BMO, they did not know they
    were pledging additional securities. They also said the appellant negligently
    and/or fraudulently represented to them that BMO would release them from
    liability and release the pledged securities in 2011. They also asserted that the
    appellant breached his fiduciary duty to them, breached contractual
    obligations, and breached a duty to act in good faith. They claimed damages in
    the amount of $75,000, plus punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents' Statement of Claim was served on the appellant on March 25, 2013.
    He served a Notice of Intent to Defend on April 5, 2013 but was noted in
    default on May 14, 2013 after failing to serve a Statement of Defence. Despite a
    letter from the respondents' lawyer advising that the respondents would move
    for default judgment if the appellant did not serve and file a Statement of
    Defence by June 20, 2013, the appellant did not file a Statement of Defence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents brought an <em>ex parte</em> motion for default judgment. In
    support of their motion, Raymond Ravazzolo filed an affidavit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 2, 2013, the motion judge granted default judgment in favour of the
    respondents for the $101,347.87 they sought, together with prejudgment interest
    from September 1, 2012 to the date of judgment, and post-judgment interest
    thereafter. In his affidavit in support of the motion for default judgment, Mr.
    Ravazzolo broke down the $101,347.87 amount as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Payments made by the respondents              $13,877.36</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Monies claimed by BMO                               $46,317.64</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Punitive damages                                         $30,000.00</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Costs to date                                                $11,152.87</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    order granting default judgment also declared that the appellant was in “breach
    of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of his duty to act in good faith,
    fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation”. The motion judge also ordered that the
    judgment shall survive any order of discharge from bankruptcy pursuant to ss. 178(1)(d)
    and (e) of the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3. The
    motion judge did not provide reasons for granting judgment against the
    appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 7, 2013, BMO obtained a default judgment against the appellant for $47,043.44
    – the balance owing on the loan – <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:
none'>with interest from the date of the judgment</span></span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant became aware of the respondents' default judgment in January 2014 and
    brought his motion in April 2014, after the respondents refused to consent to
    setting aside the judgment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledges his obligation to repay the respondents the $13,877.36
    they paid to BMO and consents to judgment against him in that amount. He also
    acknowledges his obligation to pay BMO the remaining debt of $47,043.44.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The test for setting aside a default judgment</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Mountain View Farms Ltd. v. McQueen</em>, 2014 ONCA 194, 119 O.R. (3d) 561,
    at paras. 48-49, this court set out five factors that a court should consider
    in determining whether to set aside a default judgment:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the motion was brought promptly after the defendant learned of
    the default judgment;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether there is a plausible excuse or explanation for the defendant's
    default in complying with the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the facts establish that the defendant has an arguable defence
    on the merits;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The potential prejudice to the moving party should the motion be
    dismissed and the potential prejudice to the respondent should the motion be
    allowed; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of any order the court might make on the overall integrity of
    the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    stated in <em>Mountain View</em>, at paras. 50 and 51: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>These factors are not to be treated as rigid rules; the court
    must consider the particular circumstances of each case to decide whether it is
    just to relieve the defendant from the consequences of his or her default.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For instance, the presence of an arguable defence on the merits
    may justify the court exercising its discretion to set aside the default
    judgment, even if the other factors are unsatisfied in whole or in part. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The motion judge’s reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that the appellant failed to meet the test in <em>Mountain
    View</em>. She wrote, at paras. 55 and 59:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I find the delay of Romaniuk unexplained, inexplicable,
    inexcusable, and unjustified. Romaniuk's defence has no &quot;air of
    reality&quot;. In spite of being aware as early as May 15, 2013 that his
    Statement of Defence was due, and in spite of having an offer that the
    Statement of Defence must be filed by June 20, 2013 and paying $500 plus HST,
    he deliberately chose to do nothing. This was a deliberate, calculated and
    conscious act. He acted only when he realized that a garnishment of his wages
    was to occur. Except for this action he would have continued to do nothing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>                   …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The setting aside of the judgment would be at great prejudice
    to the plaintiffs who are elderly and whose securities are still pledged with
    BMO, and remain indebted to BMO as a result of Romaniuk.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge made several errors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    failed to consider the first <em>Mountain View</em> factor, namely whether the
    appellant had moved promptly to set the default judgment aside. Once he learned
    of the default judgment, the appellant moved reasonably promptly to set it aside.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    importantly, the motion judge erred in concluding that the appellant did not
    have an arguable defence on the merits. The respondents did not advance a
    simple, liquidated claim. The motion judge failed to consider whether the
    Statement of Claim and the evidence led by the respondents on their motion for
    default judgment entitled them to the damages awarded</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant clearly has a defence to the extent the motion judge ordered the
    appellant to pay the respondents amounts that the respondents have not paid to
    BMO. The appellant does not contest the BMO judgment against him. The
    respondents have a judgment for damages that they have not suffered and may
    never suffer.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    the respondents did not claim the declaratory relief or an order that the
    judgment shall survive any order of discharge from bankruptcy, that the motion
    judge granted. Moreover, the motion judge, on the motion for default judgment, failed
    to analyze whether the facts alleged in the Statement of Claim entitled the
    respondents to the declaratory relief or to the punitive damages they sought.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the motion judge failed to consider the prejudice to the appellant of refusing
    to set aside the default judgment and misapprehended the prejudice to the
    respondents of setting aside the default judgment. The substantial prejudice to
    the appellant, an investment and wealth management advisor, of declarations
    that he has committed breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and fraudulent
    misrepresentation is obvious. The default judgment does not provide any
    assurance to the respondents that BMO will not proceed against them or will release
    their securities. Setting aside the default judgment would not have seriously
    prejudiced the respondents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, in these circumstances, it is just to relieve the appellant from the majority
    of the consequences of his default. We come to this conclusion without considering
    the appellant's additional argument that the respondents failed to fully disclose
    all material facts on their <em>ex parte</em> motion for default judgment.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore allowed.  The August 2, 2013 order granting default
    judgment against the appellant is set aside. In its stead, judgment is granted against
    the appellant for the amount of $13,877.36, plus prejudgment interest = from
    September 1, 2012 to August 2, 2013, and post-judgment interest thereafter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal in the amount of $10,000, inclusive
