  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following a 19-year marriage, Carol Holman and
    Bruce Holman divorced. They had two children of the marriage, both now adults. After
    the marriage ended, Mr. Holman paid child and spousal support and, when the
    time came, contributed to the girls’ post-secondary education. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2012, Mr. Holman brought a motion to change his
    support obligations, seeking a termination of child and spousal support. In
    response, Ms. Holman sought an increase in child and spousal support based on
    increases to Mr. Holman’s income since the most recent order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge terminated child support and
    found that Mr. Holman had overpaid child support. He terminated spousal support
    as of November 15, 2013 but found that Mr. Holman had underpaid spousal
    support. He calculated that the net amount owed by Ms. Holman to Mr. Holman was
    $40,287.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Holman appeals. She argues the motion judge
    made a number of calculation errors with respect to child support, should have
    increased spousal support after terminating child support, and erred in
    terminating spousal support. I agree that the motion judge erred in his child
    support calculations. I also agree that for the period post-child-support that
    he ordered spousal support, the motion judge should have increased that support
    based on the <em>without child</em> formula in the Spousal Support Advisory
    Guidelines (the “SSAGs”) that now applied.  On my calculations, Ms. Holman should
    pay Mr. Holman $36,646 on account of child support which Mr. Holman overpaid. 
    Mr. Holman should pay Ms. Holman $11,204 on account of spousal support which he
    underpaid.  However, while I agree that the motion judge would ideally have
    explained his decision to terminate spousal support in the context of the
    durational range set out in the SSAGs, I do not find that he committed a
    reversible error in terminating spousal support.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Holmans married in 1983 and separated in
    2002. They have twin girls, K. and P., who are now adults. Both Mr. and Ms.
    Holman are now over sixty years old. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the parties married, Ms. Holman gave up
    her job so that the couple could move to Halifax where Mr. Holman accepted a
    higher paying job. During their two years in Nova Scotia, Ms. Holman cashed in
    her pension and maintained the couple’s home.  Mr. Holman was promoted once
    again when they returned to Ontario, but Ms. Holman did not regain her job. She
    worked in a local hospital until she gave birth to the twins. She stayed home
    to care for the twins from 1989 to 1998-1999, when she returned to work.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The couple separated in 2002. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2003, Mr. Holman obtained a real estate
    licence, and his income dropped from a six-figure salary to approximately $14,000.
    Between 2004 and 2012, Mr. Holman’s income increased from $45,594 to $129,000.  In
    2011, Mr. Holman purchased a home jointly with his new spouse for $385,000,
    with a mortgage of about $337,247 and a $19,000 loan from one of his siblings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Holman started a full-time position in 2003
    with a company partly owned by her brother. Her income increased from $21,000
    in 2003 to $50,360 in 2012.  In 2010, she inherited approximately $300,000 from
    her mother, which she used to purchase her mother’s home.  She spent
    approximately $135,000 to renovate the home, which was mostly financed on her
    line of credit.  She also has approximately $100,000 in savings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both K. and P. have resided with their mother
    since the separation. Neither one pays room nor board. Both young women graduated
    from university in May 2011. P. earned $23,135 in 2012.  In 2013, K. completed
    a two-year veterinary technician diploma. She currently earns $25,000 per year.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties divorced in 2004 and, at that time,
    consented to orders for spousal and child support that were based on Mr. Holman
    having an imputed income of $98,612. Mr. Holman was to pay two-thirds of the
    children’s s. 7 expenses under the <em>Federal Child Support Guidelines</em>,
    S.O.R./97-175 (the “CSGs”), which was less than his income would have required.
    The terms of the 2004 support orders were varied on consent by orders made in
    March 2009 and February 2010 (“the 2009 and 2010 orders”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although premised on Mr. Holman's income at the
    time, the 2009 and 2010 orders were a departure from s. 7 of the CSGs in that
    they limited Mr. Holman’s contribution to the children’s post-secondary
    education to $5,000 per year per child. These orders also relieved Mr. Holman
    of the obligation to pay child support for K. for six months of the year (assuming
    she would be away at school during that period). The orders required that the
    parties exchange financial information by May 15 of each year and contained a
    mechanism for adjusting both child and spousal support based on fluctuations in
    income. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2012, Mr. Holman brought a motion seeking an
    order terminating child support as of the date each child had completed her
    first degree, and seeking an order terminating spousal support as of May 1,
    2011. In response, Ms. Holman sought an increase in the spousal support payable
    and outstanding additional child support based on increases in Mr. Holman’s
    income.</span></p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decision Below</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 22, 2013, the motion judge changed the
    prior orders by terminating the child support payable by Mr. Holman effective
    as of the date each child had completed her education and attained a level of
    self-sufficiency (end of December 2011 for P. and May 1, 2013 for K.). He
    rejected Mr. Holman’s position that his child support obligations ceased as
    soon as the children completed their first post-secondary degree. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge then calculated the amount by
    which Mr. Holman had overpaid child support. He did not take into account the
    increased child support owing under the existing orders due to Mr. Holman’s increased
    income. He found that K. was able to contribute $12,000 to her education and
    living expenses in 2011 and 2012, and deducted that amount from the amount of
    child support owing by Mr. Holman. When dealing with the period in which child
    support had terminated for P. but remained owing for K., the motion judge
    divided in half the amount Mr. Holman had paid for two children to determine
    what he owed for one child. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to spousal support, the motion judge
    found that because Ms. Holman was disadvantaged economically on account of her
    marriage and Mr. Holman had the means to pay, spousal support should not be
    terminated as of May of 2011. However, he also found that Ms. Holman had become
    financially self-sufficient. He terminated spousal support as of November 15,
    2013. He adjusted the quantum of spousal support that had been payable up to
    November 15, 2013 based on increases in Mr. Holman’s income subsequent to the February
    2010 order, and calculated the amount by which Mr. Holman had underpaid spousal
    support. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Taking into account the adjustments he made to child and spousal
    support, and the child support paid after the date on which he had found that
    child support should have terminated, the motion judge ordered Ms. Holman to
    reimburse Mr. Holman in the amount of $40,287. </span></p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arguments on Appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Ms. Holman makes several arguments on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Holman challenges the motion judge’s order for termination of
    spousal support effective November 15, 2013, arguing that the motion judge
    failed to find a material change justifying a variation in the indefinite order
    of spousal support originally made.  Ms. Holman argues that the motion judge failed
    to consider what the SSAGs say about the duration of support in long-term
    marriages, and overemphasized the goal of self-sufficiency while underemphasizing
    the compensatory nature of her claim to support. In addition, she claims that
    the motion judge erred in failing to consider the <em>without child</em> formula under the SSAGs, which applies in so-called “crossover cases” in which
    the child support obligation has ended.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, with respect to child support, Ms. Holman does not dispute
    the termination of child support ordered by the motion judge, other than to
    submit that child support for K. should have been terminated on June 1, 2013,
    rather than May 1, 2013. However, she contends that the motion judge erred in
    calculating the child support reimbursement to which Mr. Holman was entitled
    by: (a) failing to increase child support based on Mr. Holman’s increased
    income as required by the 2009 and 2010 orders; (b) finding that child support
    for one child is 50 percent of the amount for two children, which is contrary
    to the CSGs; (c) refunding $12,000 to Mr. Holman for what K. should have
    contributed to her s. 7 expenses; and (d) double-counting a portion of the
    child support overpayment by deducting it from the spousal support
    underpayment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Holman submits that the motion judge did not err in calculating
    the child support reimbursement, but concedes that the motion judge overstated
    by $1,731 the child support payments actually made. Mr. Holman argues that the motion
    judge was entitled to depart from the CSGs on a motion to change, and did not
    err in doing so. He submits that the motion judge correctly terminated spousal
    support on the basis of Ms. Holman’s self-sufficiency as well as the relative
    capital positions of the parties.</span></p>

    support variation order:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a) recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to
    the former spouses arising from the marriage or its           breakdown;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b) apportion between the former spouses any financial

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge explicitly referred
    to and considered these objectives.  He was alive to and considered the
    compensatory nature of Ms. Holman’s claim. He was aware of the economic
    disadvantages she suffered as a result of the family decision to have her stay
    home and care for the children. He was aware that corresponding economic
    advantages were conferred on Mr. Holman. He discussed these at length. At the
    same time, the motion judge concluded that at about 11.5 years following
    separation, Ms. Holman had achieved self-sufficiency. He observed that her
    inheritance increased her means and allowed her to purchase a home relatively
    free from debt. And, having considered all of the necessary factors, he made a
    discretionary decision about the appropriate duration of support. In my view,
    this decision was open to him on the evidence and was not clearly wrong or an
    error in principle. Accordingly, his decision is entitled to deference from
    this court.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Ms. Holman argues that the motion judged erred by terminating
    spousal support 11.5 years after separation.  While I am sympathetic to Ms.
    Holman’s argument, in my view, the alleged overemphasis on the goal of
    self-sufficiency while underemphasizing the compensatory nature of her claim
    amounts to a criticism of the motion judge’s balancing of factors rather than to
    an error in principle.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, I agree that it would have been

    recommended in the SSAGs and explain his choice of duration towards the lower

lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the same time, the duration ordered does fall
    within the SSAG range.  Since spousal support in long marriages has both
    compensatory and non-compensatory features, the motion judge’s finding of self-sufficiency
    was not irrelevant.  And since there remains discretion to select a duration
    within the range set out by the SSAGs, I am not persuaded that the motion
    judge’s decision to terminate support on November 15, 2013 constitutes
    reversible error.</span></p>

    payable post child-support obligations, I would, however, agree with Ms. Holman
    that the motion judge erred in principle in failing to increase spousal support
    after May 1, 2013.  The SSAGs specify at ss. 8.11 and 14.5 that a so-called
    “crossover” to the <em>without child</em> formula is appropriate after child
    support obligations cease.   According to the <em>without child</em> formula, and
    based on their 2012 incomes of $129,616 and $50,360 respectively, Mr. Holman’s
    spousal support obligation between May 1, 2013 and November 15, 2013 should
    have been between $1,882/month and $2,510/month for 6.5 months.  </span></p>

    2012 education and living expenses. The parties had agreed in the 2009 and 2010
    orders that Mr. Holman would pay $10,000 per year towards the children’s annual
    university costs as long as the children were enrolled in a post-secondary

    entitled to the full $12,000 credit. Any contribution by K. should reduce the
    portion of her expenses paid by <em>both</em> parents. As pointed out by Ms.
    Holman, Mr. Holman was responsible for paying only $5,000 per year towards each
    child’s post-secondary education, totaling $10,000 for K. for 2011 and 2012. To
    the extent that this credit related to K.’s education expenses, Mr. Holman
    cannot receive a $12,000 refund for a payment of $10,000. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I see no basis to interfere with the motion
    judge’s determination that Mr. Holman should be credited something for what K.
    should have contributed. Section 7(2) of the CSGs requires the court to
    consider whether a child of majority age is able to make a contribution to his
    or her post-secondary education expenses and sets out the guiding principle
    that these expenses are to be shared by the spouses in proportion to their respective
    incomes. In the parties’ 2004 consent divorce judgment, it was agreed that s. 7
    expenses would be shared with Mr. Holman paying two-thirds of these expenses,
    and Ms. Holman paying one-third. I would adopt the agreement of the parties in
    this respect, and credit two-thirds of the $12,000, namely $8,000, to Mr.

    one child (January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2013), the motion judge calculated that

    inappropriate for a child over the age of majority, the court may order the
    amount of support “that it considers appropriate, having regard to the

    ground of appeal. Ms. Holman brought no evidence to the attention of the court about
