    comes before this court. The appellant, American Home Assurance Company
    (“American Home”), disputes its liability for defence costs under a directors’

    respondent, Onex Corporation (“Onex”). The personal respondents were directors

    American Home appealed the summary judgment granted in the respondents’ action claiming
    reimbursement for defence costs in an action pursuant to certain D&amp;O policies
    issued by American Home. Contrary to the finding of the motion judge, this court
    found ambiguity in an endorsement to one of the relevant policies. It allowed
    American Home's appeal, set aside the order of the motion judge, and returned
    the matter to the Superior Court to hear evidence to resolve the ambiguity.</span></p>

    covered officers and directors of Onex and its subsidiaries in respect of
    liability for claims first made against them and reported during the policy
    period. It had an aggregate limit of liability for all loss, including defence
    costs, of US$15 million. Onex also purchased excess insurance, giving it
    D&amp;O liability coverage of US$60 million for the period from November 29,

    bankruptcy, Aon Reed Stenhouse (“Aon”), an insurance broker who acted as agent
    and broker for Onex and Magnatrax, asked American Home to bind coverage for a
    run-off D&amp;O policy for Magnatrax. On May 12, 2003, American Home issued a temporary
    and conditional binder of coverage for Executive and Organization Liability
    Policy number 350 35 03, for the period May 12, 2003 to May 12, 2009, with a

    Magnatrax or its executives. </span></p>

    contained specific entity subsidiary exclusions, which were identical to

    agreed to remove the specific entity subsidiary exclusion from the 2004-2005 Onex

    the benefit of Onex and its executives (the “Georgia Action”). The Georgia
    Action described the individual respondents as executives of both Onex and

    Onex Policy. It relied on Endorsement #14 (specific entity subsidiary
    exclusion), which it submitted excluded coverage for any Magnatrax-related
    claims. In the alternative, American Home claimed that any monies owing under
    the 2002-2003 Onex Policy could be set off against the monies already paid out
    under the Run-Off Policy pursuant to Endorsement #16 (coordination of limits
    endorsement).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both parties moved for summary judgment. The
    motion judge held that the 2002-2003 Onex Policy provided coverage for Onex and
    its executives for defence costs incurred in connection with the Georgia Action
    and denied American Home’s claim for set off pursuant to Endorsement #16. American
    Home was ordered to pay the US$15 million limit to Onex and the individual
    respondents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, this court considered the wording of the
    2002-2003 Onex Policy, focusing on the meaning of the word “Claim” in both the
    first and second paragraphs of Endorsement #14 (specific entity subsidiary
    exclusion). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted above, the first paragraph of
    Endorsement #14 provides that American Home has no liability “for </span>any
    Loss alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to or in connection
    with any Claim brought by or made against” Magnatrax. The second paragraph
    provides there is no coverage for “any Loss in connection with any Claim made
    against an Insured alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to any
    breach of duty, act, error or omission of MAGNATRAX Corporation, or any
    director, officer, member of the board of managers or employee thereof.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court found that the wording of Endorsement
    #14 is ambiguous because the word “Claim” is susceptible to more than one
    meaning. On the one hand, “Claim” can be interpreted to encompass only an
    entire civil proceeding without differentiating between the allegations or
    specific “claims” within that proceeding. On the other hand, “Claim” can be
    construed to refer to each of the several bases for relief made within a single
    civil proceeding. The question whether coverage is excluded turns on this
    distinction because the Georgia Action – one “claim” in the “civil proceeding”
    sense – asserts several “claims” in the “claim for relief” sense.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court concluded it was not in a position to
    resolve the ambiguity </span><em>de novo</em><span lang=EN-US> because it
    lacked the evidence necessary to determine which interpretation reflected the
    parties’ reasonable expectations or intentions in adopting Endorsement #14. The
    court set aside the summary judgment and sent the matter back to the Superior

  <p class=CQuote>We have examined the record carefully. Regrettably, we find
    that we are not in a position to decide the factual issues that need to be
    determined in order to resolve the interpretative dispute. Having found that
    Endorsement 14 was unambiguous, the motion judge did not make findings of fact
    with respect to the issues we consider relevant to the resolution of the
    interpretation exercise.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In arguing the appeal, the parties each took the position that
    the interpretation they urged on the court was unambiguous. That being the
    case, they paid little attention to&nbsp;the issues that we now find must be
    determined -- what were the reasonable expectations or intentions of the parties
    in adopting Endorsement #14 of the Onex 2002-2003 Policy?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given the disposition we would make of this appeal, we will not
    express an opinion on the body of evidence that may be relevant to determining
    that issue. Suffice it to say that there is evidence of discussions and

    about which the parties agreed, namely:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) The Onex 2002-2003 Policy is the relevant Onex Policy.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) Of the wrongful acts mentioned in the Georgia Action with respect
    to Magnatrax, some were alleged to have been committed by Onex directors in
    their capacity as directors of Onex. Others were alleged to have been committed
    by Onex directors in their capacity as directors of Magnatrax.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) The allegations made in the Georgia Action of wrongful acts
    committed by Onex directors in their capacity as Onex directors, fell within
    the grant of coverage in the 2002-2003 Onex Policy.</p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge reviewed the chronology of
    Onex’s incorporation of Magnatrax and the liability policies it purchased. Hano
    Pak, an underwriter for American Home, gave evidence that Onex wanted to keep
    Magnatrax-related claims in a separate policy so it would not impact Onex’s
    limits with respect to other business going forward. According to Pak, American
    Home wanted everything to do with Magnatrax to be on one policy so that only
    one policy limit would respond to any claim in connection with Magnatrax.
    Jonathan Ashall, a vice president at Aon, gave evidence that he wanted full
    coverage for the Onex executives and was concerned about possible gaps in
    coverage. He was trying to find solutions to protect Onex and its executives.
    Andrew Brown of Aon also gave evidence about several different versions of
    policy wordings that had been circulated. </span></p>

    Policy and the Onex policies </span>w<span lang=EN-US>as not finalized until
    July 2005. While there was a tentative agreement in January 2003 to keep
    everything Magnatrax-related in the Run-Off Policy, this was never finalized or
    included in an agreement. In January 2003, the parties did not discuss the
    meaning of the word “Claim”, nor did they discuss the “dual capacity” issue,
    that is, whether both policies could be triggered if Onex executives were sued
    in two different capacities (as executives of Magnatrax and as executives of
    Onex). </span></p>

    was finally settled in July 2005, all parties mutually agreed that Endorsement #4
    (co-defendant carve-out endorsement) of the Run-Off Policy would not cover Onex
    executives acting in their capacity as Onex executives, and that Endorsement #14
    of the 2002-2003 Onex Policy would not exclude coverage for Onex executives acting
    as such in relation to Magnatrax. The Run-Off Policy would, however, cover Onex
    executives acting in their capacity as Magnatrax executives before May 2003;
    the Onex Policy would not.</span></p>

    mutual intention and did not add any qualifications or say that the Onex Policy
    would not provide coverage if the executives were sued in both capacities in
    the same action. This was because all parties understood that the two policies
    provided different coverage for Onex executives for different wrongful acts
    committed in different capacities. </span></p>

    remove the specific entity subsidiary exclusion from the 2004-2005 Onex Policy and
    replace it with a prior acts exclusion that would not exclude coverage for Onex
    executives acting in their capacity as such. Pak explained that the parties did
    not</span><span lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>remove Endorsement #14, the
    specific entity subsidiary exclusion, from the 2002-2003 Onex Policy because
    they regarded that policy as obsolete. Both parties assumed the 2004-2005 Onex
    Policy would respond to the Georgia Action because Aon sent a copy of the
    complaint in that action to American Home as notice of a claim under the 2004-2005
    Onex Policy. The parties failed to recognize that notice of the claim was made on
    November 28, 2003, the day before the 2002-2003 Onex Policy expired, when Aon
    forwarded a letter from the firm Foley &amp; Lardner, counsel for the Magnatrax
    Creditors’ Committee, to American Home (the “Foley Letter”).<a href="#_ftn4"

    Issues of contractual interpretation in these circumstances are issues of mixed
    fact and law that ordinarily attract review on a deferential standard.

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>American Home advanced careful and comprehensive

    scratch in considering the interpretation of Endorsement #14. That is because this
    court<span lang=EN-US> did not leave the entire interpretive exercise to the
    trial judge. Rather, this court resolved many of the issues and sent the matter
    back for the Superior Court judge to determine the meaning of the ambiguous

    arguments did not rely on the extrinsic evidence led at trial, they are merely
    repetitions of arguments previously advanced before this court. The summary of these
    arguments in the court’s previous decision satisfies me that they are the same
    arguments, perhaps refined, that are advanced before us in this appeal. In my

    as tenable the motion judge’s conclusion, at para. 54, that “the “definition of
    Claim is broad enough to also encompass multiple individual claims within an
    action or proceeding as well. It is not restricted to mean solely an action or
    proceeding&quot;. In taking that view, this court reviewed the wording of the
    entire policies at issue, and <span lang=EN-US>said at paragraph 156:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In assessing the reasonableness of the competing
    interpretations of the term &quot;Claim&quot; in Endorsement #14, it is
    necessary to consider if each interpretation is consistent with the use of that
    term elsewhere in the Onex 2002-2003 Policy. We have reviewed the language of
    the policy, and in particular have examined Endorsements #5 and #9. American
    Home contended that the language of these endorsements supports its
    interpretation of Endorsement #14. <em>We conclude that the way the term

    factual matrix in which the policies were negotiated makes evident that the
    intention was that coverage for Magnatrax-related claims be excluded under the
    2002-2003 Onex policy. Before the Run-Off Policy was purchased, there was US$15
    million in coverage under the 2002-2003 Onex Policy for all wrongful acts and
    claims against all executives and subsidiaries, including Magnatrax. The
    parties arranged the Run-Off Policy and added Endorsement #14 to the Onex policy
    because of Magnatrax’s impending bankruptcy. According to American Home, the
    purpose of these arrangements was to isolate claims against Magnatrax in order
    to preserve the US$15 million coverage of the Onex policy for all other
    ventures. The expectation was that at the time of the bankruptcy, Onex would
    have no further connection with Magnatrax and any potential claims against
    Magnatrax would crystallize as of the date of bankruptcy. To give effect to
    this, coverage under the Run-Off Policy commenced as of the bankruptcy and
    continued for six years until limitation periods would expire. Onex never took
    up excess insurance for Magnatrax. Endorsement #14 (specific entity subsidiary
    exclusion) was added to properly mirror the coverage that had previously been
    available for Magnatrax-related claims under the Onex policy when Magnatrax was
    an Onex subsidiary.</span></p>

    view supported by the objective factual matrix. The court specifically stated
    it had considered the factual matrix and that commercially reasonable arguments
    could be made to support both of the competing interpretations. At paras. 132 and
    165 the court said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>We have considered the language of Endorsement #14 of the Onex
    2002-2003 Policy in the context of the surrounding circumstances or the factual
    matrix. In our view, the language viewed in that context is ambiguous. It is
    open to two reasonable interpretations: the one urged by American Home and the
    one adopted by the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>… The factual matrix in this case does not resolve which

    begin with the language of the agreement and then resort to further evidence
    only when necessary. Instead, the trial judge started her contractual
    interpretation with a consideration of extrinsic evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument has no merit. As explained above, the trial judge was not tasked with
    considering the matter afresh. The Court of Appeal had already made findings
    about the wording of the policies read as a whole in the context of the
    surrounding circumstances and factual matrix. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, American Home had agreed before the trial judge that the allegations
    made in the Georgia Action with respect to wrongful acts of Onex executives
    committed within their capacity as Onex executives fell within the grant of
    coverage in the 2002-2003 Onex Policy. The trial judge had the narrow task of
    considering whether the conceded coverage was excluded by Endorsement #14 in
    light of extrinsic evidence, especially evidence of the discussions and
    correspondence that took place in January 2003 and again at the time of the
    issuance of the Run-Off Policy and Endorsement #14.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 20 of her reasons, the trial judge set out what she considered to be the
    specific question that this court directed her to resolve: “Does Endorsement #14
    … to the Onex Policy exclude from coverage, those claims advanced in the [Georgia
    Action] alleging wrongful acts on the part of the Onex directors said to have
    been committed in their capacity as Onex Directors?”  I agree that that is
    precisely the exercise this court assigned to her. In that exercise, the burden
    of proof was on American Home to establish that the exclusion plainly removed
    the claim from coverage. The trial judge cited ample authority for this
    well-established principle at para. 212 of her reasons.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits the trial judge erred in giving effect to what she
    found were the subjective intentions of the parties, and thereby granted “rectification
    by interpretation”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American
    Home submits that the trial judge used direct evidence of the parties’
    subjective intentions to overwhelm the language of the policy, and in effect,
    granted rectification by giving effect to those subjective intentions. The appellant
    notes that the respondents did not seek rectification in this case and, in any
    event, submits they could not have possibly satisfied the strict test for rectification.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American
    Home’s argument centres on the evidence of Pak and the trial judge’s treatment
    of that evidence. Pak negotiated the Run-Off Policy and several Onex policies
    on behalf of American Home. The wording of the policies was not finalized until
    July 2005. At that time, Pak agreed with Brown that a specific entity
    subsidiary endorsement identical to Endorsement #14 <span lang=EN-US>(specific
    entity subsidiary exclusion)</span> had been mistakenly added to successive
    versions of the Onex policy. Pak, in contradiction to the submission of counsel
    for American Home, testified that Endorsement #4 <span lang=EN-US>(co-defendant
    carve-out endorsement) </span>of the Run-Off Policy did not provide coverage
    for Onex executives acting in their capacity as Onex executives when sued in
    connection with Magnatrax. As well, Brown and Pak agreed the specific entity
    subsidiary exclusion in the Onex policies could potentially be construed to
    exclude coverage under the Onex policy for Onex executives acting in their
    capacity as Onex executives in relation to Magnatrax. In an email dated July 5,
    2005 that Brown sent to Pak confirming the changes they discussed, Brown indicates
    the concern that “Excluding claims against the specified entity and “any
    insureds thereof” <span class=Underline>might have been misinterpreted</span> to mean that this individual was excluded altogether”. As the trial judge
    found, Pak agreed with this and consequently, in July 2005, he and Brown removed
    the specific entity subsidiary exclusion from the 2004-2005 Onex Policy then in
    force and replaced it with a prior acts endorsement (Endorsement #13) that did
    not remove or exclude any coverage from the Onex policy for Onex executives acting
    in their capacity as Onex executives in relation to Magnatrax.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pak
    gave evidence that when the specific entity subsidiary exclusion was deleted
    from the 2004-2005 Onex Policy, he and Brown did not discuss revising the
    2002-2003 Onex Policy to replace the specific entity subsidiary exclusion in
    that policy with the prior acts exclusion (Endorsement #13) because they mistakenly
    believed that the 2002-2003 Onex Policy was spent. The 2002-2003 Onex Policy
    (like the other Onex D&amp;O policies) is a “claims made” policy, that is, it
    provides coverage for claims first made against an insured party during the
    policy period and reported to the insurer within the time frame defined in the
    policy. Pak and Brown assumed the 2002-2003 Onex Policy was spent because they
    did not believe any claims were made during the policy period. They had failed
    to recognize that a notice of claim had been provided by way of the Foley
    Letter in 2003.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    trial judge placed great weight on Pak’s testimony and the evidence about the
    agreement to remove the specific entity subsidiary exclusion from the 2004-2005
    Onex Policy, agreeing with the respondents that this evidence “‘changed the
    landscape’ of the interpretive exercise”. Based on this evidence, she concluded
    that the specific entity subsidiary exclusion “was not intended to be included
    in successive Onex primary policies, including the Onex 2002-2003 Policy, after
    May 12, 2003.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    American Home submits that the trial judge, in effect, used Pak’s direct
    evidence of the parties’ subjective intention to read Endorsement #14<span
lang=EN-US> (specific entity subsidiary exclusion)</span> out of the 2002-2003
    Onex Policy thereby granting “rectification by interpretation”. American Home
    further submits that the fact that the parties replaced the specific entity
    subsidiary exclusion in the 2004-2004 Onex Policy with the prior acts exclusion
    shows that they both regarded the wording of Endorsement #14 in the 2002-2003
    Onex Policy to exclude coverage for Onex executives acting in the capacity as
    such in relation to Magnatrax. American Home says the trial judge erred by giving
    effect to what she found was the parties’ mutual subjective intention rather
    than giving effect to the wording of the policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the submission. This court had already ruled that Endorsement #14
    was ambiguous and directed the trial judge to resolve the ambiguity after
    hearing evidence that included the “discussions and correspondence that took
    place in January 2003 and again at the time of the issuance of the Magnatrax
    Run-Off Policy and the issuance of Endorsement #14.” The trial judge did not
    use the extrinsic evidence to give effect to the parties’ mutual subjective
    intention; rather, she used it to resolve the ambiguity in the language of the
    endorsement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge expressly considered Endorsement #14 as properly included in the
    2002-2003 Onex Policy and concluded that, in light of the extrinsic evidence
    relating to the circumstances and discussions leading to the finalization of
    the policies, American Home’s position as to how the ambiguous word “Claim”
    should be interpreted was simply not tenable. The extrinsic evidence revealed
    that the parties’ mutually intended for the 2002-2003 Onex Policy to cover Onex
    executives for wrongful acts committed in their capacity as Onex executives. It
    was, therefore, “objectively unreasonable” to conclude that “Claim” referred
    only to an entire civil proceeding such that Endorsement #14<span lang=EN-US> (specific entity subsidiary exclusion)</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>would
    preclude Onex executives from receiving coverage for wrongful acts committed in
    their capacity as Onex executives contrary to the parties’ stated mutual intention. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge stated that had there been any lingering ambiguity in the
    meaning of “Claim”, she would have resolved it by applying the doctrine of <em>contra
    proferentem</em>, choosing the meaning resisted by the party who drafted the
    contract, American Home.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge points out, American Home conceded at the outset that the
    wrongful acts of Onex executives acting as Onex executives alleged in the
    Georgia Action fell within the grant of coverage of the Onex Policy and would be
    covered unless excluded by Endorsement #14. The onus was on American Home to
    show that the endorsement clearly and unequivocally removed coverage. The trial
    judge found that American Home had not satisfied that onus.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have not been persuaded that there is any basis to interfere with the trial
    judge’s conclusion. </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ISSUE 2: Is American Home entitled to set off the monies dues under the 2002-2003
    Onex Policy against the monies paid under the Run-Off Policy? </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second question on appeal is whether Endorsement #16 <span lang=EN-US>(coordination
    of limits endorsement) </span>of the Run-Off Policy entitles American Home to
    set off the US$15 million payable under the 2002-2003 Onex Policy against the
    monies it already paid under the Run-Off Policy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span

    #16 provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>In consideration of the premium charged, it is hereby
    understood and agreed that, with respect to any Claim under this policy for
    which coverage is provided by one or more other policies issued by the Insurer
    or any other member of the American International Group (AIG)</em>, (or would
    be provided but for the exhaustion of the limit of liability, the applicability
    of the retention/deductible amount or coinsurance amount, or the failure of the
    Insured to submit a notice of a Claim), <em>the Limit of Liability provided by
    virtue of this policy shall be reduced by the limit of liability provided by
    said other AIG policy</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Notwithstanding the above, in the event such other AIG policy
    contains a provision which is similar in intent to the foregoing paragraph,
    then the foregoing paragraph will not apply, but instead:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1.       the Insurer shall not be liable under this policy for
    a greater proportion of the Loss than the applicable Limit of Liability under
    this policy bears to the total limit of liability of all such policies, and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2.       the maximum amount payable under all such policies
    shall not exceed the limit of liability of the policy that has the highest
    available limit of liability.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nothing contained in this endorsement shall be construed to
    increase the limit of liability of this policy. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>American
    Home submits that the trial judge made an extricable legal error by using an
    incorrect interpretive approach in deriving the meaning of this endorsement. American
    Home points out that in its previous decision this court did not find that Endorsement
    #16 was ambiguous. The trial judge should, therefore, have begun by considering
    the wording of the endorsement, instead of immediately resorting to the
    extrinsic evidence as American Home submits she did.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the argument.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that the trial judge’s analysis began with a reference to the extrinsic
    evidence. She did so to highlight what both counsel had agreed before her:
    “that [the] parties intended that whatever coverage for Onex directors was
    provided by the [Run-Off Policy] would be taken away from the Onex 2002-2003
    Policy.” This agreed proposition was the springboard for the trial judge’s
    analysis of the wording of Endorsement #16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addressing the wording, the trial judge noted that the word &quot;Claim&quot;
    in Endorsement #16 was not used in isolation but was part of the phrase &quot;claim
    under this policy.&quot; In her view, American Home chose this wording so that
    Endorsement #16 applied to “allegations of wrongful acts limited to wrongful
    acts covered <span class=Underline>under the [Run-Off Policy]</span> i.e., wrongful
    acts committed by Magnatrax or Magnatrax directors [including those of Onex
    directors acting in their capacity as Magnatrax directors]” (emphasis in
    original): <em>Onex </em>(S.C. 2014), at para. 258. She added, at para. 258:</p>
  <p class=CQuote> It would strain the wording of &quot;<span class=Underline>claim
    under this policy</span>&quot; to interpret &quot;claim under <span
class=Underline>this</span> policy&quot; to extend beyond wrongful acts covered
    under the [Run-Off Policy] to include allegations of wrongful acts covered
    under the [Run-Off Policy] AND wrongful acts <strong>not</strong> covered under
    the [Run-Off Policy] [e.g., allegations of wrongful acts made against Onex
    directors acting in their capacity as Onex directors]. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me American Home’s failure on this issue follows from its failure on
    the first issue. In order for Endorsement #16 <span lang=EN-US>(coordination of
    limits endorsement)</span> to entitle American Home to a set off, the “dual
    capacity” interpretation would have to be rejected and the word “Claim” would
    have to be taken to mean a “civil proceeding” and not each allegation made within a
    civil proceeding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the meaning of “Claim” adopted under Issue 1 above, it follows that the trial
    judge’s reading of the language of Endorsement #16 is correct. The phrase
    “claim under this policy” indicates that Endorsement #16 has no application to
    allegations not covered at all under the Run-Off Policy.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For

    Policy was made in the alternative. Onex’s primary claim was that the
    respondents were covered by the D&amp;O liability insurance policy for the
    period 2004-2005. At the motion for summary judgment, the motion judge held
    that the 2002-2003 Onex Policy applied to the claims made in respect of the
    Georgia Action because the claim was made and reported prior to the expiration
    of the 2002-2003 policy period.</p>
