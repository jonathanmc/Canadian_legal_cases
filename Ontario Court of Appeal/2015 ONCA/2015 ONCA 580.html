  <p><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Weiler
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is about whether the respondent, 1196303 Ontario Ltd. (“119”),
    is entitled to money from the sale of a property, which has been paid into
    court. The basis put forward for the entitlement is a settlement agreement (the
    “Settlement”), entered into by 119 and 1297475 Ontario Inc. (“129”), which
    purported to place guarantee and security obligations on the owner of 2387
    Yonge Street in Toronto, the appellant Glen Grove Suites Inc. (“Glen Grove”).
    If Glen Grove is bound by the Settlement, 119 is entitled to those funds.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Glen Grove was bound by the Settlement.
    Although I disagree with his analysis, I agree that Glen Grove is liable on the
    Settlement and that 119 is entitled to the money. On the facts as found by the
    trial judge, 129 not only acted on its own behalf in agreeing to pay 119 the
    sum of $500,000, but also acted as Glen Grove’s agent in offering the guarantee
    and mortgage security provided for in the Settlement. I would therefore dismiss
    the appeal as it relates to Glen Grove.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found Spendthrift Development Ltd. (“Spendthrift”),
    a sister corporation to Glen Grove and 129, liable under the Settlement. In my
    view he erred in doing so. I would allow the appeal as it relates to Spendthrift.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidentiary Background</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Background to the
    Settlement </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Edwin Hyde, husband of Sylvia Hyde, was a lawyer and real estate
    developer who owned several companies. In 1990 and 1991, a group of investors
    loaned his companies several million dollars. The loans were secured by
    mortgages over various properties. In 1996, 119 also referred to in these
    reasons as the Receiver) was formed to represent these investors. It was
    appointed as Receiver, and in 1997, it petitioned Edwin into bankruptcy. The
    Receiver had a proof of claim for over $10.9 million.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Glen Grove and Spendthrift owned rental properties and condominiums.
    They owned valuable long-term leases on the Yonge Street Property (the
    “Property”). In 1993 and 1994, Edwin transferred his beneficial interest in the
    Property and 100% of the Glen Grove shares to his wife, Sylvia. He claimed it
    was a gift. Edwin’s creditors regarded both transfers from Edwin to Sylvia as
    reviewable transactions during Edwin’s 1997 bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time the Settlement was negotiated, Sylvia owned 100% of the
    shares in both Glen Grove and Spendthrift. She was the sole director and
    officer of these companies. She also owned 100% of the shares of 129, a shell
    corporation, and was a director and officer of this company, along with Edwin
    as officer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding her roles as sole shareholder and director, Sylvia had
    limited involvement in the affairs of her companies prior to Edwin’s death in
    May 2004. Edwin operated and managed the companies on her behalf. The trial
    judge found that Sylvia had given her husband <em>de facto</em> control and
    full authority to operate 129, Glen Grove, and Spendthrift and to enter into
    transactions binding these companies without obtaining transaction-specific
    consent from her. Sylvia would sign documents given to her by Edwin, without
    question.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Negotiating the
    Settlement</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1998, Glen Grove made three offers to Edwin’s trustee in bankruptcy
    to purchase the assets in his estate. Included in that purchase were any causes
    of action the Trustee had against Sylvia to set aside the transfer to her of
    Glen Grove shares and the interest in the Property as a preferential transfer. The
    result would have been that Sylvia’s ownership of the shares, and Glen Grove’s
    interest in the Property, would be secure. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offers were signed by Sylvia on behalf of Glen Grove. The offers
    were not accepted. Glen Grove made further offers between 1999 and 2002; again,
    these were refused. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2002, 129 made an offer to purchase the Receiver’s proof of claim against Edwin,
    as well as related debts (collectively, the “proof of claim”). Although
    different in form from the offers made by Glen Grove, this offer would have the
    same result, neutralizing any claims against Sylvia in relation to the 1994 share
    transfer and 1993 transfer of the interest in the Property. This offer and
    subsequent amendments (collectively referred to as the “Three Letters”, dated
    May 3, 2002, August 28, 2003, and October 3, 2003) formed the basis of the Settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Melvyn Solmon, 129’s lawyer, testified that the main purpose behind the
    offer to purchase Edwin’s debts was to shield Sylvia from any legal proceedings
    related to the share transfers. Solmon kept notes of conversations with Edwin,
    recording that “once sale through released s hyde from any claim – the chose in
    action has been sold” and “key no one can sue sylvia hyde once sale deal
    closed”. Emilio Bisceglia, a lawyer who acted for members of the Hyde family
    during Settlement discussions, also testified that one purpose of the
    Settlement was to purchase causes of action from the Trustee, including a cause
    of action related to the transfer to Sylvia of Glen Grove shares and the
    interest in the Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first of the three letters comprising the Settlement, dated May 3, 2002, elaborated
    the essential terms of the agreement. 129 would purchase the proof of claim for
    $527,408.50. The agreement outlined a payment plan: $27,408.50 was payable immediately
    upon execution of the minutes of settlement, in full satisfaction of the legal
    fees of Fred Tayar, 119’s lawyer; the balance of $500,000 was to be paid in
    accordance with a payment schedule.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    3 of the letter outlined terms for security for the payment:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As security for payment, the purchaser [129] will provide: </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>a) if the owner of the Glengrove property is able to do so
    using reasonable efforts, and acting in good faith, a mortgage, to be
    registered against the Glengrove property… </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>b) a guarantee from the owner of the Glengrove property
    guaranteeing the $500,000.00 balance owed; and, </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>c) a consent to judgment from the owner of the Glengrove
    property to be held in escrow providing for the full amount of $500,000.00.…  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    negotiations, 119 was insistent that the Settlement be backed by security. Edwin
    and Solmon discussed 119’s demand that some security be provided for the
    Settlement, at one point contemplating placing a mortgage on Edwin and Sylvia’s
    marital home. Finally, they determined that a mortgage might be arranged on the
    Glen Grove Property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Solmon
    testified that the “reasonable efforts” language in the text of the Settlement
    referred to the necessity of the Royal Bank, a priority mortgagee, consenting
    to any further encumbrances. Initially, Edwin indicated to Solmon that the Glen
    Grove mortgage would not be possible, as the Royal Bank was resistant to any
    further encumbrances. However, Edwin later sent Solmon marked up drafts of the Settlement,
    which included the obligation of Glen Grove to provide a mortgage. Solmon
    testified that, as a result, he understood that the mortgage could be placed on
    the Property and no problem existed with the Bank. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 18, 2003, in his role as corporate counsel for Glen Grove, Edwin sent a
    letter to Solmon enclosing a suggested payment program for the Settlement. The
    letter is signed: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Yours very truly GLENGROVE SUITES INC.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>PER: EDWIN G. HYDE, CORPORATE COUNSEL</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>It bears Edwin’s signature. Solmon testified that the
    enclosed payment program formed part of his instructions. It provided for a
    mortgage on the Glen Grove Property. Solmon testified that the person who
    provided him with instructions concerning the Settlement informed him that Glen
    Grove was prepared to guarantee the Settlement. The trial judge found that the
    person providing these instructions was Edwin.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 28, 2003, Solmon sent Tayar the second of the Three Letters, confirming
    that he had received instructions regarding amendments to the Settlement and a
    revised payment plan. The payment program outlined in the August 18 letter from
    Glen Grove, per Edwin, to Solmon is substantially similar to the terms outlined
    in the August 28 letter from Solmon to Tayar. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 30, 2003, Edwin sent Solmon a letter, asking him to review Tayar’s
    proposed Minutes of Settlement and providing further instructions regarding the
    Settlement. He enclosed a cheque for $27,408.50, “to be paid to Fred Tayer [<em>sic</em>]
    if the Minutes of Settlement are executed, or returned to us if they are not.”
    The cheque was from Glen Grove Management Inc.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 3, 2003, Solmon wrote to Tayar confirming the Settlement in the last of
    the Three Letters. The October 3 letter contained amendments to the payment
    schedule and the interest due, to account for the lapse of time between the
    Three Letters. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 7, 2003, Glen Grove Management Inc. provided two cheques for $15,000
    to Solmon. Both cheques were noted as being “re 1297475 Ont. Inc.”, and one of
    the cheques was signed by Sylvia. In a letter to Edwin dated November 7, 2003,
    Solmon confirmed receipt of the cheques, writing, “From those cheques
    $27,408.50 is being forwarded to Fred Tayar. We are returning to you the cheque
    which I have marked “cancelled” from Glengrove Management Inc. dated September
    30, 2003”. In his evidence at trial Solmon was asked, “And you do recall as
    well that there was part performance in the sense that there was a payment of
    $27,000 towards costs. That was one of the requirements in terms of the
    settlement, sir?” Solmon answered, “Yes.” The trial judge found that the
    November 7 cheques were for the legal fees referred to in the Settlement. In
    addition, Solmon acknowledged that Glen Grove Suites paid some of his legal
    fees such as his August 1, 2003 account.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
    on November 7, 2003, Solmon sent a memorandum to one of his associates
    instructing him “to arrange for the preparation of the necessary security
    documentation for the closing of the transaction involving Glengrove”. On
    February 12, 2004, this associate sent Solmon a memorandum enclosing draft settlement
    documentation, including a charge on the Property from Glen Grove to 1196306
    and a guarantee from Glen Grove for the debt incurred by 129. One of the
    recitals states, “The guarantor, Glen Grove, wishes to guarantee the debt owed
    by 129 with respect to the purchase of all debts, etc. set out in the Minutes
    of Settlement.”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fair inference can be drawn that 119 knew that Solmon was preparing the
    security from Glen Grove in accordance with the Settlement. As part of the
    security under the Settlement Glen Grove agreed to a consent to judgment
    against itself in the event 129 did not make the $500,000 payment. In his testimony,
    Solmon acknowledged that on February 12, 2004, he and Tayar had some technical
    discussion about the style of cause for the consent to judgment. The trial

    full terms of the Settlement were in place and his office had prepared the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span

    advised Sylvia in relation to the Settlement, and corresponded with Solmon on
    her behalf. Sylvia also discussed the Settlement with Solmon. In August 2004,
    Solmon sent Bisceglia the motion record for the approval motion and informed
    him that the motion was scheduled for October 4. He suggested they meet to
    discuss strategies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span

    August 30, Sylvia and Solmon spoke. Although he could not recall details, Solmon’s
    file notes included the statement “Sylvia will let the glengrove go”. Also on
    August 30, Sylvia sent Solmon documents, including 2003 financial statements
    for Glen Grove. She authorized him to contact an employee of a mortgagee of the
    Property, Eli Dadouch, who indicated there was equity in the Property – that
    “standalone glengrove suites is fine” – and that Sylvia had been taking out
    $20,000 per month for several years. On September 2, Solmon’s notes record a
    conversation with Sylvia in which she said “they will not go to court” on
    October 4, the date of the Settlement approval motion. Solmon also learned that
    Dadouch had been instructed not to discuss Glen Grove further with him.</p>

    Grove Suites”. These options were:</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Honour the Settlement
    (the letter indicated since Sylvia did not have sufficient funds “this is not

  <p class=BContinuingPara>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seek to amend
    the Settlement so that the full amount would be secured by a mortgage on the Property,

    representative of 129 attended the hearing. Solmon testified that between
    February and October 2004, the instructions he had received from 129 to consent
    to the Settlement never changed. He was, however, instructed not to attend
    court on the return date of October 4, 2004.</p>

    the Settlement. In addition to pursuing 129, 119 named Sylvia, Glen Grove, and
    Spendthrift as defendants. Sylvia, Glen Grove, and Spendthrift defended the
    action; 129 did not. Accordingly, on May 30, 2005, default judgment was granted
    against 129 requiring it to pay $619,383.56; to cause Spendthrift and Glen
    Grove to deliver a mortgage for $500,000 and a guarantee of 129’s indebtedness;

    and no dealings with 129 or 119 in respect of it. They also asserted that,
    although Sylvia was the nominal owner of 129, she had nothing to do with its
    operations and had no specific knowledge that it even existed. They also argued
    that 129 had not acted as their agent, but if it had, then 119 was estopped

    and findings of fact </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge conducted an extensive review of the evidence. Of note are the
    following findings:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sylvia was a director and sole shareholder of 129, Glen Grove,
    and Spendthrift, but prior to Edwin’s death in May 2004 she played little role
    in the companies’ affairs. Edwin had operated and managed them. Sylvia had
    given Edwin <em>de facto</em> control and full authority to operate the three
    companies and enter into transactions which bound those companies without
    requiring transaction-specific consent from her. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on documents Sylvia had signed dating back to 1998, the trial
    judge rejected Sylvia’s contention that she did not know about 129 prior to the
    lawsuit.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Edwin possessed full authority to enter into the Settlement. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following Edwin’s death, control over 129, Glen Grove, and
    Spendthrift passed to Sylvia.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During negotiations, Sylvia was aware that a settlement was under
    discussion. She learned of the precise terms of the Settlement after Edwin’s
    death and before it was approved by the court on October 4, 2004. By no later
    than August 2004, she understood that the Settlement involved Glen Grove’s
    providing a mortgage on the property and guaranteeing 129’s obligations under
    the Settlement. There was no other explanation for Sylvia’s providing Solmon
    with financial information concerning Glen Grove or consenting that he discuss
    Glen Grove’s affairs with Dadouch. Further, the letter from Solmon to Sylvia dated
    September 20, 2004, made the security aspects of the Settlement clear.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to the making of the approval order, Sylvia was aware that
    the court would be asked to approve the Settlement proposed by her company,
    129, and she received independent legal advice about her options. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sylvia did not alter the instructions previously given by Edwin –
    that 129 consented to the Receiver’s placing the Settlement before the court
    for approval. She made no effort to inform the Receiver that 129 no longer
    wished to proceed with the Settlement, or that any risk existed that her
    corporations would not perform the steps set out in it. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following court approval of the Settlement, Sylvia did not intend
    to cause 129 to fulfill any of its obligations, even though it lay fully within
    her control to do so. After default judgment was obtained, despite controlling
    129, Glen Grove, and Spendthrift, Sylvia decided that the latter two would not
    perform the acts specified in the default judgment. She made a decision to permit
    the Settlement to be placed before the court for approval, while knowing that
    the obligations outlined in the Settlement would not be fulfilled.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Trial Judge’s Analysis </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that the Settlement was binding on Glen Grove and Spendthrift,
    but not Sylvia personally. The core of his holding is that: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[W]here companies intimately connected in interest are used by
    a common controlling mind in combination to secure a court-approved benefit,
    they cannot subsequently be used by the common controlling mind to avoid
    performing the obligations which arose from their earlier combined action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of this holding, the trial judge relied on a decision involving privies
    to prior litigation, in which the doctrine of issue estoppel applied, and extended
    its application to this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the only reason Edwin was able to propose that security
    on the Glen Grove Property would form part of the Settlement was his common <em>de
    facto </em>control of 129, Glen Grove, and Spendthrift. He exercised that unity
    of <em>de facto </em>control with Sylvia’s permission, and upon his death, that
    control passed into Sylvia’s hands. If Edwin had not died before the court
    approved the order, the terms of the Settlement would have been fulfilled. Sylvia
    knew about the Settlement before its court approval and, armed with legal
    advice about her options and possessing unity of control over 129, Glen Grove,
    and Spendthrift, she permitted the Settlement to be placed before the court for
    approval. She could have instructed counsel to inform the Receiver or the court
    that she did not want her company to proceed with the Settlement. Instead, the Settlement
    received court approval, and Sylvia received that which Edwin had sought –
    certainty that his 1994 transfer to her of Glen Grove shares would not be set
    aside. Having used her companies in combination following Edwin’s death to
    secure a court-approved benefit, Sylvia could not subsequently erect their
    separate legal personalities as barriers to performing the obligations that
    secured the benefit. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted, without elaboration, Glen Grove’s argument that 129 was
    not acting as an agent, but noted that it did not help them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge determined that the corporate veil should not be pierced to attach
    personal liability to Sylvia or her estate. He found the evidence did not
    disclose that any of 129, Glen Grove, or Spendthrift was used as a shield for a
    fraudulent or improper purpose, which he noted was one of the requirements to
    pierce the veil.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The impugned findings
    of fact</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant takes issue with several of the trial judge’s findings of fact. In
    particular, the appellant submits: 1) the evidence demonstrated that Sylvia had
    no knowledge of the Settlement or of the existence of 129; 2) to the extent the
    trial judge found that Sylvia had control over 129, Glen Grove, and
    Spendthrift, this finding was an error; and 3) there was no evidence to support
    the trial judge’s finding that “had Edwin not died before the Approval Order
    was made, the terms of the Settlement Agreement would have been fulfilled”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject the appellant’s submissions. The trial judge’s finding that Sylvia
    had knowledge of the existence of 129 is supported by the fact that her signature
    is on numerous documents relating to the company dating back to 1998. Similarly,
    the trial judge drew a reasonable inference that although Sylvia was not
    involved in developing the Settlement, she knew settlement discussions were
    taking place. For example, Solmon testified about Edwin’s refusal to
    countenance a mortgage on the family home due to Sylvia’s reluctance. As well, one
    of the cheques for $15,000, used to pay 119’s legal fees as required under the
    Settlement, was noted as being “re 1297475 Ont. Inc.” and was signed by Sylvia. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    regards the appellant’s second contention, the trial judge did not find that
    Sylvia was exercising control over the companies prior to Edwin’s death. On the
    contrary, he found that she had delegated this control to her husband. This
    finding was reasonable on the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s finding that Sylvia controlled 129 after Edwin’s death was also eminently
    reasonable. Sylvia was the sole shareholder and, after Edwin’s death, the sole
    officer and director of 129 (although Robert Carberry was authorized to sign
    for the company). And the evidence revealed that after Edwin died, Sylvia was
    in possession of the motion materials and corresponded extensively about the
    Settlement with Solmon and Bisceglia. The appellant relies on a letter sent
    from Solmon to Tayar on February 9, 2004, in support of its contention that
    Carberry, not Sylvia, controlled 129. However, Solmon later explicitly
    testified he had no independent knowledge of who controlled 129. The trial
    judge’s finding that Sylvia controlled 129 after Edwin’s death is amply
    supported by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the finding that Edwin would have fulfilled the terms of the Settlement had he
    lived was reasonable. Solmon testified that the purpose of the Settlement was
    to remove any risk that Edwin’s transfer to Sylvia of Glen Grove shares and an
    interest in the Property could be challenged, and that 119 would only agree to
    the Settlement if it was backed by security. Edwin could not achieve his goal
    without Glen Grove’s providing the security under the Settlement. Solmon also
    testified about the instructions Edwin gave him with respect to entering into
    the Settlement, and in particular, his instructions that Glen Grove was prepared
    to provide the security called for by the Settlement. The appellant’s argument
    that Sylvia might not have agreed to the obligations assigned to Glen Grove
    under the Settlement is irrelevant: she had given Edwin authority to act for
    Glen Grove and did not interfere with his decisions. It was reasonable for the
    trial judge to infer this dynamic would have continued had Edwin lived.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Was Glen Grove bound
    by the Settlement?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant objects to the trial judge’s holding that Glen Grove and Spendthrift
    were liable under the Settlement due to Sylvia’s common control of her three
    companies. The appellant submits that the trial judge’s decision disregarded two
    fundamental legal principles: the doctrine of privity of contract, namely, that
    only the parties to a contract are bound by it; and the principle that corporations
    have a separate legal personality, first recognized in <em>Salomon v. Salomon
    &amp; Co.</em>,<em> </em>[1897] A.C. 22 (U.K.H.L.). The appellant submits that
    the trial judge disregarded both these principles and erroneously imposed
    liability on the basis of the “privity principle”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that differ from those of the trial judge, I am of the opinion that he

  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The trial judge’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated, at para. 119 of his reasons: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he law will only hold parties to a contract liable for its
    terms and obligations. As a matter of general principle, of course that is
    true. However, while the separate legal personality of corporate entities must
    be given recognition when those entities are operated as separate entities, the
    same respect need not be accorded to the separate legal personalities when,

    separate legal personalities are then erected as barriers to performing the
    obligations which secured the benefit.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge supported this proposition of law by reference to a single
    decision, that of Thorburn J. in <em>Martinez de Morales v. Lafontaine-Rish
    Medical Group Ltd.</em> (2009)<em>, </em>178 A.C.W.S. (3d) 36, aff’d 2010 ONCA
    59, 184 A.C.W.S. (3d) 373. That case dealt with the principle of <em>res
    judicata</em> and the privies to prior litigation. The trial judge acknowledged
    that <em>res judicata</em> did not formally arise on the facts of the present case.
    However, he held at para. 121 that: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he privity principle reflects a broader view that the law
    does not countenance a “lie-in-the-weeds” attitude by those whose interests are
    so intimately connected on a matter. In my view, in the present case, that
    attitude of the law is better expressed by stating that where companies
    intimately connected in interest are used by a common controlling mind in
    combination to secure a court-approved benefit, they cannot subsequently be
    used by the common controlling mind to avoid performing the obligations which
    arose from their earlier combined action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Martinez</em>, the plaintiff underwent cosmetic surgery in 2007 at the
    LaFontaine Clinic, located at 890 Yonge St. in Toronto. Prior to 2003, LaFontaine-Rish
    Medical Group Ltd. (LRMG) operated a cosmetic surgery clinic at that location.
    After 2003, LaFontaine Jeunesse Corporation (LJC) operated a clinic at the same
    location using the same key employees. Following her surgery, the plaintiff
    developed a serious infection and brought an action against LRMG. LRMG
    deliberately chose not to file a defence, and the plaintiff obtained default
    judgment against it. However, LRMG had no assets and had been inactive since
    2003.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff then realized that she had sued the wrong company and that she should
    have sued LJC. She amended her statement of claim to include LJC as a defendant,
    and argued that the doctrine of issue estoppel should apply to prevent LJC from
    raising the same issues about liability and damages that had been decided in
    the claim against LRMG. She submitted that LJC should be bound by the default
    judgment against LRMG. The two issues Thorburn J. had to determine were: (1)
    whether there was a sufficient nexus between LRMG and LJC to find that LJC was
    a privy of LRMG; and 2) if LJC was a privy, whether it should be been bound by
    the judgment obtained against LRMG. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thorburn
    J. held that LJC was a privy of LRMG. She began by observing, at para. 21 of
    her reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Privity is established if there is a sufficient degree of
    identification between two parties such that it would be just to hold that the
    decision rendered against one should be binding on the other. The concept of
    privity is somewhat elastic and thus, the determination as to whether there is
    privity must be made on a case by case basis. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    rejected LJC’s argument that the companies could not be privies because they
    were separately incorporated and did not enter into contracts on behalf of one
    another. She held there was privity, having regard to the fact that litigation
    management for both was under the exclusive authority of the same principal,
    and that the two companies operated the same clinic one after the other, using
    the same key employees, in the same premises, with the same telephone number
    and website.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thorburn
    J. then considered whether issue estoppel applied. LJC was not estopped from
    litigating the issues of liability and damages simply because it was LRMG’s
    privy. Thorburn J. noted that a non-party privy will be estopped from
    proceeding to trial in a subsequent proceeding on the same issue only if it had
    knowledge of the prior proceedings, a clear interest in them, and an
    opportunity to intervene as a participant to protect its interest. She held
    that these requirements had been fulfilled and that, as a result, LJC could not
    relitigate the issues of liability and damages, which had already been
    determined in the prior proceeding. LJC was bound by the default judgment that
    had been obtained against LRMG. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to note that in <em>Martinez</em>, privity and issue estoppel did
    not form the basis of LJC’s liability: its negligent actions did. The finding
    of privity and the application of issue estoppel precluded LJC from disputing
    that the clinic which performed the plaintiff’s surgery acted negligently and
    caused her injuries, and the quantum of damages. The only real question was
    which company had performed the surgery. That company was LJC, which operated
    the clinic after 2003. And Thorburn J. emphasized that because the plaintiff’s
    claim was that LJC, not LRMG, was responsible for her injuries, she was not
    entitled to recover damages from both companies. Thorburn J. therefore made
    judgment against LJC conditional on the plaintiff consenting to stay execution
    of the judgment against LRMG. In other words, the finding of privity did not
    allow the plaintiff to hold both companies responsible, only the one which had
    negligently performed the surgery.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Privity,
    in this context, simply means that if a privy passively stands by and does not
    intervene in a prior legal proceeding in which it has an interest, the privy is
    bound by that decision on the <em>res judicata </em>principle. <span
lang=EN-US>As the trial judge acknowledged, </span><em>res judicata </em><span

    of his reasons, were as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Defendants contended that there was no evidence tendered

    conclusion that the trial judge ignored important relevant evidence. He ought

  <p class=CQuote>Agency is the relationship that exists between two persons when

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    agency is often created by an express contract, setting out the scope of the
    agent’s authority, the creation of an agency relationship may be implied from
    the conduct or situation of the parties: see <em>Francis v. Dingman</em> (1983), 2 D.L.R. (4th) 244 (Ont. C.A.), per Lacourciere J.A., at p. 250, leave
    to appeal to S.C.C. refused, (1984) 23 B.L.R. 234n. Whether an agency
    relationship exists is ultimately a question of fact, to be determined in the light
    of the surrounding circumstances: <em>Ogdensburg Bridge &amp; Port Authority et
    al. v. Edwardsburg (Township)</em> (1966), 59 D.L.R. (2d) 537 (Ont. C.A.), at

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cumulative effect of the evidence leads me to conclude that Glen Grove and 129
    intended to create an agency relationship, and that Glen Grove authorized 129
    to act as its agent in negotiating and providing security under the Settlement.
    That evidence includes:  </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Glen Grove had previously made three offers to the Trustee to
    purchase the assets in Edwin’s estate. The offers made by both Glen Grove and
    129 had the same purpose: to ensure Sylvia’s ownership of Glen Grove shares
    would not be challenged. This is a contextual factor in assessing whether 129
    was carrying out a task assigned to it by Glen Grove.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>129 was not an active company. It had no bank account. During the
    course of negotiations, it was understood by all parties that 129 had no
    assets, that there was not enough money to immediately pay money due under the Settlement,
    and that some security would have to be provided. The Receiver was adamant that
    there would be no agreement without security. That security could only come
    from Glen Grove. Glen Grove paid some of 129’s legal fees. These facts support
    an inference that 129 was not simply acting on its own behalf but as Glen
    Grove’s agent.  </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Settlement required that 129 pay the Receiver’s counsel his
    fees of $27,408.50. On September 30, 2003, Edwin sent Solmon a cheque “to be
    paid to Fred Tayer [<em>sic</em>] if the Minutes of Settlement are executed”.
    This cheque was later cancelled, and in November 2003, Edwin sent two new
    cheques of $15,000. Solmon then paid Tayar’s fees. All the cheques came from
    Glen Grove Management Inc., which although a separate company, operated from
    the same premises as Glen Grove and later amalgamated with Glen Grove. The
    trial judge found that these cheques were related to the Settlement. This is
    contextual evidence that Edwin, on behalf of Glen Grove, assumed the agreement
    entered into on Glen Grove’s behalf by 129.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 18, 2003, Edwin, as counsel for Glen Grove, proposed that
    the Settlement include a mortgage on the Property, which was in Glen Grove’s
    power to grant. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Edwin, as counsel for Glen Grove, told Solmon that Glen Grove
    would guarantee the Settlement.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Solmon said he regarded Edwin’s instructions, on Glen Grove
    letterhead, to prepare the security documentation as part of his instructions.
    Solmon’s evidence was that he only ever acted for 129 and never acted for Glen
    Grove. Accepting Solmon’s evidence in that regard, the only basis on which
    Solmon could have accepted instructions from Edwin to prepare a mortgage on the
    Glen Grove property was if 129 was not just acting in its own right but also acting
    as agent for Glen Grove. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following Edwin’s instructions, Solmon prepared the relevant
    security documentation. On February 12, 2004, one of Solmon’s associates filed
    an internal memo including a draft mortgage on the Yonge Street Property, from
    Glen Grove to 119, as well as a guarantee by Glen Grove of 129’s obligations
    under the Settlement. There was discussion between Solmon and Tayar respecting
    the style of cause for the Consent to Judgment, which was part of the security.
    Accepting Solmon’s evidence that he only ever acted for 129 and not for Glen
    Grove, preparing the draft security documentation is contextual evidence that
    129 was acting as Glen Grove’s agent during the negotiations and in relation to
    offering 119 security and a guarantee. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of this evidence, the objective intention of the parties would have
    been that they intended 129 to act as agent for Glen Grove, and that Glen Grove
    authorized 129 to offer 119 security and a guarantee under the Settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Settlement must be interpreted in the light of this agency relationship, and in
    the light of 129’s authority to offer security and a guarantee on Glen Grove’s
    behalf. In <em>Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.</em>, 2014 SCC 53,
    [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, at para. 57, the Supreme Court recognized that in
    interpreting a written contract, regard must be had to the surrounding circumstances
    as well as to the text of the contract: “The goal of examining such evidence is
    to deepen a decision-maker's understanding of the mutual and objective
    intentions of the parties as expressed in the words of the contract.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant clause of the Settlement, insofar as Glen Grove is concerned, is para.
    3, which provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As security for payment, the purchaser [129] will provide: </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>a) if the owner of the Glengrove property is able to do so
    using reasonable efforts, and acting in good faith, a mortgage, to be
    registered against the Glengrove property… </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>b) a guarantee from the owner of the Glengrove property….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, the objective intention of 119 and 129, as Glen Grove’s
    agent, was that this clause of the Settlement bound Glen Grove to perform these
    obligations. 129 had authority to bind Glen Grove, and it is a reasonable
    inference that 119 believed 129 to be binding Glen Grove, given its
    longstanding insistence in backing the Settlement through security and a
    guarantee. The parties’ objective, mutual intention was that Glen Grove was
    bound by this agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Edwin controlled Glen Grove, he caused it, through 129, to enter into the
    Settlement. When Edwin died, Glen Grove’s position changed. It no longer
    considered itself bound. In my view, it was not entitled to resile from the
    Settlement. The fact that Sylvia was unhappy with the obligations her husband
    caused Glen Grove to incur is irrelevant. As the appellant itself notes, where
    parties have made an agreement that is subject to court approval, they do not
    have any power to resile from that agreement prior to the obtaining of court
    approval: <em>Wu Estate v. Zurich Insurance </em>Co. (2006), 211 O.A.C. 133 (C.A.),

  <p class=MsoHeading8>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can judgment be granted against Glen Grove, notwithstanding the default
    judgment entered against 129?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submitted, both at trial and on appeal, that if an agency
    relationship did exist, judgment could not be obtained against Glen Grove because
    119 had elected to obtain default judgment against 129. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree. In my view, neither election nor merger arise on the facts of this
    case. 119 is entitled to judgment against both 129 and Glen Grove.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Election
    and merger are separate, albeit related, concepts. Election refers to a
    decision to pursue either the agent or the principal for a single cause of
    action. Once a plaintiff has definitively elected to sue either principal or
    agent, he or she may not later choose to pursue the other party. Whether a
    party has elected is a question of fact, and is often difficult to prove.
    Merger, by contrast, occurs once judgment has been granted against either agent
    or principal. Once judgment is given against one, the cause of action against
    the other disappears, having “merged” in the judgment. The underlying rationale
    is again that there is only one cause of action. See Cameron Harvey and Darcy
    MacPherson, <em>Agency Law Primer</em>, 4th ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2009),
    at pp. 111-15; Peter Watts and F.M.B. Reynolds, <em>Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    when an agent contracts with a third party on behalf of a disclosed principal,
    the agent may bind itself personally as well as binding the principal. As
    Justice Brandon stated in <em>Bridges &amp; Salmon v. Owner of The Swan</em>,
    [1968] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 5 (U.K.H.C. Prob. Div.), at p. 12, the question of
    whether both agent and principal are liable on the contract depends on the
    objective intention of the contracting parties:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That intention is to be gathered from (1) the nature of the
    contract, (2) its terms and (3) the surrounding circumstances.… The intention
    for which the Court looks is not the subjective intention of [agent] or of [the
    third party]. Their subjective intentions may differ. The intention for which
    the Court looks is an objective intention of both parties, based on what two
    reasonable businessmen making a contract of that nature, in those terms and in
    those surrounding circumstances, must be taken to have intended.</p>

    granting the judgment now sought by the plaintiff against Glen Grove and

    the provisions of the Default Judgment as they would affect the interests of
    Glen Grove and Spendthrift were different in nature – i.e. the delivery of a
    mortgage against the Yonge St. Property and the delivery of a guarantee. The
    principle of election would not be engaged.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that separate remedies were being sought against 129 and Glen Grove is an
    important indication that 129 was acting for itself as well as acting as agent
    for Glen Grove. Other evidence that 129 also acted on its own behalf is the
    fact that 129 was to acquire ownership of the proof of claim and there was no
    evidence the parties intended this be transferred to Glen Grove, and that 129
    undertook to pay the $500,000 under the Settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, 129 and Glen Grove adopted distinct obligations under the Settlement.
    Both companies were liable to 119 but on different bases; 129 was liable to pay
    $500,000 and Glen Grove was liable to provide security and a guarantee. There
    was not a joint cause of action capable of merging in a judgment; rather, there
    were distinct obligations owed by 129 and Glen Grove. </p>

    assuming that there was one cause of action and that Glen Grove and 129 were
    jointly liable to 119 for the same obligations under the Settlement, the common
    law rule that judgment against one person jointly liable releases the other has
    been abrogated in Ontario by s. 139(1) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43: </p>

    first instance and the evidentiary record is sufficient to decide the issue:
    see <em>R. v. Perka</em>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, at p. 240. On appeal, it
    reasonably stems from the issues as framed by the parties: <em>R.&nbsp;v. Mian, </em>2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 30. On the record before us, it
    is not unfair to the parties to deal with the issue of agency and Glen Grove’s
    liability as principal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    agency was not pleaded in the statement of claim, the issue of whether 129 was
    an agent for Glen Grove was argued at trial. As I have said, the trial judge
    stated, at para. 122 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Defendants contended that there was no evidence tendered
    that 129 was acting as the agent for Glen Grove and Spendthrift. I accept that
    argument but it does not assist the Defendants. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    in the notice of appeal, the appellant relies on the trial judge’s holding, stating,
    “The learned trial judge correctly identified and found that 129 was not an
    agent for Glen Grove or Spendthrift.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its factum on appeal, the appellant made the following submissions, relevant to
    its position that no agency existed:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Solmon acted only for 129 and not for Glen Grove. Solmon
    specifically advised 119’s lawyer that he was only authorized to act for 129.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Plaintiff provided no evidence at trial as to why it took no
    steps to verify the terms of the Settlement with Sylvia (as the “owner of the
    Glengrove”), despite the fact that they were aware that any and all security
    for the Settlement would be coming from Glen Grove.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence, the terms of the Settlement, and the terms of the court
    order were clear that the agreement was between 119 and 129 only.  </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only connection between 129 on the one hand and Glen Grove
    and Spendthrift on the other hand was that Sylvia owned all of these companies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>119’s
    factum also makes a number of submissions relevant to the agency argument,
    including:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Initial offers to purchase Edwin’s debts came from Glen Grove.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Solmon testified that 119 was insistent that there would be no
    deal unless security was provided. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his capacity as corporate counsel to Glen Grove, Edwin wrote
    to Solmon confirming that Glen Grove agreed to the terms of settlement,
    including the mortgage and guarantee.  </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The $27,408.50 paid in keeping with the terms of the Settlement
    came from a cheque provided by Glen Grove Management. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Edwin gave instructions to enter into the settlement as the
    directing mind of Glen Grove and Spendthrift, as well as of 129.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in oral argument the appellant relied on the trial judge’s holding that an agency
    relationship did not exist. The appellant submitted that no agency relationship
    could be established because Solmon made representations to 119 that the
    companies were separately controlled and that he only represented 129. The appellant
    further submitted that if an agency relationship did exist, judgment could not
    be granted in favour of Glen Grove because default judgment had been obtained
    against 129.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    review of the record demonstrates that agency is neither a new issue raised on
    appeal, nor a new issue raised by this Court. It is therefore appropriate to dismiss
    the appeal on the basis that Glen Grove was liable under the Settlement, having
    been bound by its agent, 129.</p>
  <h5>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The appellant’s
    submissions respecting privity </h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    holding above is sufficient to dispose of this appeal. I do, however, wish to
    briefly comment on the appellant’s main submission. The appellant submitted
    that as Glen Grove was a separate corporate entity and it was not a party to the
    agreement between 119 and 129, Glen Grove could not be bound by the Settlement
    because 119 lacked privity of contract with Glen Grove. 119’s response, a
    response that the trial judge accepted, was akin to an estoppel argument based
    on the companies’ common principal that, for the reasons already given, I have
    rejected. 119 did not directly address the appellant’s argument that the
    doctrine of privity of contract ought to apply.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Privity
    of contract is a common law doctrine that “a contract cannot (as a general
    rule) confer rights or impose obligations under it on any person except the
    parties to it.” H.G. Beale, ed., <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, 31st ed., vol.
    1, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2012) at 18-003. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    injustice of a rigid application of the doctrine was the subject of comment in <em>Brown
    v. Belleville, (City)</em>, 2013 ONCA 148, 359 D.L.R. (4th) 658, at para. 79. Cronk
    J.A. on behalf of the court observed that the doctrine of privity of contract
    is subject to academic and judicial criticism, so much so that some
    Commonwealth jurisdictions have abrogated it while in other instances, “the reach
    of the doctrine has been significantly undermined by a growing list of
    exceptions to the rule&quot; (citations omitted).   <em> </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court recognized and elaborated a principled exception to the doctrine
    of privity of contract respecting third party beneficiaries in <em>Fraser River
    Pile &amp; Dredge Ltd. v. Can-Dive Services Ltd.</em>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 108, at
    para. 32. The Court held the rule could be relaxed with respect to a third
    party beneficiary where: 1) the parties to the initial agreement intended to
    extend a benefit to the third party; and 2) the activities of the third party
    were the very activities contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract
    or particular provision. John D. McCamus in <em>The Law of Contracts</em>, 2d
    ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2012), at p. 324, observes: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The purpose of the exception is to confer upon courts, in cases
    where the traditional exceptions of agency and trust do not apply, a discretion
    to undertake the appropriate analysis, bounded by both common sense and
    commercial reality, in order to determine whether the doctrine of privity with
    respect to third-party beneficiaries should be relaxed in given circumstances.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decisions
    imposing liability on a third party are fewer but they do exist. Examples are: <em>Seip
    &amp; Associates Inc. v. Emmanuel Village Management Inc.</em>, 2009 ONCA 222,
    247 O.A.C. 78; <em>Chan v. City Commercial Realty Group Ltd., </em>2011 ONSC

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Seip</em>, the defendant companies, Emmanuel Village Homes (EVH), Emmanuel
    Village Management (EVM) and Emmanuel Village Residence (EVR), were owned and
    operated by the same principal, Hunking. Seip entered into a contract with EVM
    to consult on the construction of a retirement residence complex and to manage
    the property for a five-year term when the first tenant moved in. The first
    page of the contract named EVM and EVH, but only EVM signed the agreement. EVR
    was not mentioned anywhere in the agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants
    EVM and EVH terminated the contract and Seip sued. The trial judge found that
    EVM and EVH were both parties to the contract despite it being executed only by
    EVM. The trial judge further found that while EVR was not initially a party to
    the agreement, it had bound itself to the contract, through its conduct. It
    purchased the complex with full knowledge of the parties’ agreement. Once EVR
    became the owner of the retirement complex, the work continued as if nothing
    had changed. EVR had the same principal as the parties to the contract, and Seip
    was paid by EVR. EVR took the benefit of Seip’s work. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant
    submitted that the trial judge effectively pierced the corporate veil and
    ignored the separate legal personality of each defendant. Gillese J.A.
    disagreed. She held, at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While the trial judge noted that EVR had the same principal as
    the other two corporate defendants, it does not necessarily follow that the
    trial judge pierced the corporate veil. In my view, the trial judge treated
    Hunking’s role in the three corporations as one piece of evidence on which to
    assess whether EVR had assumed the contract through its conduct and,
    consequently, was bound by it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gillese J.A.
    also considered article 11.2 of EVM’s contract with Seip, which permitted the
    sale of the project provided the new owner acknowledged in writing its
    willingness to assume Seip’s contract. Although EVR did not give such written
    acknowledgment, the role played by Hunking in the three corporate defendants,
    coupled with EVR’s conduct, was tantamount to such an acknowledgment. Gillese
    J.A. observed, at para. 38, that Hunking was the directing mind of all three
    corporate defendants; that Hunking was well aware that the clear intent of
    article 11.2 was to bind EVR, as purchaser; and that EVR by its conduct
    accepted the contract, and accepted the role as owner. She did not give effect
    to EVR’s submission that, as a third party, it had no obligation under the
    contract, concluding, “The conduct of all parties demonstrated a common
    intention that the Contract continued with EVR as an owner, in conjunction with
    the other corporate defendants.”    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>To summarize, in <em>Seip</em>, the privity of contract rule
    was relaxed and liability imposed where the following three factors were
    present: 1) the parties to the initial agreement intended to impose an
    obligation on the third party; 2) the activities of the third party, upon which
    basis the parties sought to impose liability, were within the scope envisaged
    under the agreement and 3) the third party had knowledge of the provision
    assigning it liability and, by its conduct, the third party assumed the
    agreement. The first two criteria mirror the requirements of <em>Fraser River,
    supra</em>. Arguably, all three criteria are present in this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the argument
    was not made that liability could be imposed based on a principled exception to
    the doctrine of privity of contract, nor was the decision in <em>Seip</em> the
    subject of submissions, it would not be fair to decide the case on a point
    counsel did not have the opportunity to address. Consequently, the doctrinal
    basis for a principled exception to the doctrine of privity of contract when
    liability is sought to be imposed on a third party will have to await argument
    another day. </p>
  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>If Glen Grove is
    liable, is its liability limited to $450,000 as opposed to $500,000? </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the
    letters incorporated into the Settlement (the letter of August 28, 2003)
    amended the $500,000 obligation to $450,000. This lower amount was confirmed in
    the final letter of October 3, 2003. The trial judge, however, found liability
    remained at $500,000 and the appellant submits he therefore erred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The August 28,
    2003, letter did propose to reduce the mortgage amount to $450,000, but only if
    $50,000 was paid to the Receiver within 30 days of court approval. The $50,000
    was not paid and because the property has been sold, the mortgage issue is
    largely moot. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that
    nowhere was it suggested that the consent to judgment or guarantee were to be

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    found that both Glen Grove and Spendthrift were liable under the Settlement. The
    evidence shows that Glen Grove was liable on the basis of agency. Having
    rejected the trial judge’s application of the “privity principle”, there is
    insufficient evidence before the court to determine that Spendthrift is also
    liable.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111] 129 contracted in its own right with 119 and, in
    addition, contracted as agent for Glen Grove. In these circumstances, the doctrines
    of election and merger do not apply; both 129 and Glen Grove are liable on the
    contract. [112] There was insufficient evidence to find that Spendthrift was
    bound by the Settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113] I would dismiss the appeal as it relates to Glen
    Grove. I would allow the appeal as it relates to Spendthrift. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span

    colleague that the trial judge erred in relying on privity, as he approached
    it, to conclude that Glen Grove should be held responsible for 119's obligations
    under the Settlement. I also agree with my colleague that the result -
    dismissing the appeal - can be sustained, on agency.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span

    not want to be taken to agree with my colleague’s suggestion that the third

    available basis upon which to find Glen Grove responsible under the Settlement.
    In addition to the fact that this exception to the doctrine of privity of
    contract was not advanced on appeal (as my colleague noted), or pleaded or
    argued at trial, I note that third party liability is a relatively uncharted
    doctrinal area and in all of the circumstances, I cannot say that it may apply
