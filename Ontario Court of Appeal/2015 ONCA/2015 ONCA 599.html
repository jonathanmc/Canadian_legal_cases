  <p class=Heard>Heard: August 25, 2015</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on April 10, 2013,
    and the sentence imposed on September 20, 2013 by Justice Anne Mullins of the Superior
    Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Pardu J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from convictions on two counts of invitation to sexual
    touching of a child. The jury acquitted the appellant of sexual assault. The
    appellant argues that on the facts of this case these verdicts are necessarily
    inconsistent, and submits that the convictions on the charges of invitation to
    sexual touching must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that when she was 13 years old the appellant
    began making her masturbate him and perform oral sex on him, that he tried to digitally
    penetrate her, and forced himself on top of her. The complainant said that the
    appellant would tell her to put her hand or her mouth on his penis, or kiss it.
    She said the sexual contact occurred 38 or 39 times. The appellant denied
    participating in any sexual communication or contact.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge correctly instructed the jury as to the elements of the
    offences. She instructed the jury that each of the following had to be
    established beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span class=Underline>Count 1: Invitation to Sexual
    Touching</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant invited the complainant to touch his penis with her mouth.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This touching was for a sexual purpose.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span class=Underline>Count 2: Initiation to Sexual
    Touching</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant invited the complainant to touch his penis with her hand</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This touching was for a sexual purpose.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span class=Underline>Count 3: Sexual Assault</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant intentionally touched the complainant with his fingers or
    penis</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That touching took place in circumstances of a sexual nature.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of sentencing, the trial judge interpreted the jurys
    verdict as a finding that the invitations to touching for a sexual purpose were
    made by the appellant, but that actual physical contact did not occur. Consent
    was no defence in this case because of the complainants age. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the complainant did perform oral sex or masturbate the appellant, it
    is common ground on appeal that his participation in these events would have
    amounted to a sexual assault by him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that there was no suggestion on the evidence that
    the complainant did not comply with the invitations to sexual touching uttered
    by the appellant. Therefore, the appellant submits, the acquittal on the sexual
    assault count cannot be reconciled with the convictions on the invitation to
    sexual touching counts. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Legal Test</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard of review applied to jury verdicts is whether the verdict
    could reasonably have been rendered by a properly instructed jury acting
    judicially: [I]n deciding whether the verdict is one which a properly
    instructed jury could reasonably have rendered, the reviewing court must ask
    not only whether there is evidence in the record to support the verdict, but
    also whether the jurys conclusion conflicts with the bulk of judicial
    experience (<em>R. v. W.H.</em>, 2013 SCC 22, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 180, at para.
    28).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test to be applied by a reviewing court to determine whether jury
    verdicts are inconsistent is whether the verdicts are supportable on any
    theory of the evidence consistent with the legal instructions given by the
    trial judge (<em>R. v. Pittiman</em>, 2006 SCC 9, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 381, at
    para. 7). On a multi-count indictment against a single accused, the verdicts
    will be supportable if the trial judges instructions were proper legal instructions
    that could have led the jury to accept a theory of the evidence producing these
    verdicts (<em>R. v. S.L.</em>, 2013 ONCA 176, 300 C.C.C. (3d) 100, at para.
    5). As indicated in <em>Pittiman</em>, at para. 6, the authority to set aside a
    verdict on the ground of inconsistency is based on the jurisdiction accorded by
    s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to set aside a verdict on the
    ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. The
    court noted, at paras. 6-7:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Hence, before an appellate court may interfere
    with a verdict on the ground that it is inconsistent, the court must find that
    the verdict is </span><em>unreasonable</em><span lang=EN>. The appellant bears
    the onus to show that no reasonable jury whose members had applied their minds
    to the evidence could have arrived at that conclusion: </span><em>R. v.
    McLaughlin</em><span lang=EN> (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 562 (Ont. C.A.). </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The onus of establishing that a verdict is
    unreasonable on the basis of inconsistency with other verdicts is a difficult
    one to meet because the jury, as the sole judge of the facts, has a very wide
    latitude in its assessment of the evidence. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no necessary logical inconsistency between the conviction on
    the invitation to sexual touching counts and the acquittal on the sexual
    assault count. The jury could have accepted some, none or all of the
    complainants evidence. If the jury concluded that the invitations had been
    extended for a sexual purpose but that no contact actually occurred, these
    verdicts would have resulted. These verdicts can be reconciled on a rational
    and logical basis, however, looking at the record through the lens of judicial
    experience, it seems unlikely that the jury would have taken that view of the
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is more likely that the jury did not understand that participation by the
    appellant in physical contact of a sexual nature between the complainant and
    the appellant amounted to an assault, even if it resulted from the complainant
    complying with the appellants invitation. They may not have understood that the
    requirement that the Crown prove that he intentionally touched the
    complainant with his penis included this kind of physical contact. This
    misunderstanding, coupled with a doubt on whether the appellant digitally
    penetrated the complainant as she alleged, could have resulted in the acquittal
    on the sexual assault charge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accurately summarized the evidence, and her instructions on the law
    were correct, so far as they went. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel did not object to any aspect of the jury charge now challenged on
    appeal. Had the trial judge expressly told the jury that compliance with the
    invitation to sexual touching amounted to a sexual assault by the appellant,
    this would have likely enlarged the instances of conduct potentially forming
    the basis for conviction on the sexual assault count. If the trial judge erred
    in failing to do so, this error enured to the benefit of the appellant. It does
    nothing to undermine the convictions for invitation to sexual touching. These
    convictions were reasonable and were amply supported by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no reason to believe that the verdicts were the product of any unjustifiable
    compromise. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
