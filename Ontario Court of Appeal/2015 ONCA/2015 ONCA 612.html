  <p class=Heading><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>By the
    Court:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 28, 2013, following a trial that began in August 2012 – and
    based on a protection application filed in early September 2010 – the appellants’
    two children were found in need of protection. In all the circumstances, the trial
    judge ordered that the children be designated Crown wards without access. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 25, 2015, a Superior Court appeal judge dismissed the
    appellants’ appeal from that order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this court, the appellants ask that the Crown wardship order
    be varied to provide them with access to their children.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iSSUES AND dISCUSSION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise three issues on appeal. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'>ISSUE 1: Did
    the trial judge err in determining the Indian or native status of the children?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellants argue that the trial judge erred in law in failing
    to identify the appellant mother as Indian or native. They submit that identifying
    her as such would have triggered certain special provisions of the <em>Child
    and Family Services Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (the “CFSA”) relating to
    Indian and native children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, the appellants argue that the trial judge erred in
    failing to apply the principles from <em>R. v. Gladue</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688,<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='vertical-align:baseline'> </span></span>to
    the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these arguments. As a starting point, the appellants
    did not raise these issues at trial. In any event, neither the mother nor the
    children fall within the definition of Indian or native person under the CFSA. Further,
    in the face of the statutory definitions, <em>Gladue</em> principles do not
    assist in determining whether the children are Indian or native persons. Finally,
    we are not persuaded that <em>Gladue</em> principles affect the determination
    of whether an access order would be appropriate in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 47(2)(c) of the CFSA, the court hearing a protection
    application is required to determine “[a]s soon as practicable, and in any
    event before determining whether a child is in need of protection … whether the
    child is an Indian or a native person and, if so, the child’s band or native
    community”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Indian” and “native person” are defined terms in the CFSA. Section 3
    provides that “‘Indian’ has the same meaning as in the <em>Indian Act</em> (Canada)” and that “‘native person’ means a person who is a member of a native
    community but is not a member of a band, and ‘native child’ has a corresponding
    meaning”. Section 209 of the CFSA permits the Minister to “designate a
    community, with the consent of its representatives, as a native community for
    the purposes of this Act.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    represented by counsel, at trial the appellants did not advance any argument
    that either the mother or the children fell within the definition of Indian or
    native person under the CFSA. Instead, in response to the required inquiry from
    the trial judge, the appellants’ counsel confirmed that the information in the
    Society’s application concerning status was correct. In relation to both
    children, the Society’s application stated “no Indian status”.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    while the mother testified at trial that she is part native, she provided no
    additional evidence about her aboriginal heritage or about any connection with
    a native community.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the trial judge made no error in failing to identify the
    mother or children as Indian or as native persons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to the Superior Court, the appellant mother filed an affidavit indicating
    that her father is Ojibway. She does not claim to be a status Indian within the
    meaning of the <em>Indian Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. Rather, she argues
    that the definition of Indian under the <em>Indian Act</em> has been extended
    by case law and that <em>Gladue </em>extends the meaning of native to include
    persons self-identifying as native.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  However,
    contrary to the appellants’ submissions, <em>Daniels v. Canada (Minister of Indian
    Affairs and Northern Development)</em>, 2014 FCA 101, 371 D.L.R. (4th) 725,
    does not stand for the proposition that non-status Indians are included as
    “Indians” within the meaning of s. 91(24) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.
    Moreover, <em>Gladue</em> was decided under the <em>Criminal Code</em> and does
    not alter the statutory definitions set out in the CFSA. In any event, we note
    that the relevant inquiry under the CFSA is the children’s status, not the
    mother’s status. The fact that the mother may self-identify as native does not
    determine her children’s status. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    s. 59 (2.1) of the CFSA provides that “[a] court shall not make … an access
    order … with respect to a Crown ward unless the court is satisfied that, (a)
    the relationship between the person and the child is beneficial and meaningful
    to the child; and (b) the ordered access will not impair the child’s future
    opportunities for adoption.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time the trial judge’s decision was delivered, the children had been in
    care for about three years and three months. When apprehended, the youngest
    child was less than two years old. The trial judge declined to make an order
    for access for two reasons. First, she was not satisfied that a relationship
    existed between the appellants and their children that was beneficial or
    meaningful to the children. Second, because no adoption plan had by then been
    put forward, she was unable to determine whether access would impair the
    children’s future opportunities for adoption.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    of the date of the appeal to the Superior Court, the children had not had
    access with the appellants for more than a year and there was evidence that
    neither child had asked for contact with the appellants since the last visit.
    Moreover, following an inquiry directed by the court, the proposed adoptive
    parents (the children’s foster parents since being taken into care) wrote a
    letter to the Society’s counsel indicating they were unwilling to meet with
    counsel or the appellants and that “any court ordered openness or access would
    jeopardize the stability of the placement.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    these circumstances, an access order was not available under the CFSA – and <em>Gladue</em> principles did not in any way assist in making that determination. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'>ISSUE 2:  Did
    the trial judge err by drawing negative inferences based on the appellant
    mother’s “flat affect”?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue raised by the appellants on appeal is that the trial judge erred
    in failing to recognize the mother’s “flat affect” as an immutable feature of
    the mother’s cultural identity as an Ojibway. The appellants argue that the
    trial judge erred in drawing negative inferences about the mother and her
    ability to connect with her children based on an undiagnosed “flat affect” and
    monotone voice, both of which the appellants claim are immutable features of
    the mother’s cultural identity that do not affect her parenting abilities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this argument. This issue was fully canvassed before the Superior
    Court appeal judge. The Superior Court appeal judge placed little weight on
    fresh evidence the appellants sought to introduce on appeal from “a
    self-described expert on many, if not all aboriginal issues” concerning flat
    affect as it pertains to aboriginal peoples. He did so in part because no
    effort had been made to adduce such evidence at trial, or to demonstrate on
    appeal the witness’s credentials. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Superior Court appeal judge noted that the issue of the mother’s flat affect
    and her ability to connect with her children had been raised in a Parental
    Capacity Assessment prior to trial. Despite that, the only evidence the
    appellants led at trial in response was a brief statement by the mother that
    she is part native and that natives tend to speak in a monotone voice. As noted
    by the Superior Court appeal judge, this evidence was insufficient to allay the
    trial judge’s concerns arising from the assessor’s evidence that the mother was
    unable to connect emotionally with her children and gain their attention. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    while the issue of the mother’s flat affect was mentioned in the Parental
    Capacity Assessment, many other concerns were also raised. In his reasons
    dismissing the parents’ appeal, the Superior Court appeal judge fully addressed
    the issue of whether the trial judge failed to consider the best interests of
    the children in making an order for Crown wardship.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis on which to interfere with the Superior Court appeal judge’s
    conclusions.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'>Issue 3:  Did
    the trial judge err in failing to consider the best interests of the children
    in relation to access?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final issue raised by the appellants is that the trial judge erred in failing
    to consider the best interests of the children in relation to access. The
    appellants argue that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the best
    interests of the children in the context of their aboriginal heritage and in
    failing to consider that ongoing contact with their birth parents would assist
    in preserving their sense of historical and cultural uniqueness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. The trial judge was aware of the children’s cultural heritage.
    She noted in her reasons that “[w]hile the children are not ‘Indian or native’
    as defined by the CFSA, they do have a link to that heritage through their
    mother. Family connections are an important consideration in assessing the best
    interests of the children.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    that observation, the trial judge concluded that, considering all the
    circumstances of the case, an order for Crown wardship was necessary and in the
    best interests of the children. That finding is supported by the evidence and
    the appellants have not sought to set aside the order for Crown wardship on
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have said, once the trial judge determined that an order for Crown wardship
    was necessary, in the face of s. 59 (2.1) of the CFSA and in the light of her
    other findings, an access order was not available. On appeal to the Superior
    Court, the trial judge’s findings and conclusions were upheld – and
    supplemented. As we have said, the Superior Court appeal judge directed that an
    inquiry be made concerning whether the proposed adoptive parents (the
    children’s foster parents since apprehension) would proceed with the adoption
    if an order were made for Crown wardship with access. The proposed adoptive
    parents responded in a letter to the Society’s counsel that “any court ordered
    openness or access would jeopardize the stability of the placement.” Further,
    the Superior Court appeal judge stated that the court had been advised that the
    proposed adoptive parents were not prepared to proceed with the adoption on
    that basis. He concluded that making an order for Crown wardship would impair
    the children’s prospects for adoption. We see no basis on which to interfere
    with his determination or that of the trial judge. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delay</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    disposing of this appeal, like the Superior Court appeal judge, we must comment
    on the issue of delay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the Superior Court appeal judge set out a brief chronology of the
    salient events in this case. We have included that chronology in Appendix ‘A’. In
    short, the children went into care with their current foster parents more than five
    years ago on September 2, 2010. They were then 1.8 and 3.8 years old.  They are
    now six and eight and are still in legal limbo. Such delay is unacceptable in
    the lives of these children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    setting out his chronology, the Superior Court appeal judge noted that none of
    the legislated time limits under the CFSA “were even remotely adhered to” in
    this case. He expressed concern about the failure to follow the statutory
    requirements as well as the overall delay. He also expressed the hope that
    counsel would bring his concerns to the attention of those who can affect
    meaningful change.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    echo the Superior Court appeal judge’s concerns. We go further and state that
    it is imperative that judges, court administrators, counsel (particularly
    counsel for Children’s Aid Societies) and assessors take responsibility for
    ensuring adherence to statutorily required timelines. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    summarize below the most significant delays that occurred in this case:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More than a year passed from the date of apprehension on
    September 2, 2010 until the date when the Parental Capacity Assessment was
    completed on October 27, 2011.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Society amended its protection application to instead request
    Crown Wardship on February 3, 2012. This was almost a year-and-a-half after the
    date of apprehension and already past the 12-month statutory limit for Society
    custody and care. More than six months passed between this date and the first hearing
    date at the Ontario Court of Justice on August 23, 2012.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Almost six months passed between the first and last days of the
    Crown wardship hearing at the Ontario Court of Justice (from August 23, 2012 until
    February 4, 2013) with no more than a few days of hearings each month.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More than nine months passed from the conclusion of the hearing
    to the release of the Ontario Court of Justice Reasons.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More than a year passed from the filing of the Notice of Appeal
    with the Superior Court of Justice on December 16, 2013 to the first Superior
    Court of Justice hearing date on February 12, 2015.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    a statute requires that events occur within a specified time frame, it is
    simply unacceptable that justice system participants fail to adhere to those
    time frames. As Justice L’Heureux-Dubé commented on behalf of the majority of
    the Supreme Court in <em>Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. K.L.W.</em>,
    2000 SCC 48, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 519, at para. 136, “[t]he six-month delay prior to
    the hearing to determine whether John was in need of protection appears, on its
    face, to be highly unreasonable, particularly in the case of a newborn child.”
    This court spoke about  the importance of timeliness in child welfare cases in <em>Children’s
    Aid Society of Oxford County v. W.T.C.</em>, 2013 ONCA 491, [2013] O.J. No.
    3438. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    requires, among other things, that assessment reports be prepared with
    dispatch; that Children’s Aid Societies make decisions in accordance with statutory
    timelines about how to proceed in a particular case; that meaningful case
    management occur in which timetables are set and witness lists are fully
    canvassed; that trials be scheduled so that trial days are not stretched over
    months; and that trial judges receive adequate time to prepare reasons in a
    timely fashion.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    acknowledge that additional factors may contribute to delay in particular cases.
    It is our hope, however, that all those involved in the child welfare system
    will do their part to minimize delay and promote finality for children. The
    children involved in this system deserve better.</p>
