  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice J.W. Bovard
    of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated November 27, 2014.</p>
  <p class=Endorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Following his plea of guilty, the respondent was sentenced to five
    years imprisonment for having committed a number of sexual offences against his
    14-year-old daughter: sexual touching (1 count); invitation to his daughter to
    touch his body with her mouth for a sexual purpose (2 counts); and sexual
    intercourse (1 count).  The offences took place between June 18, 2013 and July
    30, 2013. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal, and, if leave is granted, requests that
    a sentence of at least 8 years be imposed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing proceeded by way of an agreed statement of facts from
    which we have extracted the following summary. After being unknown to his
    daughter, the respondent had contact with her in April 2013 for approximately a
    week when she and her mother visited him. At the end of the school year, the mother,
    who was having difficulty with her daughter, reached out to the respondent,
    hoping that a relationship with him would help the daughter improve her
    lifestyle choices. The daughter left her home in the United States to live with
    the respondent for the summer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within days, the respondent initiated sexual activity with his daughter.
    He told her to think of him as her boyfriend, and not her father. Over the next
    approximately six-week period, the respondent had intercourse with his daughter
    nearly daily. He also had his daughter perform oral sex on him twice and once
    took pictures of her while making her pose naked. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the end of this period, the respondent, an alcoholic, took his
    daughter to meet her older, half-sister.  Everyone was drinking. The younger
    daughter drank too – to the point of vomiting. The respondent and his younger
    daughter stayed overnight, sleeping on the living room couch. During the night,
    the older daughter went into the living room to check on her younger
    half-sister. She saw her father performing oral sex on her half-sister and
    digitally penetrating her. She contacted the police, who arrested the
    respondent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the sentencing judge erred in principle by
    misidentifying the range of appropriate sentences for the sexual offences
    committed by the respondent and, as a result, imposed a sentence that was
    manifestly unfit. In particular, the Crown argues that the sentencing judge found
    that he was bound by the sentencing range of three to five years identified in <em>R.
    v. B.(J.)</em> (1990), 36 O.A.C. 307 (C.A.) and that he erred in doing so. The
    Crown submits that the correct range was identified by this court in <em>R. v.
    D.(D.)</em> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788 (C.A.). In that case, Moldaver J.A. held
    that adult offenders, in a position of trust, who sexually abuse innocent young
    children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial periods of time can
    expect to receive mid to upper single digit penitentiary terms.  The Crown
    relied on both decisions in its sentencing submissions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Crown submits that the sentencing judge failed to give
    sufficient consideration to the fact that the respondent was a repeat offender.
    He had two prior convictions for sexual offences against children: one in 1987
    for sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl he was babysitting, on two occasions,
    and one in 1988, again for sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl he was
    babysitting. In both cases, the respondent touched the victim's vagina.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded that the sentencing judge felt bound to impose a
    sentence that did not exceed five years. Thus, in our opinion he did not err in
    principle. He thanked counsel for the authorities they submitted because it
    gave him a &quot;good idea of the range of sentences that the courts consider
    in cases such as this one.&quot; The sentencing judge described <em>B.(J.)</em> as &quot;the most helpful case&quot;. In <em>B.(J.)</em>, the court noted that
    a number of factors will determine the appropriate length of sentence within
    the range for a sexual assault. These include the age of the victim, the
    duration and frequency of the sexual assaults, the criminal record of the
    offender, the effects on the victim and the presence or absence of collateral violence
    or remorse. The court also noted that the ordinary range will be exceeded when
    the circumstances cry out for a more severe penalty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the sentencing judge did not specifically advert to <em>D.(D.)</em> in his reasons, he imposed a sentence at the bottom of the range identified in
    that case. In <em>D.(D.)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, a</span></em>t
    para. 44, Moldaver J.A. (as he then was) wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[W]hen adult offenders, in a position of trust, sexually abuse
    innocent young children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial
    periods of time, they can expect to receive mid to upper single digit
    penitentiary terms. When the abuse involves full intercourse, anal or vaginal,
    and it is accompanied by other acts of physical violence, threats of physical
    violence, or other forms of extortion, upper single digit to low double digit
    penitentiary terms will generally be appropriate. Finally, in cases where these
    elements are accompanied by a pattern of severe psychological, emotional and
    physical brutalization, still higher penalties will be warranted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  A
    brief outline of the facts in these two cases is of assistance in appreciating how
    they compare with the instant case. In <em>B.(J.)</em>, the accused commenced
    having sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter when she was only six years
    old. The abuse continued weekly, and sometimes more frequently, until she was
    fourteen. The victim was threatened with punishment if she did not comply and
    there was an instance of violence, apart from the sexual assaults. The
    accused's criminal record included a charge of attempted rape of an eight-year-old
    girlfriend of the victim. The accused's sexual abuse of his stepdaughter persisted
    after he had served his sentence for attempted rape. Because of this, the
    appellant’s counsel conceded that a sentence beyond the usual five-year range
    was required. The court upheld the sentence of eight years imposed by the sentencing
    judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>D.(D.)</em>, the accused coerced four boys – ranging in age from 5 to 8
    years – to engage in all manner of sexual activity for periods of time ranging
    from two to seven years. The accused stood in a position of trust towards the
    boys. He employed violence, threats of violence and extortion. In one instance,
    he held a boy over his thirtieth-floor balcony and warned him that he would be
    thrown off if he complained to anyone. The court upheld a sentence of nine
    years and one month.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the appellant’s conduct was insidious. He abused his teenage
    daughter who had come to him for help. The acts also included full sexual
    intercourse, nearly daily. His final assault on his daughter in the home of his
    older daughter, after permitting her to consume alcohol to the point where she vomited,
    is particularly disturbing. Further, the abuse stopped only because his older
    daughter caught him. That said, without minimizing the appellant's conduct
    towards his troubled and vulnerable daughter, in the context of cases involving
    sexual abuse perpetrated by persons in a position of trust, these offences
    occurred over a relatively compact period of time. The undeniably major breach
    of trust is attenuated to some extent, relative to other cases of sexual abuse
    by a parent, by the fact that the respondent really had no prior relationship
    with his 14-year-old daughter before she came to live with him. The respondent
    did not employ physical violence, threats of violence or extortion. He pled guilty
    and expressed remorse and a desire for treatment. The sentencing judge was
    alive to these circumstances, as well as the fact that the respondent’s related
    criminal record was very dated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. P.M.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2012 ONCA
    162, 282 C.C.C. (3d) 450, Rosenberg J.A., writing for the majority, after a
    thorough analysis of the case law, recognized the upward trend in the
    sentencing of sexual offenders in a position of parental trust and adopted and
    reasserted the principles set out in <em>D.(D</em><i>.)</i>. He explained that <em>B.(J.)</em> must now be read with <em>D.(D.)</em>. At para. 46, he wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he court signalled in <em>D.(D.)</em> that the sexual abuse
    of a child will attract lengthy penitentiary sentences. In my view, where a
    father has committed repeated acts of incest with his daughter over many
    months, as in this case, it will be highly unusual for the court to impose a
    penitentiary sentence of less than five to six years. Such a range is more
    consistent with this court's decision in <em>D.(D.)</em> and is also more
    consistent with amendments to the <em>Criminal Code</em> since <em>B.(J.)</em> was decided.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    in our view, the sentence imposed was at the bottom of the range, we are not
    persuaded that the individual circumstances of the case render it manifestly
