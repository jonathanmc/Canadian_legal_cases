  <h1><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Underline>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Jomo Blake, was convicted of one count of sexual
    interference relating to a 15-year old complainant following a jury trial
    presided over by Di Tomaso J. of the Superior Court of Justice. During the
    trial, the trial judge made a ruling relating to the voluntariness of the
    appellant’s statements to police and the sufficiency of police compliance with
    their obligation to inform the appellant of his right to counsel. The appellant
    appealed this ruling. At the conclusion of the hearing, the panel indicated
    that the appeal would be dismissed, with reasons to follow. These are the
    reasons.</p>
  <h1><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Underline>Facts</span></h1>
  <h3><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></span><span
class=Underline>The parties and events</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant reported that she had been sexually assaulted by the
    appellant, a family friend. She said that the appellant began touching her
    sexually when she was 13 or 14 years old. Sometimes she would babysit at the
    appellant’s home; on a few occasions she slept over. The complainant told the
    police that she and the appellant had sexual intercourse during these overnight
    visits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after the complainant made her statement to the police, the
    police arrested the appellant at his workplace. When he was arrested, the
    appellant said “I know what this is about”. He stated that he understood his
    right to counsel and said that he wanted to contact his wife so that she could
    call a lawyer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the car ride to the police station, the appellant asked again to
    speak to his wife to arrange for a lawyer. Detective Constable Jason Stamp
    testified that his partner Detective Kevin McLean asked if the appellant or his
    wife had a lawyer. When the appellant said “No”, Detective McLean told the
    appellant that he could contact duty counsel at the police station.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective McLean did not recall that conversation but said that the
    appellant made a spontaneous statement in which he said: “I heard I’m not the
    first one. I heard her father did it to her.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective McLean stated that, once they arrived at the station, the
    appellant wanted to consult with duty counsel. The booking officer noted that
    the appellant “wished to speak to duty counsel.” The appellant arrived at the
    station at 1:25 p.m. and was placed in a cell. At 2:35 p.m., he was taken to a
    private area to speak, by telephone, to duty counsel. The conversation lasted
    until 2:47 p.m.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the appellant’s police interview began, the appellant’s wife
    arrived at the police station’s front desk. The appellant was told that she had
    arrived and he asked Detective McLean to ask his wife to contact a lawyer.
    Detective McLean testified that he relayed this request and, when the wife said
    that she didn’t know any lawyers, he told her that duty counsel was available.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was interviewed by Detective McLean from 4:31 p.m. to 6:17
    p.m. The appellant agreed that he had been given an opportunity to speak to
    duty counsel. He said that he knew of the allegation against him and denied
    ever touching the complainant sexually.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 5:06 p.m., the appellant again asked to call his wife to get a
    lawyer. Detective McLean said that the appellant could call a lawyer again if
    he wanted to, but also told the appellant that new information had come to
    light (from the complainant’s family) regarding assaults on the appellant’s children.
    This line of questioning lasted for about five minutes, at which point
    Detective McLean said that the Children’s Aid Society would be investigating
    the allegations the next day.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    McLean then suggested to the appellant that this sexual contact with the
    complainant had been consensual. He stated: “if you had consent, then you had
    consent and I’m going home.” At the <em>voir dire</em>, Detective McLean
    acknowledged that this statement was not true. After this line of questioning,
    and as Detective McLean was ending the interview, the appellant said that he
    wanted to go home to his wife and children and confessed to having sexual
    intercourse with the complainant on one occasion:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>DCM: Would that … did you have consensual sex?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>JB:     Yes we have consensual sex.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>DCM: On Saturday night.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>JB:     Yes. </p>
  <h3><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(2)<span

class=Underline>The trial judge’s ruling</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the trial, a blended <em>voir dire</em> was held to consider whether the
    appellant’s statements to the police were voluntary and whether his rights
    pursuant to ss. 7, 10(a) and 10(b) of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> were violated. The trial judge ruled that the appellant’s statement was
    voluntary and that he had not been deprived of his right to counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals these rulings.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues on the appeal:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Did the trial judge err by
    concluding that the appellant was not denied his right to counsel of choice
    under s. 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em>?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Did the trial judge err by
    concluding that the appellant’s s. 10(b) right to counsel was not violated when
    Detective McLean introduced allegations of potential child abuse into the
    interview with the appellant?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Did the trial judge err by finding
    that the confession was voluntary? </p>
  <h1><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>D.<span

  <h2><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></span><span
class=Underline>Right to counsel</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    purpose of the right to counsel is to provide the accused with legal advice and
    to ensure that the accused understands his or her right to silence: see <em>R.
    v. Sinclair</em>, 2010 SCC 35, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 310, at paras. 24-26; <em>R. v.
    Willier</em>, 2010 SCC 37, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 429, at para. 38. Police have a duty
    to facilitate access to a lawyer immediately and that includes the right to
    contact counsel of choice as well as the right to contact a third party to
    facilitate access to counsel: see <em>R. v. Taylor</em>, 2014 SCC 50, [2014] 2
    S.C.R. 495, at para. 24; <em>R. v. K.W.J.</em>, 2012 NWTCA 3, at paras. 32-33.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the police officers did not facilitate his wish to
    contact his wife so that she could obtain a lawyer for him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission. This issue was not raised at trial. The trial
    judge found as fact that the appellant wished to speak to duty counsel and did
    so before his interview with the police. The appellant made no complaint about
    the advice he received and he clearly understood his right to silence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, it was appropriate for Detective McLean to ask the appellant if he
    or his wife had a lawyer; this would be required information if the officer was
    going to assist the appellant in contacting a specific lawyer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I do not think that Detective McLean attempted to deflect the appellant’s
    attention away from the retention of a private lawyer and towards consultation
    with duty counsel. He was simply trying to obtain sufficient information to be
    able to comply with his constitutional obligation to assist the appellant in
    his desire to obtain legal advice. The detective’s references to the duty
    counsel option were consistent with this goal: see <em>R. v. McCrimmon</em>,
    2010 SCC 36, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 402, at para. 19.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that a second s. 10 (b) <i>Charter</i> breach occurred when
    the appellant was not afforded an opportunity to re-consult with counsel after
    Detective McLean informed him that there might be an allegation that he had
    abused his own children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> affords an accused a single consultation with
    counsel. However, in some instances, a further opportunity to consult with
    counsel may be required where a change in circumstances necessitates a second
    consultation to fulfil the purposes of s. 10(b). One of the main instances in
    which an opportunity of a second consultation is required is where the accused
    faces a change in jeopardy. As explained by McLachlin C.J. and Charron J. in <em>Sinclair</em>,
    at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The detainee is advised upon detention of the reasons for the
    detention: s. 10(a). The s. 10(b) advice and opportunity to consult counsel
    follows this. The advice given will be tailored to the situation as the
    detainee and his lawyer then understand it.  If the investigation takes a new
    and more serious turn as events unfold, that advice may no longer be adequate
    to the actual situation, or jeopardy, the detainee faces. In order to fulfill
    the purpose of s. 10(b), the detainee must be given a further opportunity to
    consult with counsel and obtain advice on the new situation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the conversation between the appellant and Detective McLean during the
    interview did not rise to a level that required a second s. 10(b) offer to the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    leading case on the duty of police to re-advise detainees of their rights
    during an interview/statement scenario is this court’s decision in <em>R. v.
    Sawatsky</em> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 767. In that case, this court held that the
    police must reiterate the right to counsel if they ask questions that go beyond
    an exploratory stage in connection with a related but significantly more
    serious offence or a different or unrelated offence. See also <em>R. v. D.T.</em>,
    2013 ONCA 166, 305 O.A.C. 58, at para. 28.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    McLean’s conduct in his interview with the appellant does not come close to
    crossing the line drawn in <em>Sawatsky</em> and <em>D.T.</em> On this point, I
    explicitly endorse the trial judge’s reasoning in his <em>voir dire</em> ruling:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>During Mr. Blake’s interview, Detective McLean raised the issue
    of a separate investigation that police and the Children’s Aid Society were
    going to be jointly looking into regarding Mr. Blake’s children. On behalf of
    Mr. Blake it is submitted that he was effectively “threatened” with other
    charges in relation to the abuse of his child or children for which he faced
    new jeopardy and regarding which he should have been advised of his rights once
    more to speak to counsel. I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I do not accept that there is an evidentiary foundation upon
    which to find that this reference to a separate investigation involving the
    Children’s Aid Society and Mr. Blake’s children was in any way a threat in
    relation to the allegations currently before the court. Detective McLean did
    not in any way threaten Mr. Blake with separate charges if he did not confess
    to the allegations before the court. Mr. Blake was never told that he would be
    facing any further charges. Quite to the contrary, at that point in time, the
    investigation had not even commenced.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I do not accept that Mr. Blake faced an inquiry or elevated
    jeopardy in respect of the Children’s Aid Society investigation which could
    cause him to feel threatened in respect of very different charges before this
    court. There was no “<em>quid pro quo</em>” on the evidentiary record before
    this court that would in any way suggest that if Mr. Blake did not confess to
    the offences for which he had been charged involving [the complainant], then,
    he would face an entirely new and separate set of charges involving the abuse
    of his children.</p>
  <h2><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(3)<span

class=Underline>Voluntariness</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that by raising child abuse allegations, Detective McLean created an atmosphere of oppression.  The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the appellant's confession was unreliable because it flowed from Detective McLean's disingenuous description of the legal consequences of consensual sex with a minor. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept that raising a child abuse allegation created an atmosphere of
    oppression. That line of questioning lasted for less than five minutes. It did
    not create oppressive conditions or cause him to confess. His will was not
    overborne. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that Detective McLean introduced, and even pressed, the issue of
    consensual sex during his interview with the appellant:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>DCM: So that’s what I’m talking about, consent, you understand
    all that. And … that explains a lot to me if that is the case….</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>DCM: I’m saying if you … had consent then you had consent and
    I’m going home.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>DCM: But my whole thing is if this is consent…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>JB:     Yeah.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>DCM: … it’s consent and that would explain everything, then I
    can go back and talk to them.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>JB:     You know what?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>DCM: And I’ll be back and let them know my update.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this line of questioning did not cross the line into improper police
    inducement. Detective McLean testified, and the trial judge accepted in his
    ruling, that his intention in adopting this approach was to reduce the moral
    blameworthiness of the appellant’s acts, making it easier for him to tell the
    truth about what had happened.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    Detective McLean did not tell the appellant that the charges would be dropped
    if the sex with the complainant was consensual. Indeed, when the appellant
    asked him a question about consensual sex, Detective McLean replied: “When… two
    people, two adults have consensual sex there’s no charge.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I note that the appellant testified at his trial. During cross-examination,
    this exchange occurred:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      I’m going to suggest to you that you admitted that you
    did it when you thought it wasn’t a crime.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      No.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      That’s the only reason you broke down…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      No.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q.      …because you believed that it wasn’t illegal to have
    sex with a 15 year old so you thought you were off the hook.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A.      <em>I know it’s illegal to have sex with a 15 year old</em> and I never had sex with a 15 year old.                                                                               [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, I do not think that Detective McLean’s language during the consent
    component of the interview amounted to an improper inducement. </p>
