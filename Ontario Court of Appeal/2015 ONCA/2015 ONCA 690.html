  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the decision of the Summary Conviction
    Appeal Court dated October 17, 2014 by Justice Peter A. Douglas of the Superior
    Court of Justice, dismissing the appeal from the conviction entered on January
    17, 2014 by Justice John D.D. Evans of the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant, a
    niece of his common-law wife. He seeks leave to appeal from the decision of the
    Summary Conviction Appeal Judge (SCAJ) dismissing his appeal from conviction.
    The appellant submits that the SCAJ committed two errors in his decision.
    First, the SCAJ erred by concluding that there was no air of reality to the
    defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. Second, and consequently, the
    SCAJ erred by concluding that the trial judge had not erred by failing to turn
    his mind to that issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant and the appellant both attended a party celebrating her
    grandparents 50<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary. The party ended around 1:00
    a.m. The complainants parents were hosting several of the guests at their home
    overnight, so the complainant drove a group of them, including the appellant, to
    her parents house in a van. When they arrived at the house, the appellant
    remained passed out in the van from his alcohol consumption. The appellant woke
    up in between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., and went into the house. The appellant
    went into the complainants bedroom. Initially, it was intended that the
    appellant and his wife would be staying in that room. However, on that night,
    the complainant was sleeping in her bedroom. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond this point, the evidence at trial relates two different
    scenarios. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the complainant, the appellant entered her room, began
    sexually touching her and then performed oral sex on her. The complainant
    thought she was having a dream. She admitted that her body movements assisted the
    appellant in removing her shorts. The oral sex persisted for about five minutes,
    and caused the complainant to wake up. At this point, the appellant stood up
    and removed his pants. The complainant was then able to identify the man before
    her as the appellant. He put her hand on his penis, but she quickly removed it.
    He then attempted to push her legs apart and she resisted. He continued to push
    on her legs and responded with something along the lines of whats the
    matter? The complainant then jumped out of bed and ran out of the room. The
    complainant testified that she believed the appellant thought she was his wife,
    as they had a similar build and his wife was initially supposed to stay in that
    room.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant denied having any sort of sexual interactions
    with the complainant or his wife that night. He says he entered the
    complainants room, thought that the person sleeping in the bed was his wife,
    and fell asleep naked beside her in the bed. The appellant denied that he had
    engaged in sexual activity with anyone believing that she was his spouse.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Trial Judges Decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found the complainant to be credible and rejected the
    evidence of the appellant. He held that the appellant was guilty beyond a
    reasonable doubt of the sexual assault of the complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, the appellant denied any sexual contact on the night at issue.
    The defence of mistaken belief in consent was not raised by the appellant. The
    trial judge commented that, because the appellant denied any sexual encounter
    with the complainant, he was not suggesting that he had an honest but mistaken
    belief in consent. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Appeal Decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ accepted that an accused is entitled to rely upon all alternate
    defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record. This applies to
    any defence, whether or not raised in submissions by the defence, which has an
    air of reality. To meet the air of reality test, there must be some evidence
    upon which a properly instructed trier of fact, acting reasonably, could acquit
    if it believed the evidence to be true.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ noted that the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent
    may be available to an accused even though he does not testify that he held
    that belief. However, in this case, the SCAJ concluded that the evidence at
    trial provided no foundation for an air of reality to the defence of honest but
    mistaken belief. The complainants belief as to the appellants state of mind
    was purely speculative. Further, the complainant was not consciously trying to
    assist the appellant in taking off her pants, so this did not go towards
    creating an honest but mistaken belief in consent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    SCAJ determined that the verdict was reasonable and the trial judge did not
    err.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Analysis </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute that the SCAJ correctly articulated the air of reality test. Before
    this court, the appellant suggests that a defence based on the appellants
    mistaken identification of the complainant was also available.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    appeal lies to this court, with leave on questions of law alone, pursuant to s.
    839 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Whether there is an air of reality to a
    defence does raise a question of law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As explained in <em>R. v. R.R.</em>, 2008 ONCA 497, 90 O.R. (3d)
    641, at para. 37, leave to appeal will be granted only: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where the merits of a proposed question of law are arguable, if
    not strong, and the issue has significance to the administration of justice
    generally; or</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where there appears to be a clear error in the particular case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant concedes that his appeal does not meet the first branch of the test. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    there is no clear error identifiable in the reasons of the SCAJ. As the Alberta
    Court of Appeal pointed out in <em>R. v. Flaviano</em>, 2013 ABCA 219, affd
    2014 SCC 14, at para. 46: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[We] accept that the law does not currently require the
    accused's testimony to establish an air of reality to the defence  that it may
    be found in the evidence of other witnesses. However, as the ultimate issue
    requires an assessment of whether the accused honestly held, or may have held,
    such a belief, it obviously may be negated by the testimony of the accused. For
    example, where an accused asserts he had no sexual contact of any kind with the
    complainant, it would be fantasy to speculate that he was lying on that point,
    but to then attribute to him a defence completely incompatible with his
    evidence, namely that he was the assailant but he may have been operating on a
    mistaken belief. [Citation omitted.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has not identified any exceptional circumstances which would justify
    a second appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal is denied.</p>
