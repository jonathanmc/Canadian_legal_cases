  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John S. Fregeau of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated April 8, 2014, granting <em>certiorari</em> setting aside the order of Justice Frank Valente of the Ontario Court of
    Justice, dated November 12, 2013, issuing <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em> to
    certain witnesses.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Watt J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Confidential informants and drug investigators are trading partners.
    Information for anonymity. And anonymity for information. Unless, of course,
    disclosure is necessary to demonstrate the innocence of an accused. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In line with this arrangement, Ontario police forces and police services
    boards are required to establish procedures and processes in respect of
    informants and agents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several persons charged with a variety of drug and criminal organization
    offences wanted to find out whether the police forces who arrested them
    followed these procedures and processes during their lengthy investigation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The request for information began with the prosecutor. It failed. The
    prosecutor said that what they sought was irrelevant and privileged and
    besides, the prosecutor did not have the information those charged requested. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So the persons charged applied <em>ex parte</em> to a justice of the
    peace. They asked the justice of the peace to issue a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> to the person in charge of each investigating police force. Under the subpoena
    each person in charge would be required to bring the information sought to
    court on the return date of the subpoena. The justice of the peace declined to
    issue the subpoenas, deferring to the authority of the judge presiding at the
    preliminary inquiry into the charges that was well under way. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preliminary inquiry judge issued the subpoenas. The officers in
    charge were required to appear at the preliminary inquiry and to bring with
    them the information requested. The judge would permit submissions by any
    interested party on the return date including submissions about privilege. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two police forces affected by the issuance of the subpoenas applied to a
    judge of the Superior Court of Justice to quash the subpoenas. Their
    application succeeded. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecution in which these proceedings arose has ended. Each of the
    persons charged has pleaded guilty. Each has been sentenced for his or her
    involvement. It follows that this appeal is moot. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These reasons explain why I consider this to be an appeal we should
    decide despite its mootness and why I would dismiss it. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>THE BACKGROUND</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    nature of the issues raised renders unnecessary any discussion of the
    circumstances of the offences charged or the evidence collected by the Crown to
    prove those offences. A brief reference to the procedural history of the
    prosecution will suffice. More detail will be provided as required in analyzing
    each ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Offences Charged </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brandie
    Mosher, Zahed Khan, Justin Cain and Rashad Khan (the persons charged) were
    charged with several counts of conspiracy to traffic in oxycodone and cocaine,
    as well as various criminal organization offences. They elected trial in the
    Superior Court of Justice and opted to have a preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    lengthy investigation preceded the charges. The investigative procedures used
    to gather evidence included the authorized interception of private
    communications. The supportive affidavits relied on information supplied by
    confidential informants. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Disclosure Request</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    they claimed no interest in any information that identified or tended to
    identify any confidential informant, counsel for the persons charged sought
    disclosure of what they described as informant directives and/or police
    procedures from the officers in charge of two investigating police forces: the
    Thunder Bay Police Service (TBPS) and the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).
    They sought this information so that they could pursue a <em>Dawson</em><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a><em> </em>application at the preliminary inquiry and later an application to
    cross-examine the affiants and sub-affiants to advance a <em>Garofoli</em><a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a><em> </em>application at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    persons charged sought disclosure of the information from the prosecutor. The
    prosecutor rejected the request on the bases that the requested materials were
    in the custody of the police forces and were at once irrelevant and privileged. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Subpoena Request</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    persons charged then adopted a different course. They applied <em>ex parte</em> to a justice of the peace for <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em>. The subpoenas
    would require the officer in charge of each of the TBPS and OPP to attend the
    preliminary inquiry and to bring with him the materials counsel sought. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace refused to issue the subpoenas. He reasoned that to do so
    would encroach upon the jurisdiction of the judge presiding over the then
    ongoing preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Second
    Subpoena Request</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry continued. Counsel for the persons charged reinvigorated
    their request for subpoenas. The affected police forces were not represented.
    The prosecutor was present. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry judge issued the subpoenas, which required the attendance
    of the officers in charge with the requested documents three days later. The
    judge made it clear that on the return of the subpoenas he would entertain
    submissions by counsel relative to the manner in which the subpoenaed
    materials [were] to be received pending a determination of any claim of
    privilege that [might] be advanced in relation to these materials. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Reasons of the Preliminary
    Inquiry Judge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry judge pointed out that the persons charged were not seeking
    information relating to the specific informants involved in the investigation, but
    only the policy directives and/or protocols that investigators were required to
    follow in dealing with informants. The judge also noted that the prosecutor did
    not challenge his (the judges) jurisdiction to issue the subpoenas. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry judge was satisfied that, during the investigation,
    confidential informants had provided information to the police that was used to
    obtain Part VI authorizations and production orders. The judge concluded that
    the materials sought would be relevant to a <em>Dawson </em>application and to
    the purposes of the preliminary inquiry. He noted that, given the disclosure
    difficulties that had occurred, he would have exercised his discretion to issue
    the subpoenas even in the absence of any <em>Dawson</em> or <em>Dawson</em>-type
    application. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    does not appear to have been suggested to the preliminary inquiry judge that
    the materials sought were third party records that required adherence to the
    regime put in place by <em>R. v. OConnor</em>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Motion to
    Quash</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    affected police forces applied to a judge of the Superior Court of Justice (the
    motion judge) to quash the subpoenas. Each alleged jurisdictional error,
    allegations which will be outlined later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Decision of the Motion Judge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge quashed the subpoenas. He pointed out that production of the
    documents had first been sought by a disclosure request of the prosecutor. When
    that failed, the persons charged took another route  the <em>subpoena duces
    tecum</em>  to get the same relief. When the preliminary inquiry judge
    entertained the application, the motion judge reasoned, he effectively heard a
    disclosure application that was reserved for the trial judge and beyond the
    jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge. The issuance of the subpoenas
    was, in effect, a production order and equally beyond the authority of the
    preliminary inquiry judge. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Subsequent Proceedings</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime
    after the order of the motion judge quashing the subpoenas, the persons charged
    resolved their charges by guilty pleas. As a result, the issue of their guilt
    of the offences charged has been resolved. The prosecution has ended. </p>
  <p class=Heading>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Setting
    to one side the issue of mootness, the (now) appellants allege that the motion
    judge erred in three respects: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in violating the principle of <em>audi alteram partem </em>by deciding
    the motion on a ground not argued by counsel; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in equating the issuance of <em>subpoenas duces tecum </em>with a
    disclosure order; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in requiring an <em>OConnor </em>application to the trial judge for
    records that could not possibly engage a privacy interest. </p>
  <p class=Heading>A Threshold Issue: Mootness</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    threshold issue arises because the proceedings in which the appellants sought
    to use the documents, their preliminary inquiry and trial, no longer exist. The
    appellants have pleaded guilty and have been sentenced for their involvement in
    the offences charged. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    TBPS has raised the issue of mootness and invites dismissal on that ground. The
    appellants and other respondents acknowledge that the appeal is moot but
    expressly or impliedly suggest that it should be decided because of the
    importance of the issues raised and the absence of binding precedent on the
    subject. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Governing
    Principles</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    doctrine of mootness is an aspect of a general policy or practice that a court
    may decline to decide a case which raises a hypothetical or abstract question.
    This general principle applies when a courts decision will not, in effect,
    resolve some controversy that affects or may affect the rights of the parties.
    As a general rule, courts decline to decide cases in which their decision will
    have no practical effect on the parties. This essential element  a <em>lis
    inter partes </em> must exist not only when the proceeding commences, but also
    when the court is assigned the task of deciding it: <em>Borowski v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at p. 353; <em>Mental Health
    Centre Penetanguishene v. Ontario</em>, 2010 ONCA 197, 260 O.A.C. 125, at para.
    35. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    doctrine of mootness is of general, but not unyielding, application. Sometimes
    it gives way: a court has and may exercise a discretion to depart from the
    doctrine: <em>Borowski</em>, at p. 353; <em>Mental Health Centre</em>, at para.
    36.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    approach taken by a court confronted with a claim of mootness involves two
    steps. The first step requires a determination whether the essential tangible
    and concrete dispute  the <em>lis inter partes </em> has disappeared and the
    issues have become academic.  If the response at this first step is
    affirmative, the second step requires the court to decide whether it should
    exercise its discretion to hear the case: <em>Borowski</em>, at p. 353; <em>Mental
    Health Centre</em>, at para. 36.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    formulation of guidelines for the exercise of discretion in departing from the
    usual practice is informed by an examination of the rationalia underlying that practice.
    To the extent that a particular foundation for the practice is either absent or
    its presence tenuous, the reasons for adherence to the practice disappear or
    diminish. An examination of the authorities does not yield a neat set of
    criteria: <em>Borowski</em>, at p. 358.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    basic rationalia underpin the mootness doctrine: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that a courts competence to resolve legal disputes is rooted in the
    adversary system that helps guarantee that issues are well and fully argued by
    parties who have a stake in the outcome; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the concern for judicial economy; and </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the need for the court to demonstrate an awareness of its proper
    law-making function and the limits of that function so as to avoid intrusions
    into the role of the legislative branch: <em>Borowski</em>, at pp. 358-62.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first rationale may be satisfied where the live controversy has ceased but the
    essential adversarial relationship nevertheless prevails. Collateral
    consequences may provide the necessary adversarial context: <em>Borowski</em>,
    at pp. 358-9.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second rationale  the concern for judicial economy  may be met in cases which
    are at once moot but of a recurring nature and brief duration. A flexible
    application of the mootness doctrine ensures that important questions, which
    might independently evade review, are heard and decided by the court: <em>Borowski</em>,
    at p. 360.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    somewhat more amorphous basis to justify the deployment of limited judicial
    resources arises in cases that involve issues of public importance of which a
    resolution is in the public interest. The economies of judicial involvement are
    balanced against the social cost of continued legal uncertainty: <em>Borowski</em>,
    at p. 361.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    exercising its discretion to hear and determine an appeal that is moot, a court
    should consider the extent to which each of the three distinct rationalia for
    the mootness doctrine is present. The process is not mechanical. The principles
    may point in opposite directions. The absence of a third may overbear the
    presence of one or two. And vice versa: <em>Borowski</em>, at p. 363.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Principles Applied</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my respectful view, this appeal is moot for want of a live controversy or
    concrete dispute. The substratum of this appeal has vanished, as I will briefly
    explain. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>lis inter partes</em> arose in the context of the prosecution of the
    several appellants for a fistful of drug and criminal organization offences. To
    be more specific, the controversy emerged at the preliminary inquiry because
    the appellants sought disclosure or production of copies of any and all policy
    directives and/or protocols related to the documenting and tracking of
    confidential informants and agents of investigating police forces. They sought
    these documents at the preliminary inquiry to advance a <em>Dawson</em> application there and to prepare the ground for a <em>Garofoli</em> application, including an application to cross-examine the affiant, at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the usual course, an accused who seeks such disclosure or production would
    bring a disclosure application under <em>Stinchcombe</em><a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> or <em>OConnor</em>. But here the appellants were before a judge who lacked <em>Stinchcombe</em> and <em>OConnor</em> authority. So they sought and obtained <em>subpoenas
    duces tecum</em> in the hope that they would obtain the equivalent result 
    disclosure or production  at the preliminary inquiry. They obtained the
    subpoenas, but the motion judge quashed them for reasons described earlier. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the hearing of the appeal, however, the preliminary inquiry was no longer
    ongoing. It had concluded and along with it the purposes for which the
    documents were sought. Nor were trial proceedings outstanding or ongoing. No
    trial occurred. The appellants gave up their right to a trial and to challenge
    the admissibility and sufficiency of the Crowns proof by pleading guilty. No <em>Garofoli </em>application would be pursued. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the appellants were to succeed on appeal, restoration of the <em>subpoenas
    duces tecum</em> would have no practical effect for want of any extant
    preliminary inquiry at which the witness would be required to appear with the
    documents. And so it is that the appeal is moot. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    several reasons, however, I would exercise our discretion to decide the issues
    raised in this appeal despite their mootness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the issues raised in this appeal are not unique to these appellants or to the
    police services whose documents are sought. Although not of everyday frequency,
    they are apt to arise in cases in which the Crown tenders evidence of private
    communications intercepted under an authorization that has been granted at
    least in part based on information provided by confidential informants. The
    same could be said where the Crown tenders evidence obtained on the execution
    of a search warrant issued based on an information to obtain (ITO) containing
    information from a confidential informant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the issues raised in this appeal remain alive only briefly at a preliminary
    inquiry. As a result, they are elusive of appellate review, in part at least
    because Crown counsel has the authority to terminate the inquiry and invoke s.
    577(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, to indict the
    persons charged directly in the superior court of criminal jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    we are concerned here with a procedural issue of some importance. It is a
    matter of first impression in an appellate court. Accepting as we must that a
    preliminary inquiry judge has no authority to make a disclosure order under
    either <em>Stinchcombe</em> or <em>OConnor</em>, can an accused invoke the
    authority of the presiding judge to issue a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> as a
    means to obtain at least partial disclosure?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    while it may seem inimical to judicial economy to determine this, or any, moot
    appeal, the expenditure involved may yield dividends in the future by ensuring
    that preliminary inquiries are not interrupted needlessly to pursue unavailable
    remedies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the appeal was fully argued by all interested parties based on a complete
    record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would exercise our discretion to determine the issues raised
    despite the absence of a <em>lis inter partes</em>. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Ground #1: Failure to Follow the <em>Audi Alteram Partem</em> Principle </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first ground of appeal asserts a violation of the principle of <em>audi alteram
    partem</em> because the motion judge, the appellants contend, quashed the
    subpoenas on a ground that had not been advanced in argument by either affected
    police force on the hearing of the motion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    brief reference to the proceedings in which the subpoenas were issued and later
    quashed is essential to an understanding and determination of this ground. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Issuance
    of the <em>Subpoenas Duces Tecum</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants first request for <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em> was rejected by
    the justice of the peace to whom it was made. Typically, the persons whose
    attendance was sought and the prosecutor are not notified of the application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second request for <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em> was to the judge presiding at
    the preliminary inquiry. Formal notice of the application was not provided to
    the affected police forces or to those whose attendance was sought. The
    prosecutor was present and participated in the hearing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the return date of the subpoenas, counsel for the affected police forces
    attended and advised the preliminary inquiry judge that they considered the
    documents subject to public interest privilege. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Motion to
    Quash the Subpoenas</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    affected police forces moved to quash the subpoenas before a judge of the Superior
    Court of Justice. They submitted that the preliminary inquiry judge committed
    jurisdictional error by: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failing to consider whether the materials sought were third party
    records and thus subject to the disclosure regime of <em>OConnor</em>; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>issuing the subpoenas thereby assuming jurisdiction over third party

  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>issuing subpoenas to compel production of documents that could only be
    ordered produced by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Decision of the Motion Judge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge recited the procedural history of the applications for the
    subpoenas and found it unnecessary to decide whether the information requested
    was subject to the first party disclosure regime of <em>Stinchcombe</em> or the
    third party protocol of <em>OConnor</em>. The motion judge concluded that the
    issuance of the <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em> was, in effect, a production
    order for documents in the possession of a third party. Such an order, the
    judge reasoned, was beyond the jurisdiction of a preliminary inquiry judge,
    rather fell within the exclusive authority of a judge presiding or designated
    to preside at the appellants trial. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Arguments
    on Appeal </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that the<em> audi alteram partem</em> principle requires that a
    party to a proceeding have notice of a hearing and a full opportunity to be
    heard by the decider on issues that will form the basis of the decision. The
    principle was offended here because the respondents applied for relief solely
    on the basis that the subpoenas encroached on <em>OConnor </em>territory and
    thus were beyond the jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge. At the
    preliminary inquiry, the prosecutor conceded that the preliminary inquiry judge
    had jurisdiction to issue the subpoenas. The order of the motion judge should
    be set aside on this ground alone and the issue considered afresh here. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent TBPS submits that the <em>audi alteram partem</em> principle was not
    offended in this case. The relief sought before the motion judge was not
    grounded exclusively on an infringement or encroachment on <em>OConnor</em> turf. The contention of the police forces and the prosecutor was that what was
    sought  production of informant procedure  was obtainable only by a
    disclosure application to the trial judge, not by a subpoena issued by the
    presiding judge at the preliminary inquiry. In every event, the basis upon
    which the motion judge decided the issue could have been easily anticipated by
    the appellants. Any tacit acknowledgement of jurisdiction in the preliminary
    inquiry judge is unavailing since consent cannot confer jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent OPP acknowledges that it did not raise the issue of the jurisdiction
    of the preliminary inquiry judge to hear a general disclosure application. That
    said, the prosecutor did contest the preliminary inquiry judges jurisdiction
    to order <em>de facto</em> disclosure. It follows, according to the OPP, that
    the appellants were well aware of the issue of jurisdiction and had ample
    opportunity to respond to it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent Crown made no specific submissions on this issue but characterized
    the core question as whether a preliminary inquiry judge can issue a <em>subpoena
    duces tecum</em> to secure production of documents that are the subject of a
    disclosure or production dispute. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Governing Principles</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    brief points about the <em>audi alteram partem</em> principle are adequate to
    mark out the boundaries of the principle. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principle is an amalgam of two components. Each is a right accorded to a party
    in a proceeding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    a right of audience. Said in another way, the right to be heard by the
    decision-maker. This right compels the decision-maker to allow the party to be
    heard so that the party has the opportunity to present his or her point of
    view: <em>Supermarchés Jean Labrecque Inc. v. Flamand</em>, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
    219, at pp. 234-35. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    and this arises out of the right to be heard, notice of the hearing sufficient
    in time and substance to enable the party to present his or her case on the
    issues to be decided: <em>Telecommunications Workers Union v. Canada
    (Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission)</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 781,
    at para. 29; <em>Supermarchés Jean Labrecque</em>, at p. 235.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Principles
    Applied</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    several reasons, I would reject this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the nature of the remedy sought before the motion judge. The respondents sought
    an extraordinary remedy  <em>certiorari</em>  which invokes the supervisory
    jurisdiction of the superior court to ensure that courts or judges whose
    jurisdiction is limited, by statute or otherwise, stay within that
    jurisdiction. The modern equivalent of the prerogative writ of <em>certiorari</em>  the motion to quash  quashes orders made or process issued in excess of the
    authority of the courts or judicial officers of limited jurisdiction. To put it
    in more general terms, the remedy sought by the respondents challenged the
    jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge to issue the subpoenas. Whether
    the preliminary inquiry judge remained within or strayed outside the limits of
    his jurisdiction was at the forefront of the proceedings before the motion
    judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the notice of application, the materials filed in support and the submissions
    made at the hearing put the appellants on notice that the prosecutor and the
    affected police forces considered the materials sought third party records. The
    sole means of gaining access to those materials, the police and prosecutor
    argued, was an <em>OConnor</em> application. If this argument carried the day
    before the motion judge, it necessarily followed that the subpoenas had been
    issued without jurisdiction and could not have achieved the production or
    disclosure sought. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the application to the preliminary inquiry judge for <em>subpoenas duces tecum </em>was
    made without notice to the police forces whose directives were sought. It
    scarcely surprises that the forces raised no jurisdictional issue at first
    instance. Even if the prosecutor did not contest jurisdiction at the
    preliminary inquiry, acquiescence does not confer jurisdiction through waiver
    of a condition that cannot be waived: <em>Township of Cornwall v. Ottawa and
    New York Railway Co. et al</em> (1916), 52 S.C.R. 466, at pp. 496-7. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    the end, I am satisfied that the basis on which the motion judge decided to
    quash the subpoenas did not offend the <em>audi alteram partem</em> principle. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Ground #2: Alleged Error in
    Finding Issuance of Subpoenas the Functional Equivalent of a Disclosure Order</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second error alleged takes aim at the motion judges conclusion that, in the
    circumstances of this case, the issuance of the subpoenas was the functional
    equivalent of a disclosure order that was beyond the jurisdiction of the
    preliminary inquiry judge to make. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    brief reference to the basis on which the subpoenas were sought and later
    quashed furnishes the background essential for a determination of this issue. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Decision of the Preliminary
    Inquiry Judge </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants first sought the materials from the prosecutor asserting that they
    were properly disclosable. The prosecutor refused disclosure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the preliminary inquiry judge, the appellants advanced their claim for the
    issuance of the subpoenas on the ground that the materials were necessary for
    them to pursue a <em>Dawson </em>application at the preliminary inquiry and a <em>Garofoli</em> application at trial. At the preliminary inquiry, a police witness had
    testified that policy guidelines for handling confidential informants did exist
    and had been applied in connection with the informants who had provided
    investigators with information in this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry judge considered his authority to issue subpoenas to be
    incontrovertible. Mindful of the requirement that he be satisfied the witnesses
    to be subpoenaed had material evidence to give, he concluded: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]n my view, the policy manuals or guidelines would be
    likely material given that in my view, it or they, would be relevant to any
    such <em>Dawson </em>application or <em>Dawson </em>type applications and in my
    view, would also be relevant to the purposes of the preliminary inquiry -- if
    not to the primary purpose, (committal or discharge) -- at the very least to
    the secondary or ancillary function of the inquiry. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>He added: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I would have exercised in my discretion and jurisdiction to
    allow the instant application even in the absence of any <em>Dawson</em> application or any <em>Dawson</em> type application, proposed though those
    applications may remain at this juncture. A fortiori because of those applications.
    In my view, the policy manuals or guidelines would be relevant and material to
    the course of this preliminary inquiry as those terms are referred to and
    applied in the cases to which I have already made reference.</p>

    materials were not in the possession of the Crown, but rather in the custody of
    the police, and were irrelevant and protected by confidential informant
    privilege. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge was satisfied that the documents were material. Three brief paragraphs
    of his reasons reflect the essence of his decision to quash the subpoenas: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[49] While production of the subject documents would no doubt
    be useful to the defence for the purposes of the preliminary inquiry, they are
    not in a position to compel their production at this stage. The respondents are
    entitled to bring a <em>Stinchcombe/McNeil</em> [<em>sic</em>]<em> </em>application
    and/or an <em>OConnor</em> application for production of this material, the
    latter being on notice to the record holders. This will allow the applicants a
    hearing on the issue of the status of the records and whether or not they
    should be produced. These applications must be brought before the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[50] This issue was not put before Valente J. nor could it have
    been on the preliminary inquiry. Valente J. was sensitive to the issue of
    public interest privilege because it was raised before him on November 15,
    2013, when the respondents appeared at the preliminary inquiry with the
    subpoenaed documents. Valente J. invited submissions from any interested party
    on the issue of privilege and as to the manner in which the subpoenaed
    materials are to be received by the court</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[51] The position taken by Valente J. on November 15, 2013 does
    not, however, alter the fact that he had, while sitting as a preliminary
    inquiry justice, effectively ordered the production of documents the Crown had
    declined to disclose and/or which were not in the Crowns possession. I
    therefore find that he exceeded his jurisdiction by issuing the subpoenas in
    the first instance on November 12, 2013.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Arguments on Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants begin with the uncontroversial. The preliminary inquiry judge had
    jurisdiction to issue subpoenas, including <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em>,
    provided he was satisfied that the witness to whom the subpoena was to be
    issued had material evidence to give at the inquiry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that the motion judge erred by focusing on the prosecutors
    refusal to provide disclosure, rather than on the fact that the materials were
    not in the Crowns possession for disclosure purposes. Counsel for the
    appellants had a positive obligation to secure evidence and information not in
    the possession or control of the Crown that they considered relevant and
    material to the defence case. The motion judge erred in finding that the
    prosecutors refusal to disclose materials, which he did not have, estopped
    defence counsel from exercising their own due diligence to secure the
    materials. The means chosen were legally available and an appropriate method to
    do so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent OPP contends that the motion judge did not err in concluding that,
    in the circumstances of this case, issuance of the subpoenas was the functional
    equivalent of a disclosure order. As a statutory court with only statutory
    authority, a preliminary inquiry judge lacks any inherent jurisdiction to make
    a disclosure order and is foreclosed by binding authority from doing so. In
    this case, the subpoena required the production of documents and thus amounted
    to a disclosure order, a direction beyond the jurisdiction of a preliminary
    inquiry judge to give. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent TBPS does not challenge the general authority of a preliminary
    inquiry judge to issue a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em>. But a problem arises, the
    TBPS says, when the subpoena compels the <em>disclosure</em> of third party
    records. The <em>Criminal Code</em> assigns to the preliminary inquiry judge
    the responsibility of deciding whether the evidence adduced at the inquiry is
    sufficient to justify the committal of the persons charged. The scope of the
    inquiry is statutorily prescribed and confined. It does not authorize inquiry
    into other issues or permit the presiding judge to order production of
    documents not related to the committal mandate and with no conceivable bearing
    on that issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent TBPS says that even if a preliminary inquiry judge has authority to
    issue <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em> to require a witness to attend with
    documents, the judge has no authority to compel the witness to turn the
    document over once a privacy or other interest is asserted. When this occurs,
    the party who seeks the document must follow the scheme put in place by <em>OConnor </em>to obtain disclosure, a procedure that cannot be invoked at the
    preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent Crown characterizes the dispute as a classic wrangle about disclosure.
    It is <em>not </em>a controversy about what materials a testifying witness can
    be compelled to produce. The squabble involves third party records, that is to
    say, records not in the possession or control of the Crown or part of the case to
    meet, and their production to the persons charged. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent Crown points out that the purpose of a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>is
    to compel a witness to <em>bring</em> listed documents to court with him or
    her. The subpoena gets the documents to court, but does not automatically entitle
    an opposite party to disclosure or possession of the documents. Production 
    the act of giving or providing a document to another  falls to be decided
    under the <em>OConnor </em>regime. The subpoena cannot serve as a functional
    equivalent or surrogate for a disclosure order made under <em>OConnor</em>. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Governing
    Principles </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal can be resolved by the application of general principles
    regarding the authority to issue subpoenas and the nature and extent of their
    reach. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 698(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, a competent authority may issue a
    subpoena to a person who is likely to <em>give material evidence</em> in a
    proceeding governed by the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The subpoena is directed to
    a named person and requires that person to <em>attend</em>, at a time and place
    stated in the subpoena, to give evidence for the prosecution or defence, as the
    case may be. The subpoena may be in Form 16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 700(1), a subpoena may also require the person to whom it is directed to <em>bring</em> with him or her anything that the person has in his or her possession or under
    his or her control relating to the subject-matter of the proceedings. Neither
    this form of subpoena  a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em>  nor the enabling
    authority in s. 700(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> say anything about what
    happens to or with the documents that accompany the witness. Not about access.
    Or copying. Or production to the court. Or to any party. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issuing authority for subpoenas depends upon the court before which the witness
    will be directed to attend. A preliminary inquiry, a proceeding over which a
    justice has jurisdiction, is governed by s. 699(2)(a) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. The issuing authority may be either a justice or a provincial court
    judge where, as here, the witness is within the province in which the proceedings
    have been instituted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    699(2)(a) does not expressly require that the issuing justice be the justice
    who is presiding at the preliminary inquiry. Nor does any such requirement
    arise by necessary implication from the language used in s. 699(2)(a). Where
    the issuing authority is the justice presiding at the preliminary inquiry,
    however, he or she issues the process <em>qua</em> justice, not as the judge
    (or justice) presiding at the preliminary inquiry: <em>R. v. Regan</em> (1997),
    113 C.C.C. (3d) 237 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal refused [1997] S.C.C.A. No.
    129, at pp. 243, 252. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>requires the person to whom it is issued to
    attend court at a time and place specified to give evidence for a party and to
    bring anything in his or her control relating to the subject-matter of the
    proceedings to court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>does <em>not</em>, in terms, require the witness
    to <em>produce</em> to either party what the witness has brought in compliance
    with the subpoena: <em>OConnor</em>, at paras. 103, 185. We see this distinction
    reflected in the kinds of subpoena, the statutory procedure for third party
    records and the rejection of the subpoena as a production device in <em>R. v.
    French</em> (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 201 (Ont. C.A.), affd [1980] 1 S.C.R. 158, at
    pp. 213-14. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Principles
    Applied</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge erred to the extent that he characterized the <em>subpoena duces
    tecum </em>as the functional equivalent of a production order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> compels the <em>appearance</em> of the person to
    whom the subpoena has been issued at the inquiry and requires that person to <em>bring </em>with him or her anything that he has in his possession or under his
    control relating to the subject-matter of the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Thus
    the issuance of a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> is not an order for production
    or disclosure of the documents the witness is required to bring on the return
    of the subpoena. Said differently, issue of a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> without more is not a disclosure order or its functional equivalent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, this error is immaterial to the result of this appeal given the
    conclusion I reach regarding Ground #3.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Ground #3: <em>OConnor</em> as the Appropriate Procedural
    Mechanism</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final ground of appeal challenges the <em>OConnor </em>procedure as the
    appropriate mechanism to obtain production or disclosure of the records the
    appellants seek. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    earlier paragraphs I have canvassed the relevant circumstances that support
    this claim of error and excerpted the appropriate passages in the trial judges
    reasons that explain his conclusion. Repetition here is unnecessary. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Arguments
    on Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants acknowledge at the outset that they took the position before the
    motion judge that the affected police services were first parties and thus
    required to provide the requested materials to the prosecuting Crown for
    disclosure to the accused. The Crown was put on notice of the request but
    denied possession or control and did nothing to obtain the records and thus
    comply with its <em>Stinchcombe</em> disclosure obligations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellants say that it is of no moment whether the records fall
    within first or third party disclosure obligations. The crux of the issue is
    whether production or disclosure can be achieved by service of a <em>subpoena
    duces tecum</em>. The <em>OConnor</em> regime does not apply to these records
    because there is neither a reasonable expectation of privacy, or even an
    arguable claim of such an expectation attaching to them. Such an actual or
    arguable expectation of privacy is essential before the <em>OConnor</em>/<em>McNeil</em><a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> regime governs; witness the second stage of the <em>O'Connor </em>inquiry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the appellants contend, the materials sought do not give rise to even an
    arguable expectation of privacy. The directives are quasi-legislative in
    nature. They are required by legislation. They govern all interactions between
    police forces and confidential informants. They are not created solely for this
    investigation. They do not contain any privileged materials; else they would
    breach the law enforcement obligation to ensure anonymity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents uniformly reject the appellants submissions on this ground.
    However coloured, what the appellants sought was <em>disclosure </em>of third
    party records. A <em>subpoena duces tecum</em>, the procedural vehicle they
    chose, cannot achieve what they seek. And a preliminary inquiry judge is not
    the proper forum in which to seek disclosure. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent
    OPP says that the directives sought are not fruits of the investigation, not in
    the possession or control of the prosecuting Crown and thus not subject to the
    first party disclosure obligations of <em>Stinchcombe</em>. These directives,
    which are policies of general application not unique to the circumstances of
    this case, are third party records. An order for their disclosure must be
    sought from and can only be made by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The respondent
    TBPS submits that the materials sought trench upon the privacy interest of the TBPS
    and thus are third party records disclosable only according to the <em>OConnor </em>procedure. But in the end, the nature of the privacy interest asserted in
    the materials is of no moment  a preliminary inquiry justice has no authority
    to make an order for production under <em>OConnor</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent
    Crown says that <em>OConnor</em>, together with <em>McNeil</em>, create a
    complete code for production of third party records. The procedure governs production
    of third party records, irrespective of a reasonable expectation of privacy in
    those records. The authority to order production resides in the exclusive
    jurisdiction of the trial judge or, in exceptional cases, in a judge of the
    superior court of criminal jurisdiction. A justice presiding at a preliminary
    inquiry is neither and thus cannot make a production order. Not directly. And
    not indirectly. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Governing Principles</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In earlier
    paragraphs of these reasons I have surveyed the principles that describe the issuance
    and effect of a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em>. Repetition is unwarranted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is useful,
    however, to outline the schemes governing the disclosure of information to a
    person charged with a criminal offence. Setting aside statutory schemes that
    authorize production of various kinds of records to certain persons (for
    example, in current ss. 487.014-487.018 or predecessor legislation) or when
    certain offences are charged or records sought (for example, ss. 278.1 and
    following), two such schemes exist. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disclosure of
    information in the possession or control of the prosecuting state agency, the
    fruits of the investigation, is governed by <em>Stinchcombe</em>. Disclosure of
    information or materials in the hands of a stranger to the litigation  a third
    party  is governed by the procedure mandated by <em>OConnor </em>and
    amplified by <em>McNeil</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of a
    disclosure order made under either regime is to get the subject-matter of the
    request into the hands of the person charged after resolution of any disputes
    about relevance and privilege. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A justice
    presiding at a preliminary inquiry is a statutory court of limited
    jurisdiction. The authority of the justice is coextensive with that granted
    either expressly or by necessary implication by the <em>Criminal Code</em>: <em>R.
    v. Doyle</em>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, at p. 602; <em>OConnor</em>, at para. 168;
    and <em>R. v. Girimonte</em> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 33 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
    21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Criminal
    Code</em> contains no provision that expressly authorizes a justice presiding
    at a preliminary inquiry to make a disclosure order. The primary function of
    the inquiry is to resolve the issue framed by s. 548(1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, that is to say, to determine whether the evidence adduced satisfies
    the standard for committal. A secondary or ancillary purpose of the inquiry is
    to afford the person charged an opportunity to discover and appreciate the case
    to be met: <em>OConnor</em>, at para. 169; <em>R. v. Skogman</em>, [1984] 2
    S.C.R. 93, at pp. 105-6.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In every event,
    it is clear that orders for disclosure under both the <em>Stinchcombe</em> and <em>OConnor</em> regimes are to be made only by the trial judge or, in some cases, by a judge of
    the superior court of criminal jurisdiction: <em>Girimonte</em>, at paras. 18,
    22; <em>OConnor</em>, at paras. 173-8.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Stinchcombe</em> or first party disclosure regime deals with information that is in the
    possession or control of the prosecuting authority. Information includes but is
    not limited to evidence, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, much less
    admissible evidence: <em>R. v. Chaplin</em>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 727, at para. 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>OConnor</em> regime applies to records in the possession or control of third parties. As a
    general rule, these records are ones to which a reasonable expectation of
    privacy attaches: <em>OConnor</em>, at paras. 36, 99. But the disclosure
    scheme is not premised on a reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents
    or records sought: <em>McNeil</em>, at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the
    authorities, expressly or by necessary implication, excludes materials created
    by statutory requirement from an applicable disclosure regime. The origin and
    nature of the materials will determine the applicable scheme and, as a
    consequence, the procedure to be followed to obtain disclosure. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the
    records are not part of the case to meet and are not in the possession or
    control of the prosecuting authority, the procedure to be followed to obtain
    disclosure is set out in paragraph 27 of the decision in <em>McNeil</em>. It
    begins with issuance of a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> and its service on a
    third party record holder. The accused brings an application in writing and
    serves it on the prosecuting Crown, the person who is the subject of the
    records, the record holder and anyone else who may have a privacy interest in
    the record. The application is brought before the judge seized with the trial.
    It is that judge who will resolve any claims of privilege before undertaking
    the two stage test constructed by <em>OConnor</em>: <em>McNeil</em>, at para.
    27.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Principles Applied</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject
    this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as I
    explained, a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>does two things. It compels the <em>attendance</em> of a person who has material evidence to give at a time and place specified.
    And it compels that person to <em>bring </em>with him or her anything that she
    or he has in his or her possession or under his or her control relating to the
    subject-matter of the proceedings. It does not require or authorize production
    of the documents to a party. The relevant inquiry for a justice requested to
    issue a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> is whether the proposed witness has material
    evidence to give, not whether he or she can bring something that the party to
    the proceeding requesting the subpoena wishes to have disclosed or produced for
    their review. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, here the
    irresistible inference is that the purpose of the <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>was
    not to obtain the testimony of the witness but to obtain disclosure of the
    specific documents each was requested to bring along. Thus the colourable use
    of the subpoena was for the remedy of production. This purpose appears the more
    obvious as the preliminary inquiry judge made it clear that he would permit the
    affected police forces to make submissions about privilege on the return of the
    subpoenas. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants,
    then, were, in effect, trying to do indirectly through a subpoena what they
    could not do directly through either of the <em>Stinchcombe </em>or <em>OConnor </em>regimes. The jurisdiction to grant the remedy of production lies with the
    trial judge, not the preliminary inquiry justice. While the preliminary inquiry
    justice has the jurisdiction to issue <em>subpoenas duces tecum</em>, they cannot
    be used by parties as a tool for circumventing this established jurisdictional limit.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the
    appellants submission that the <em>OConnor </em>regime could not apply due to
    a lack of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the directives is incorrect.
    As stated above, a reasonable expectation of privacy in the materials sought is
    not a condition precedent to the application of the <em>OConnor</em> regime. </p>
  <p class=Heading>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these
    reasons, I would determine the appeal on its merits despite its mootness and
    dismiss it as without merit. </p>
