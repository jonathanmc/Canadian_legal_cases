  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the orders of Justice Paul M. Perell of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated March 12, 2015, with reasons reported at
    2015 ONSC 1654.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Cronk J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This litigation arose from a ‘slip and fall’ accident that occurred in
    early 2007.  On motions by the respondents in the Superior Court of Justice,
    the motions judge granted summary judgments and dismissed the appellants’
    action as against both respondents.  In separate appeals heard together by this
    court, the appellants appeal from the motions judge’s orders.  These reasons address
    both appeals. </p>
  <p class=Heading>I.        Background in Brief</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 28, 2007, the appellant, Phil Miaskowski, slipped and fell on
    ice and snow on the driveway of a single-family residential property located at
    70 Jingle Crescent in Brampton (the “Property”).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accident occurred while Mr. Miaskowski was going to work.  At the
    time, he was employed at the Property by Alliance Youth Services Inc.
    (“Alliance”) as a caregiver for a young boy.  Steven Catney (“Mr. Catney Jr.”),
    a friend of Mr. Miaskowski and the son of the respondent, Terrence Catney (“Mr.
    Catney Sr.”), owned and operated Alliance, which carried on business at the
    Property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Property was owned by the respondent, Dustaff Persaud, who resided
    in the State of New York.  On February 2, 2007, shortly before the accident,
    Mr. Persaud, as landlord, had entered into a written residential lease with Mr.
    Catney Sr., as tenant, in respect of the Property (the “Lease”).  Schedule “A”
    to the Lease provides in part:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>The Tenant</em> shall keep the lawns in good condition and
    shall not injure or remove the shade trees, shrubbery, hedges or any other tree
    or plant which may be in, upon or about the premises, <em>and shall keep the
    sidewalks in front and at the sides of the premises free of snow and ice</em>. 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Lease contains no express provision assigning responsibility for the
    removal of snow and ice from the driveway, or for general winter maintenance,
    at the Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Miaskowski retained counsel in respect of the accident in April
    2007.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 24, 2008, Mr. Miaskowski commenced an action against Mr.
    Persaud, seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained by him in
    the accident.  He did not sue Alliance or Mr. Catney Jr.  Mr. Miaskowski
    claimed that Mr. Persaud had breached his duty of care as an occupier or owner
    of the Property under the <em>Occupiers’ Liability Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    O.2 (the “<em>OLA</em>”) and, further, that he had breached a common law duty
    of care owed to Mr. Miaskowski by failing to take any steps to ensure that the
    Property was safe from ice and snow conditions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 23, 2009, Mr. Persaud’s lawyer wrote Mr. Miaskowski’s
    lawyer, informing him that Mr. Catney Sr. was a tenant of the Property and
    suggesting that Mr. Catney Sr. be added as a co-defendant in the action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approximately five and one-half months passed.  On March 9, 2010, about
    three years after the accident, Mr. Miaskowski delivered an amended statement
    of claim in which he added Mr. Catney Sr. as a co-defendant.  Even then, Mr.
    Miaskowski did not seek to sue Alliance or Mr. Catney Jr.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Miaskowski was examined for discovery in mid-February 2011.  He admitted on his
    discovery that, at the time of the accident, he knew: Alliance occupied the
    Property but did not own it; Alliance was owned by his friend Mr. Catney Jr.;
    and the Property was rented.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 18, 2013, Mr. Persaud commenced third party proceedings against Mr.
    Catney Jr. and Alliance, seeking contribution and indemnity from them for any
    damages for which he might be held responsible in the main action, on the basis
    that they were liable as occupiers of the Property for breach of duties of care
    owed under the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    due course, Mr. Persaud and Mr. Catney Sr. both moved for summary judgment in
    the main action, as did Mr. Catney Jr. and Alliance in the third party proceedings
    commenced by Mr. Persaud.  The motions were heard together on March 5, 2015. 
    For differing reasons, the motions judge granted all three motions.  He dismissed
    the action as against both respondents, as well as the third party claim.  His latter
    ruling is not at issue on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>II.       The Catney Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his statement of defence, Mr. Catney Sr. acknowledged that he was an occupier
    of the Property, within the meaning of the <em>OLA</em>, at the time of the
    accident.  However, he pleaded that Mr. Miaskowski’s claim as against him was
    statute-barred due to the expiry of the applicable two-year limitation period
    under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B.
    (the “<em>Limitations Act</em>”).  He advanced the same argument in support of
    his summary judgment motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge agreed.  He held that, on February 28, 2007 – the date of the
    accident – Mr. Miaskowski knew that the Property was rented and that he had a
    “certain claim” against the tenant of the Property.  In these circumstances, by
    operation of s. 5(2) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, he was presumed to have
    known that he had a claim against the tenant of the Property within the meaning
    of s. 5(1)(a) of the statute on the day his injury had occurred, unless he led
    evidence rebutting this statutory presumption of the date on which he had
    discovered his claim.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge went on to hold that Mr. Miaskowski had failed to rebut the
    presumption that he had learned of his claim on February 28, 2007.  Mr.
    Miaskowski led no evidence establishing that he or his lawyer were reasonably
    diligent in attempting to identify the proper defendants to his claim, or to
    explain why they were unable to do so on a timely basis.  The effect of this
    finding was that the limitation period began to run on February 28, 2007 and
    expired on February 28, 2009, well before the commencement of the action
    against Mr. Catney Sr. on March 9, 2010.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the motions judge concluded that there was no genuine
    issue requiring a trial concerning the question whether Mr. Miaskowski’s action
    as against Mr. Catney Sr. was statute-barred.  He, therefore, granted summary
    judgment in favour of Mr. Catney Sr. and dismissed the action as against him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants challenge this ruling on three bases.  They argue that the motions
    judge erred: i) by concluding that this was an appropriate case for summary
    judgment; ii) by failing to properly apply the doctrine of discoverability; and
    iii) by finding that, if Alliance and Mr. Catney Jr. had been named originally
    as defendants in the main action, Mr. Miaskowski and his counsel would have
    discovered promptly that Mr. Catney Sr. should have been named as a defendant
    in the action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject these arguments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in my view, the motions judge did not err in concluding that this was an
    appropriate case for summary judgment in respect of the claim advanced against
    Mr. Catney Sr. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge considered the governing principles regarding summary judgment
    motions set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Hryniak v. Mauldin</em>,
    2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87.  Having addressed these principles, he
    concluded that he was positioned to fairly and justly adjudicate the limitation
    period dispute without the need for employing his expanded powers under r.
    20.04(2.1) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, and
    that a summary judgment would afford a timely and proportionate procedure for
    resolution of the action against Mr. Catney Sr.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the summary judgment motion, the facts relating to the limitation
    period dispute were known and essentially uncontroversial.  Contrary to the
    appellants’ submission, no serious credibility issues regarding the limitation
    period issue arose on the record.  As acknowledged by the appellants at the
    appeal hearing, the matters said by them to raise material credibility issues
    pertain to questions of law or matters peripheral to the controlling issue,
    namely, when the applicable two-year limitation period began to run.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    5(2) of the <em>Limitations Act</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A person with a claim shall be presumed to have known of the
    matters referred to in clause (1)(a) on the day the act or omission on which
    the claim is based took place, unless the contrary is proved. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    5(1)(a) and (b) of the <em>Limitations Act</em> read:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A claim is discovered on the earlier of,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a)     the day on which the person
    with the claim first knew,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(i)    that
    the injury, loss or damage had occurred,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(ii)   that
    the injury, loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or
    omission,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(iii)  that
    the act or omission was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(iv)  that,
    having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would
    be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b)     the day on which a reasonable
    person with the abilities and in the circumstances of the person with the claim
    first ought to have known of the matters referred to in clause (a).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    5(2) creates a presumption that a claimant acquired knowledge of his or her
    claim on the date the act or omission on which the claim is based took place. 
    In this case, by reason of s. 5(2), in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
    Mr. Miaskowski was presumed to have discovered the material facts on which his
    claim against Mr. Catney Sr. was based on the day that the accident took place: <em>Placzek v. Green</em>, 2009 ONCA 83, 307 D.L.R. (4th) 441, at para. 23. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    this court held in <em>Longo v. MacLaren Art Centre</em>, 2014 ONCA 526, 323
    O.A.C. 246, at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A plaintiff is required to act with due diligence in
    determining if he has a claim.  A limitation period will not be tolled while a
    plaintiff sits idle and takes no steps to investigate the matters referred to
    in s. 5(1)(a) [of the <em>Limitations Act</em>].  While some action must be
    taken, the nature and extent of the required action will depend on all of the
    circumstances of the case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    it is here that the appellants’ challenge to the motions judge’s ruling
    regarding the action against Mr. Catney Sr. founders.  The appellants led no
    evidence in response to Mr. Catney Sr.’s summary judgment motion outlining any
    efforts undertaken by them or on their behalf to determine the identity of the
    tenant at the Property.  Yet Mr. Miaskowski, by his own admission on discovery,
    knew on the date of the accident that the Property was rented.  Similarly, the
    appellants failed to adduce any evidence explaining why Alliance, Mr.
    Miaskowski’s employer, was not sued although Mr. Miaskowski knew it occupied,
    but did not own, the Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    party opposing a summary judgment motion is obliged to put his or her ‘best
    foot’ forward in response to the motion.  Further, under s. 5(2) of the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>, the appellants bore the onus of leading evidence to displace the
    statutory presumption of the date on which they discovered their claim against
    Mr. Catney Sr.  They failed to do so.  Consequently, they failed to satisfy their
    obligation to establish why, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, they
    could not have discovered the identity of the actual tenant of the Property
    prior to the expiry of the applicable limitation period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, I agree with the motions judge’s conclusion, at para. 77,
    that the appellants did not meet “the relatively low threshold of showing that
    [they] could not, through reasonable diligence, have discovered [their] claim
    on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based took place”, as
    contemplated under s. 5(2) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    appreciate that the appellants argue that the motions judge erred by finding,
    at paras. 75 and 78, that if normal inquiries had been made by Mr. Miaskowski
    or his lawyers, and if Mr. Catney Jr. and Alliance had been sued at the outset,
    “in relatively short order, [Mr. Miaskowski] would have discovered all of the
    parties, including [Mr. Catney Sr.] should have been defendants to the action”. 
    The appellants submit, in effect, that the motions judge either ignored or
    discounted evidence that Mr. Catney Jr. had falsified the Lease by entering
    into it in his father’s name and by signing his father’s name to the Lease.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, nothing turns on this issue for the purpose of this appeal. 
    Regardless of the arrangements agreed upon by Mr. Catney Sr. and his son
    concerning the contents and execution of the Lease, the appellants led no
    evidence that these arrangements misled or prevented them from discovering the
    identity of the tenant of the Property.  Simply put, there was no evidence
    before the motions judge regarding <em>any</em> efforts by the appellants or
    their counsel to ascertain the identity of the tenant prior to the expiry of
    the limitation period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    even after Mr. Persaud’s lawyer informed the appellants’ counsel, in September
    2009, that Mr. Catney Sr. should be added as a party defendant to the main
    action, the appellants did not join him in the proceeding for almost five and
    one–half months.  This, too, belies any suggestion of reasonable diligence by
    the appellants in attempting to identify the tenant of the Property.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal from the motions judge’s order
    granting summary judgment in favour of Mr. Catney Sr. and dismissing the action
    as against him. </p>
  <p class=Heading>III.      The Persaud Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reach a different conclusion, however, regarding the appellants’ appeal from
    the summary judgment granted to Mr. Persaud.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, Mr. Miaskowski claims that Mr. Persaud, either as an occupier or
    as the owner of the Property, breached his duties under the <em>OLA</em> and at
    common law to take reasonable care to ensure that the Property was reasonably
    safe for use and clear of ice and snow.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    framed, these claims engage the interplay between the provisions of the <em>OLA</em> and the statutory duties imposed on landlords and tenants under the <em>Residential
    Tenancies Act, 2006</em>, S.O. 2006, c. 17 (the “<em>RTA</em>”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the <em>OLA</em>, the appellants’ claims against Mr. Persaud implicate
    ss. 1, 3, 6, 8 and 9 of the <em>OLA</em>, among other provisions of that
    statute.   Section 1 defines the term “occupier”.  Section 3(1) provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>An occupier of premises owes a duty to take such care as in all
    the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that persons entering on the
    premises, and the property brought on the premises by those persons are
    reasonably safe while on the premises.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 6 of the <em>OLA</em>, an occupier may avoid liability for damage caused by
    the negligence of an independent contractor employed by the occupier, in
    certain circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    8 of the <em>OLA</em> sets out the obligations of a landlord in respect of
    rented premises where the landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair
    of the premises.  Section 8(1) reads:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Where premises are occupied or used by virtue of a tenancy
    under which the landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair of the
    premises, it is the duty of the landlord to show towards any person or the
    property brought on the premises by those persons, the same duty of care in
    respect of dangers arising from any failure on the landlord’s part in carrying
    out the landlord’s responsibility as is required by this Act to be shown by an
    occupier of the premises.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    s. 9 of the <em>OLA</em> provides that nothing in the statute relieves an
    occupier from “any higher liability or any duty to show a higher standard of
    care” arising from “any enactment or rule of law imposing special liability or
    standards of care” on landlords, amongst others.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    by reason of s. 9 of the <em>OLA</em>, the duties imposed on landlords under
    the <em>RTA</em> and associated regulations are also in play, in addition to
    those provisions of the <em>OLA </em>that impose duties on occupiers or
    landlords of property.  Section 20(1) of the <em>RTA</em> stipulates:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a
    residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of
    repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing
    and maintenance standards.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    s. 26(1) of O. Reg. 517/06, enacted under the <em>RTA</em> and entitled
    “Maintenance Standards” (the “Regulation”), states:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Exterior common areas shall be maintained in a condition
    suitable for their intended use and free of hazards and, for these purposes,
    the following shall be removed</em>:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>1.   Noxious
    weeds as defined in the regulations to the <em>Weed Control Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>2.   Dead,
    decayed or damaged trees or parts of such trees that create an unsafe
    condition.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>3.   Rubbish
    or debris, including abandoned motor vehicles.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>4.   Structures
    that create an unsafe condition.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>5.  <em>Unsafe
    accumulations of ice and snow</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge concluded that Mr. Miaskowski’s claims against Mr. Persaud,
    including those involving issues related to the application of the relevant
    provisions of the <em>OLA</em> and the <em>RTA</em>, were appropriate for and
    capable of resolution by means of summary judgment.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so concluding, the motions judge considered various pertinent statutory
    provisions and several decisions of this court regarding the <em>OLA</em> and a
    predecessor statute to the <em>RTA</em>.  Having done so, he held that there
    was no genuine issue requiring a trial because: i) Mr. Persaud was not an
    “occupier” within the meaning of the <em>OLA</em> and was not liable under s. 8
    of the <em>OLA</em>; ii) no specific provision of the <em>RTA</em> was
    inconsistent with the terms of the Lease; iii) no breach of Mr. Persaud’s
    obligations as a landlord under s. 20 of the <em>RTA</em> had been
    demonstrated; and iv) since the <em>OLA</em> supersedes common law liability for
    occupiers, and Mr. Persaud was not an occupier, there was no basis for any
    finding of liability in negligence at common law against Mr. Persaud.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge, therefore, granted summary judgment in favour of Mr. Persaud and
    dismissed the action as against him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, it is my view that, on the record before him, the motions judge erred
    in granting Mr. Persaud’s summary judgment motion.  Even assuming that the
    claims advanced against Mr. Persaud were appropriate for resolution by means of
    summary judgment, I do not agree that no genuine issue requiring a trial arises
    in respect of those claims.  I say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ action against Mr. Persaud requires consideration of the scope and
    effect of the tenant’s obligations under the Lease, the landlord’s and the tenant’s
    obligations under the <em>RTA</em> and associated regulations, and the nature
    of Mr. Persaud’s duties under the <em>OLA</em>, in respect of the Property. 
    This, in turn, necessitates consideration of the interrelationship between the <em>RTA</em> and the <em>OLA</em>.  In my opinion, the motions judge failed to address
    several key aspects of this amalgam of relevant considerations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants argue that Mr. Persaud was bound by a continuing maintenance
    obligation in respect of the Property under s. 20(1) of the <em>RTA</em> and s.
    26(1) of the Regulation.  Section 26(1) of the Regulation imposes obligations
    on residential landlords to maintain “exterior common areas” and to remove
    unsafe accumulations of ice and snow, among other matters.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit that, as the Property was a single-family home, s.&nbsp;26(1)
    of the Regulation does not apply as the driveway at the Property was not an “exterior
    common area”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge held that no “specific provision” of the <em>RTA</em> was
    inconsistent with the terms of the Lease.  However, based on his reasons, it is
    unclear that he considered whether the maintenance standards imposed by s.&nbsp;26(1)
    of the Regulation applied in this case and whether the landlord’s statutory
    duty under s.&nbsp;20(1) of the <em>RTA</em> could be removed by the Lease, in
    particular, in light of this court’s decisions in <em>Montgomery v. Van</em>,
    2009 ONCA 808, 256 O.A.C. 202 and <em>Taylor v. Allen</em>, 2010 ONCA 596, 325
    D.L.R. (4th) 761.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    failing to address these matters, the motions judge erred in principle.  Whether
    Mr. Persaud was freed of any obligations he might have under s. 20(1) of the <em>RTA</em> by reason of the Lease, and whether the maintenance standards set out in s.
    26(1) of the Regulation apply in this case, are genuine issues requiring a trial.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the scope of the tenant’s snow and ice removal obligation under Schedule “A” to
    the Lease and the landlord’s obligations under s. 8 of the <em>OLA</em> are
    central issues in relation to the appellants’ claims against Mr. Persaud. 
    While the motions judge referred to the tenant’s maintenance obligation under
    Schedule “A” to the Lease, he failed to address the pivotal language in the
    Schedule, which refers only to snow and ice on the sidewalks in front and at
    the sides of the Property, and not to hazards <em>on the driveway</em> where
    the accident occurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    scope of the tenant’s maintenance obligation under Schedule “A” to the Lease is
    critical to the issue of Mr. Persaud’s potential liability under s.&nbsp;8 of
    the <em>OLA</em>.  As this court explained in <em>Taylor</em>, at para. 12:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Second 8(1) imposes a duty of care on the landlord to any
    person coming on to the property where the premises are occupied under a
    tenancy in which the landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair of
    the property.  <em>This section applies whether or not the landlord is found to
    be an occupier</em>.  Section 8(2) adds a second requirement, namely, that only
    if the landlord’s default is such as to be actionable at the suit of the tenant
    will the landlord’s default constitute a breach of the landlord’s duty under s.
    8(1).  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the question whether the tenant was responsible under the Lease for removal of
    snow and ice hazards on the driveway of the Property, as opposed to the
    sidewalks, is integral to the issue of the landlord’s potential liability under
    s. 8 of the <em>OLA</em> regardless of whether the landlord was an occupier of
    the Property.  In these circumstances, the scope of the tenant’s maintenance obligation
    under the Lease is a genuine issue requiring a trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the <em>RTA</em> imposes specific responsibilities on tenants of residential
    properties in some circumstances.  Section 33 of the <em>RTA</em>, for example,
    provides that tenants are responsible for the ordinary cleanliness of their
    rental unit, except to the extent that the applicable tenancy agreement
    requires the landlord to clean it.  It is arguable that, in this case, as in <em>Estey
    v. Sannio Construction Co</em>. (1998), 70 O.T.C. 293 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), s.
    33 of the <em>RTA</em> imposes an obligation on the tenant to remove snow.  That
    said, I note that, in <em>Estey</em>, this finding rested in part on evidence that
    the tenant had removed snow and ice from the rented property in the past and
    believed that it was the tenant’s obligation to do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, neither the parties nor the motions judge addressed the potential
    application of those provisions of the <em>RTA</em> that deal with tenants’ responsibilities
    in relation to residential properties in light of the terms of the Lease, the
    intentions of the parties and any evidence about who, in fact, removed snow
    from the driveway at the Property.  In these circumstances, whether the tenant,
    rather than the landlord, had contractual or statutory responsibility for the
    removal of snow and ice <em>on the driveway</em> of the Property is a genuine
    issue requiring a trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, I would allow the appeal from the motions judge’s order
    granting summary judgment in favour of Mr. Persaud and dismissing the action as
    against him, set aside his order dated March 12, 2015 regarding Mr. Persaud,
    and reinstate the action as against him.</p>
  <p class=Heading>IV.     Costs</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, Mr. Catney Sr., is entitled to the costs of the Catney appeal,
    while the appellants are entitled to the costs of the Persaud appeal.  I would
    fix Mr. Catney’s costs in the amount of $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and
    all applicable taxes, as agreed by the parties.  I would fix the appellants’
    costs of the Persaud appeal in the amount of $10,000, inclusive of
    disbursements and all applicable taxes, also as agreed by the parties.</p>
