  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of child luring contrary to
    s.&nbsp;172.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He received a conditional sentence
    of two years less a day. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal the conditional sentence. If leave is
    granted, it asks that the appeal be allowed and a custodial term imposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would grant leave, allow the appeal, and
    order the appellant incarcerated for the time remaining on his conditional
    sentence.</p>
  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between April and December 2009, the respondent engaged in sexually
    explicit Internet chats with a 12-year-old girl, E.F., who lived in the south
    western United States. He instructed her on sexual activities, sent her
    photographs of his penis, induced her to send him nude photographs of herself,
    and had lengthy chats with her, requesting that she masturbate at the same time
    as he did. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent met E.F. through an Internet tennis game. He used a false
    name and told her he was 22 years old. In fact, he was 24. She initially told
    him she was 18. In fact, she was 12.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They began communicating by email and instant messenger. The respondent asked
    E.F. about her sexual experiences. From her relative ignorance of sexual
    matters, he suspected that she was younger than 18.  He pressed her for
    details. She admitted she was only 12. This was in June, a month or two after
    they began communicating.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With knowledge that E.F. was 12, the respondent continued his sexually
    explicit communications for another five months. He escalated from chatting, to
    sending photos of his erect penis, to suggesting sexual acts for her to engage
    in, to asking for and receiving nude photographs of her body, including
    close-ups of her vagina. He engaged in lengthy sexual chats with her while he
    masturbated, requesting that she do so at the same time. He instructed her on
    how to perform oral sex on a banana and she sent him photographs of herself
    doing so. He instructed her on inserting objects into her vagina.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.F. sent the respondent at least 38 nude photographs of herself. Some
    contained close-ups of her vagina, posed according to his directions. When she
    expressed reluctance about sending more, he told her that another girl was
    willing to send him photographs if she did not.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent clearly realized that what he was doing was wrong. At one
    point, he suggested E.F. could say she was 18 in their chats. She declined to
    do so, protesting that she was 12 years old, not 18.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually,
    E.F. stopped communicating. Her parents discovered what had been taking place.
    In December, they reported the offence to police, who interviewed E.F. The
    communications were traced to a computer in the respondent’s home in
    Scarborough, Ontario. Police arrested him. They found his emails and chats with
    E.F. on his computer. They also found a number of pornographic photographs of E.F.,
    hidden on his computer in a folder named “E.”. They also found five child
    pornography videos on his computer, none of which involved E.F. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of sentencing, the respondent admitted the possession of the
    photographs of the victim, although he did not plead to the count of possession
    of child pornography. He testified that he was not aware of the child
    pornography videos on his computer, which he thought might have been
    inadvertently downloaded with other pornographic videos. The sentencing judge
    accepted this explanation.</p>
  <h1><span lang=X-NONE>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=X-NONE>The sentencing Judge’s Reasons</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge identified the sentencing principles set out in ss. 718, 718.1
    and 718.2 of the <em>Code</em> and noted the specific principles applicable to
    cases such as this, set out by this court in <em>R. v. Woodward</em>, 2011 ONCA
    610, 107 O.R. (3d) 81. There, this court stated, at para. 76, that the focus of
    the hearing should be on “the harm caused to the child by the offender’s
    conduct and the life-altering consequences that can and often do flow from it.”
    This court went on to say that while the effects of the sentence on the
    offender, and the prospects for rehabilitation warrant consideration, “the
    objectives of denunciation and deterrence, and the need to separate sexual
    predators from society for society’s well-being and the well-being of our children
    must take precedence.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge also accepted that, in the absence of “exceptional
    circumstances”, a conviction for Internet luring will normally require a period
    of significant incarceration, and that this principle should be departed from
    only in the “rarest of cases.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    considered the following factors aggravating: (a) the presence of an actual
    victim (as opposed to a police officer) and the suffering of the victim and her
    family; (b) the victim was 12-years old, bringing the case within the most
    serious luring charge; (c) the prolonged nature of the conduct, 6 to 7 months;
    and (d) the accused was a healthy 24-year-old manipulating a 12-year-old girl.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following factors were mitigating: (a) a guilty plea, saving the victim from
    testifying; (b) the absence of a criminal record; (c) a supportive family; (d)
    a lengthy period on bail; (e) submitting to a psychiatric assessment and
    counselling; (f) a low risk of re-offending; and (g) genuine remorse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.F.’s
    mother filed a victim impact statement. E.F. herself did not wish to do so. The
    sentencing judge had no doubt about the sincerity of the mother’s belief about
    the effect of the crime on her daughter, and no doubt that the accused’s
    conduct had impacted E.F. However, without a professional assessment, she
    viewed the mother’s opinion “with caution”. Although E.F. was in counselling,
    there was no report from her counsellor. There was no evidence that her
    academic progress had been affected and no evidence that her social life had
    changed. Although her mother believed that E.F. was “depressed”, the sentencing
    judge was unable to determine if this was clinical and related to the abuse or
    “typical ‘teenage’ angst.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge concluded that there was some negative impact on the victim,
    but not of such a degree as to be “life-altering”, as described in <em>Woodward</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent had very strong rehabilitative prospects. He pleaded guilty, showed
    sincere remorse, and spared the victim from testifying. He had no criminal
    record. He had a strong employment history. He had strong family support. He received
    counselling. An expert psychiatric report established that he was not a
    paedophile and was at negligible risk of committing future offences. The
    respondent had never attempted to meet the victim. The expert testified that
    someone who has already arranged a meeting is a higher risk than someone who has
    not. The expert testified that the respondent was a very good candidate for
    counselling. The respondent spent about four months under restrictive bail
    prior to sentencing, and four additional months on bail with a curfew.</p>

    sentencing judge accepted the expert evidence that the respondent was not a paedophile
    and found that while he was emotionally immature, there were good prospects for
    counselling. He was a naïve man who exercised poor judgment. He had shown
    insight into his crimes, remorse, empathy and motivation not to let it happen
    again.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge concluded that this was one of the “rarest of cases” in which
    a conditional sentence was appropriate. She therefore sentenced the respondent to
    a sentence of two years less a day, with 12 months of house arrest (except
    while travelling to or from or at his place of employment), followed by a
    12-month curfew and 100 hours of community service. </p>

    is well-settled that absent an error in principle, failure to consider a

    play in the sentencing process, particularly those of the victim, offender and
    community. This court observed in <em>Ramage</em>, at paras. 72-73, that the
    sentencing judge is in the best position to gauge the interests of the
    community when assessing if a conditional sentence could meet the needs of
    general deterrence and denunciation.</p>

    No minimum sentence was in place during the time of the offence at issue. Had
    one been, the respondent would not have been entitled to a conditional

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In <em>R. v. Folino</em> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 641, this
    court stated that the offence of child luring must be dealt with seriously to
    protect vulnerable children from predators who use the Internet to lure them
    into situations in which they can be exploited and abused. The sentencing
    objectives of denunciation and deterrence require a sentence of incarceration
    in most cases. A conditional sentence will only be appropriate in the “rarest
    of cases”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I acknowledge the sentencing judge’s appropriate concern for the rehabilitation
    of a naïve and immature offender, it is my respectful view that a conditional
    sentence was unfit in the circumstances of this case. That sentence did not
    give adequate expression to denunciation and deterrence. Nor did it give
    adequate consideration to the impact of the offence on the victim. It  also
    ignored aggravating factors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will begin by identifying the aggravating factors that should have been
    considered. I will then address the impact of the offence on the victim,
    distinguish this case from others in which a conditional sentence was imposed for
    child luring, and, finally, explain why denunciation and deterrence call for a
    sentence of incarceration.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Failure to consider aggravating factors  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her analysis of the appropriate sentence, the sentencing judge failed to take
    into account that, in the course of committing the offence of child luring, the
    respondent repeatedly and successfully urged the victim to make and distribute
    child pornography by sending naked images of herself to him, an offence under
    s. 163.1 of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the respondent did not plead guilty to distribution or possession of child
    pornography, it was agreed that the court could consider the child pornography
    as part of the circumstances of the offence. The child pornography offence featured
    a mandatory minimum sentence. A conviction for that offence would have
    precluded the respondent’s conditional sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made no reference to the production of child pornography in her
    analysis of aggravating factors. The exploitation of the victim to produce
    made-to-order child pornography, for his own sexual gratification, was a
    significant aggravating factor: see <em>R. v. Jarvis</em> (2006), 211 C.C.C.
    (3d) 20 (C.A.), at para. 31; <em>R. v. R.B</em>., 2014 ONCA 840, 327 O.A.C. 20,
    at para. 10. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the victim supplied nude photographs of herself to the respondent, he was able
    to manipulate her to continue to supply more. I agree with the observation in <em>R.
    v. Hajar</em>, 2014 ABQB 550 at para. 18, that “[t]he potential for such images
    to be shared with others may, even in the absence of any extortion by the
    offender, make the young victim more sexually compliant in an attempt to
    maintain some indirect control over the images, thus encouraging what appears
    to be <em>de facto</em> consent.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was also aggravating that the <span style='line-height:200%'>respondent groomed
    his child victim by cultivating her trust, steering the conversations towards
    sexual topics, and schooling her about sexual matters. </span>It may have been
    a fortunate circumstance of geography that the appellant did not attempt to
    meet with the victim, precluding his interference from escalating to direct
    physical contact. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Inadequate consideration for impact on

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offence has had, and likely will have, a significant impact on the victim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
    in her analysis, the sentencing judge identified the principle applicable to
    cases such as this, set out by this court in <em>Woodward</em>, to the effect
    that the focus of the hearing should be on the harm caused to the child.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s victim impact statement stated that E.F. refused to complete the
    child/youth victim impact statement. Victim impact statements may be completed
    by family members where the victim is dead, ill or incapable of making a
    statement: s. 722(2)(d). In this case, the defence did not object to the
    introduction of the mother’s victim impact statement. Nor did the defence
    dispute that the harm identified in the mother’s statement was referable to the
    abuse by the respondent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.F.’s
    mother described her daughter as having become “a very guarded, quiet, reserved
    stand-offish, distant and depressed young lady of 16 years” and said this had
    changed the entire family dynamic. E.F. no longer had a relationship with her
    sister. Her sister had shut her out of her life, refused to acknowledge E.F. as
    her sister, and found her “gross”, “stupid” and “disgusting”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother wrote that E.F. refused to talk to her family about anything in her
    life. This made it difficult to explain her conduct to relatives, without
    telling them the truth about why “E.F. acts like she does.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s statement continued:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although she has told us she was relieved when we discovered
    what was going [on] because it immediately put a stop to the control he had
    over her and the manipulation he had over her, she states she feels she can’t
    trust us or talk to us any longer since this all took place. She has been going
    to counselling for the past 4 years because of this and we still feel she is
    not over it, it is still present in her life and seems to dictate who she has
    become, which is so very sad for a beautiful young lady who has so much
    potential. We wonder if she will ever heal, find closure, be able to accept
    what happened, put it behind her and move on with her life in a healthy, happy,
    positive way.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>We believe her innocence, her childhood and her ability to love
    and be loved have been stripped away because of the horrific relationship she
    had with Rafiq.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s statement makes it clear that, in her view, the victim’s
    self-exclusion from her family was directly attributable to the actions of the
    respondent, and not the result of teenage angst.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s evidence aside, in <em>R. v. D.D.</em> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788
    (C.A.), at paras. 37-38, this court noted that the tragic consequences of the
    exploitation of young children by adult sexual predators include the following:
    immediate physical and psychological harm, the inability to form a loving
    caring relationship as an adult, and a proclivity to themselves becoming
    abusers as adults. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>D.D.,</em> this court referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal of
    Alberta in <em>R. v. S. (W.B.)</em> and <em>R. v. P. (M.)</em> (1992), 73
    C.C.C. (3d) 530, at p. 535, in which that court observed:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>One consequence of being abused sexually may be that the child
    will never be able, as an adult, to form a loving caring relationship with
    another [adult] being always fearful, even unconsciously, that such a partner
    will use sexual acts to hurt him or her rather than as an intimate expression
    of caring and affection. There is no empirical way of proving that a particular
    child victim’s emotional trauma will or will not make it more difficult or
    impossible for him or her to love another, without fear of abuse. We have only
    the recorded experiences of men and women who attribute their difficulties as
    adults in forming mature and fulfilling relationships to their having been
    abused sexually when they were children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    these observations were made in the context of direct physical sexual abuse,
    the Internet has made it possible for abusers to get into the victim’s head and
    abuse remotely. The abuser can tell the victim what to do and how to do it, and
    record it – in text, video, or photograph – all for the abuser’s gratification.
    Thus, through manipulation and control over time by an adult abuser, the child
    victim becomes a participant in her own sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no reason to believe that the psychological consequences of such abuse are
    likely to be significantly less serious than the consequences of direct
    physical sexual abuse. The extent to which they will occur in any particular
    victim is impossible to predict. In this case, however, the mother had the
    advantage of observing her daughter over a four-year period. She spoke
    poignantly about her isolation from her sister and her family, and the impact
    of the events on her “ability to love and be loved.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it was an error to discount the impact of the offence on the victim. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Conditional sentences for child luring</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prolonged abuse of an actual, very young girl distinguishes this case from
    others in which this court has imposed conditional sentences: see e.g. <em>R.
    v. Folino</em>; <em>R. v. El-Jamel</em>, 2010 ONCA 575, 261 C.C.C. (3d) 293. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Folino</em>, the “victim” was an undercover police officer posing as a
    13-year-old girl. The offence took place over a 19-day period, and involved six
    Internet chats and eight emails. In <em>El-Jamel</em>, the appellant had
    sexually explicit chats with a police officer, believing she was 12 years old.
    The offence took place over a three-day period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, this case involved a real victim – someone the respondent knew to be
    a naïve 12 year-old girl. He induced her to make and transmit pornographic
    pictures, insert items in her vagina, masturbate and participate in sexually
    explicit chats – all for his sexual gratification. He did this repeatedly, over
    a span of six months. In my view, his conduct was far more harmful than
    arranging a sexual encounter with an adult police officer believing she was a
    child. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=X-NONE>Denunciation and deterrence</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Crown’s submission that the objectives of denunciation and
    deterrence require a custodial sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    appreciate that following a guilty plea, and in the absence of the victim, the
    sentencing hearing understandably focussed on the offender. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    a conditional sentence was not an appropriate outcome. I say this despite the
    respondent’s youth, remorse, prospects for rehabilitation and absence of threat
    to society. A custodial sentence is required to denounce his conduct and to
    make it clear to those who would use the Internet to abuse young children that
    such conduct has serious punitive consequences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    many of the child luring cases that come before the court, the respondent’s
    conduct was not simply preparatory to a crime, but amounted to distinct serious
    offences repeatedly committed on a 12 year-old child over a prolonged period of
    time. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arguably,
    the most recent amendment to this offence imposing a mandatory minimum sentence
    for luring should require the appropriate range of sentences to be revised
    upward even further: see e.g. <em>Woodward</em>, at para. 58. </p>
