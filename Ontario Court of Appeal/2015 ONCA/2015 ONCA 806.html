    Patterson of the Superior Court of Justice, dated March 19, 2014.</p>
  <p class=Heading><strong>Epstein J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Late in the afternoon on New Year’s Eve 2001, the
    appellant, Janice Martin-Vandenhende, left her place of work and drove her Toyota
    Camry south on Erie Street, a two-lane roadway in the town of Ridgetown.  The
    respondents, Peter Myslik and his father, Edward Myslik, were behind her in a GM
    pickup truck.  Peter Myslik was driving.  His father was in the passenger seat.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Martin-Vandenhende realized she had left something
    behind.  She decided to turn left into a private driveway to turn around and go
    back to work to retrieve the item.  As she started the turn, the Myslik vehicle
    came up from behind and collided with the left side of the back of her car.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Martin-Vandenhende was injured and taken to
    hospital.  No charges were laid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The amount of damages has been settled. 
    Liability remains in issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During the 14 years since the accident, two
    trials have taken place to determine responsibility for the collision.  The
    first trial judge, Thomas J., held that Peter Myslik was 100 percent at fault. The
    Mysliks appealed.  The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The second
    trial judge, Patterson J., apportioned 50 percent liability to both parties.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Martin-Vandenhende appeals.  She asks this
    court to overturn the trial judge’s finding of contributory negligence against
    her on the grounds that she neither breached the standard of care nor caused
    the accident.   Alternatively, Ms. Martin-Vandenhende seeks to reduce her
    degree of responsibility to between five to ten percent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based on the following analysis, I would allow
    the appeal.  I would set aside the judgment and hold Peter Myslik 90 percent
    responsible for the collision and Ms. Martin-Vandenhende 10 percent responsible.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE COLLISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The posted speed limit on Erie Street where the
    accident took place was 60 k.p.h.  Each of the two paved lanes was just over 11
    feet wide. There was evidence that at the location where the collision took
    place, the gravel shoulder was approximately two to three feet wide and sloped
    sharply away from the road. The centre line was a single solid yellow line.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Driving conditions were not good. It was snowing
    heavily on the day of the accident.  The roads were slippery. Snow was blowing,
    impairing visibility. The centre line could not be seen, although the shoulder
    remained discernible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence differed as to the circumstances
    surrounding the collision.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Martin-Vandenhende’s evidence was that due
    to the weather and road conditions, she was traveling below the speed limit. Since
    she could not see the centre line, she was driving on the right side of the lane
    so she could use the shoulder to help her determine her position on the road.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Martin-Vandenhende described her actions after
    identifying the driveway where she could turn around, as follows.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She applied her brakes, reduced her speed to
    approximately 20 to 30 k.p.h., and activated her left-turn signal approximately
    75 feet before the accident site.  She then started to make a gradual left turn.
    Ms. Martin-Vandenhende testified that she could not recall whether, before the
    impact, she looked in her mirrors or checked her blind spot to determine whether
    there was any traffic approaching from behind.  Her evidence was that because
    of the weather conditions, she was focusing on the driveway and what was ahead.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to Ms. Martin-Vandenhende, as she
    angled her car left toward the centre line, the back of her car was hit by
    another vehicle.  When the accident took place, the front of her car was near,
    but not over, the centre line of Erie Street. The impact of the collision was
    severe.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Peter Myslik testified that as he was driving
    southbound on Erie Street, he saw a Camry about 200 to 300 yards ahead.  He was
    driving about 50 to 60 k.p.h. and was catching up to it.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the Mysliks, when the two vehicles were
    about 100 yards apart, the driver of the Camry signaled right and moved to the right
    shoulder. The Camry slowed down to the point of almost stopping. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Peter Myslik testified that based on the
    movement of the Camry, he concluded that the driver intended to let him pass. 
    He therefore decided to go out and around the car, to the left. However, when he
    was about 60 to 90 feet behind the Camry, and while the right turn signal of
    the car remained activated, the driver of the Camry turned left, directly into
    his path.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Peter Myslik braked hard and attempted to steer the
    pickup truck toward the right but was unable to avoid a collision. The front left
    corner of the pickup hit the back left corner of the Camry. The Camry spun
    around and landed in the ditch on the east side of the roadway.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Peter Myslik agreed that he did nothing to warn the
    driver ahead that he intended to pass, such as honk his horn or activate his
    left-turn signal.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:none'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Both Peter and Edward Myslik testified that before the collision,
    the farthest left the pickup truck traveled in the southbound lane was that its
    left wheels were somewhere close to the centre line.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his brief reasons, the trial judge first reviewed
    the parties’ evidence concerning the circumstances leading up to the collision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He acknowledged the testimony of accident
    reconstruction and perception reaction time experts, but found, at para. 21,
    that they “could not assist in determining how the accident took place having
    regard to the conflicting evidence of the parties.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then relied on <em>Beaumont v.
    Ruddy</em>, [1932] O.R. 441 (C.A.), in which this court observed that
    generally, in a rear-end collision, the rear driver is at fault and must prove
    that his or her negligence did not cause the collision. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also noted two sections of the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (the “<em>HTA</em>”): s. 158.1, which
    makes it an offence to follow another vehicle too closely, and s. 142(1), which
    provides that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The driver or operator of a vehicle upon a highway before
    turning to the left or right at any intersection or into a private road or
    driveway or from one lane for traffic to another lane for traffic or to leave
    the roadway shall first see that the movement can be made in safety, and if the
    operation of any other vehicle may be affected by the movement shall give a
    signal plainly visible to the driver or operator of the other vehicle of the
    intention to make the movement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the following four paragraphs, the trial
    judge made the findings he considered relevant and determined that Peter Myslik
    and Ms. Martin-Vandenhende were each 50 percent responsible for the collision:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[25] I am not sure whether [Ms. Martin-Vandenhende] signaled to
    turn right but if I accept that she signaled to turn left, in my opinion she
    did so too late, having regard to the weather conditions to turn left safely.
    This is especially so because she did not check to see if anyone was
    approaching from the rear. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[26] I acknowledge that there are two competing issues. Peter
    [Myslik] is required to explain that he was not negligent when he ran into the
    rear of [Ms. Martin-Vandenhende] and [Ms. Martin-Vandenhende] is required to
    explain that she made a left turn safely. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[27] In my opinion both parties are equally responsible for the
    accident with 50 percent liability on each party. Peter Myslik should have been
    in control of his vehicle and because of the snow conditions should have been
    driving less than the speed limit. Further he should have been more cautious
    approaching a vehicle going more slowly than he on the road ahead. As a result
    he is 50 percent negligent regarding the accident. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[28] In regard to Ms. Martin-Vandenhende she slowed up
    significantly below what was less than highway speed on a snowy day, signaled
    too late to make a left turn and did not check in her rear-view mirror before
    she made a left turn to see that she could do so safely. As a result she is 50
    percent negligent regarding the accident.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Mysliks have not cross-appealed the trial
    judge’s finding that Peter Myslik was 50 percent responsible for the accident. 
    The issues in this appeal are therefore as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in finding Ms. Martin-Vandenhende negligent?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If Ms. Martin-Vandenhende was negligent, did the trial judge err in concluding
    that her negligence was causally connected to the accident and in assigning 50
    percent of the responsibility to her?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the trial judge erred in concluding that Ms. Martin-Vandenhende’s
    negligence was causally connected to the accident and in assigning 50 percent
    of the responsibility to her, what is the appropriate remedy?</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the Mysliks relied on two arguments in
    support of their position that Ms. Martin-Vandenhende was negligent and bore
    some of the responsibility for the collision.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Primary Argument – Improper Lane Change</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the Mysliks, the evidence
    demonstrated that before starting her turn, Ms. Martin-Vandenhende veered right
    and pulled onto the right shoulder. Their primary argument was that by jumping
    back into the southbound lane, Ms. Martin-Vandenhende made an unsafe lane
    change. </span></p>

    traffic coming from the rear prior to her making her left turn.” The transcript

    supports a finding that Ms.  Martin-Vandenhende did not check to see if she

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second requirement of s. 142(1) of the <em>HTA </em>is that a driver, before turning, should signal his or her intention if
    another driver may be affected by the movement. There was a conflict in the
    evidence as to whether Ms. Martin-Vandenhende activated her left-turn signal. She
    testified that she did; the Mysliks’ evidence was that they saw no such
    signal.  The trial judge made a finding on this issue.  As can be seen from
    para. 28, he found that she did signal but that she “signaled too late to make
    a left turn”.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is clear that Ms. Martin-Vandenhende did not comply

    did not check that she could turn safely.  But did the requirements of the
    section apply to her given that she remained in the southbound lane at all

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, they did.  In my view, s. 142(1)
    means what it says.  Before turning, a driver must check to see if the turn can
    be done in safety and signal the turn if another vehicle may be affected by the
    movement. I see nothing in the wording of the section that supports the
    limitation Ms. Martin-Vandenhende suggests – that the section only applies in

    in that case were very different.  Among other things, the defendant (the
    driver of the car making the left turn) clearly signaled his intention to
    turn.  Significantly, in the passage set out above upon which Ms.
    Martin-Vandenhende relies, Hudson J. found that the comparable section of the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act</em>, R.S.O. 1937, c. 288, did not apply, not on the basis of a
    limited application of the provision, but on the basis of a finding that the

    “[w]hen [he] became aware that [Ms. Martin-Vandenhende] was turning left in
    front of him”.  He concluded, at para. 28, that Ms. Martin-Vandenhende “did not

    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, is based on the degree to which each party

    fault caused the plaintiff’s loss. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This apportionment is not the product of precise
    calculation.  It comes from a common sense consideration of the facts, including
    the fact that Peter Myslik was driving too fast for the road and weather
    conditions, that he decided to try to pass Ms. Martin-Vandenhende despite, at a
    minimum, being uncertain about her intentions, and that the collision occurred
    entirely within the southbound lane.  For Ms. Martin-Vandenhende’s part, she
    contributed to her loss by failing to conduct herself in accordance with the
    requirements of s. 142(1) of the <em>HTA</em>, thereby depriving both drivers
    of the opportunity to alter their course.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In coming to the conclusion that these
    circumstances support an apportionment of liability that Peter Myslik is 90
    percent responsible for the accident and Ms. Martin-Vandenhende 10 percent
    responsible, I have employed the pragmatism endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em>Clements</em>. 
    In my view, this practical approach is particularly warranted in this case, having
    regard to the resources the parties have expended as they turned to the courts for
    assistance in resolving the issue of liability.   </span></p>
