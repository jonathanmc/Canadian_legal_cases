    6763.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Simmons
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues on this appeal concern whether the respondents are entitled
    to use a laneway located on the appellants’ property to access their homes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, Elaine Gold, Lissa Brown, Robert Fairley and Peter
    Fairley, own homes fronting on Brock Avenue in Toronto. Except on foot – and
    with difficulty – the respondents have no access to their homes from Brock Avenue
    because of an embankment and a fence at the front of their homes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the respondents purchased their homes, their deeds included a right
    of way over a laneway located on adjoining land at the rear of their
    properties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Dianna Chronas and Mark Kane, own the adjoining land, including
    the laneway, at the rear of the respondents’ properties. The appellants’
    property fronts onto Cunningham Avenue and is municipally known as 7 Cunningham
    Avenue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the period from about 1948 to 1960, the deeds in the chain of title
    to 7 Cunningham Avenue stated that the property was subject to a right of way
    over the laneway. From 1960 onward, the deeds in the chain of title to 7
    Cunningham Avenue no longer referred to the right of way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2003, the appellants’ and the respondents’ properties were all
    converted from the land registration system governed by the <em>Registry Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. R.20, to the electronic land registration system governed by
    the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants purchased 7 Cunningham Avenue in 2006. In 2013, they
    blocked the respondents’ access to their homes via the laneway by erecting a
    pole at the entrance to the laneway. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, the respondents applied for an injunction restraining the
    appellants from interfering with the respondents’ use of the laneway. The
    application judge granted the respondents’ application and prohibited the
    appellants from interfering with the use of the rights of way over the laneway as
    described in the respondents’ deeds. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 16 of his reasons, in discussing the respondents’ claim for a
    remedy based on proprietary estoppel, the application judge found the
    appellants’ actions “unconscionable, inequitable and unjust.” However, he left
    for another day the availability of a remedy based on proprietary estoppel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    at para. 23 of his reasons, the application judge concluded, that “[t]he
    combined effect of [s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em>] with the <em>nemo
    dat</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> principle protects the [respondents’] rights to their rights of way despite the
    fact that it is currently unregistered on the servient tenement.”<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument on appeal, the parties agreed that the issue of whether the
    respondents are entitled to use the laneway turns solely on the interpretation
    and application of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    113(5)(a)(iv) is included in Part III of the <em>Registry Act</em>. Part III
    contains the investigation of titles provisions. The appellants rely on the
    investigation of titles provisions to assert that the respondents’ claim to the
    right of way has expired. According to the appellants, that is because the
    respondents did not register a notice of claim against the title to 7
    Cunningham Avenue within 40 years after the right of way was created – which
    they say was required under the investigation of titles provisions contained in
    Part III. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    113(5) of the <em>Registry Act</em> sets out certain exceptions to the
    application of Part III. Section 113(5)(a)(iv), on which the trial judge relied,
    stipulates that Part III does not apply to a claim “<span style='line-height:
200%'>of a person to an unregistered right of way … that the person is openly
    enjoying and using”. The application judge found that the respondents are
    openly using the laneway and that the appellants were aware of that use when
    they purchased their property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the application judge erred in relying on s.
    113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em>. According to them, s. 113(5)(a)(iv)
    applies only to prescriptive easements – that is, easements acquired through
    adverse possession rather than under a registered instrument. According to
    them, a right of way that was once registered, but that has expired because of
    failure to register a notice of claim within 40 years after the right of way
    was created, does not qualify as “an unregistered right of way” within the
    meaning of s. 113(5)(a)(iv). They submit that to hold otherwise would mean that
    a right of way would become frozen in existence as of a Land Titles conversion
    date, regardless of whether it continued to be openly enjoyed and used
    thereafter. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that I will explain, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brock
    Avenue is a street in Toronto that runs generally north and south. The
    respondents own contiguous properties fronting on the west side of Brock Avenue,
    as follows, beginning with the most southerly property and progressing to the
    most northerly property: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lissa Brown owns 78 Brock Avenue (the most southerly property); </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Elaine Gold owns 80 Brock Avenue; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Robert and Peter Fairley own 84 Brock Avenue; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Robert Fairley owns 86 Brock Avenue (the most northerly property).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>There is no property with the address 82 Brock Avenue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cunningham
    Avenue is a street in Toronto that runs generally east and west and that
    intersects Brock Avenue immediately north of Robert Fairley’s property, 86
    Brock Avenue. As noted, the appellants’ property, 7 Cunningham Avenue, is
    located at the rear (to the west) of the respondents’ properties; it fronts
    onto Cunningham Avenue; and it includes the laneway. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    examination of the chain of title to the respondents’ properties reveals that the
    rights of way described in their deeds, and their dates of origin, vary. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    deeds to 78 and 80 Brock Avenue refer to a right of way 7 feet 6 inches wide
    running the length of the laneway abutting lots 78, 80, 84 and 86. The deeds to
    84 Brock Avenue describe a right of way 7 feet 6 inches wide running the length
    of the laneway abutting lots 84 and 86. And the deeds to 86 Brock Avenue
    describe a right of way 7 feet 6 inches wide running the length of the laneway
    abutting lot 86. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reference
    to the rights of way for 78 and 86 Brock Avenue first appeared in 1946;
    references to the rights of way for 80 and 84 Brock Avenue first appeared in
    1948.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question when the right of way over 7 Cunningham Avenue was first created may
    not be entirely clear because the land included in the initial deed that created
    the right of way did not encompass the entire length of the right of way that
    was later created. The chain of title to 7 Cunningham Avenue reveals that a right
    of way over that land was first reserved in a deed registered in 1948; that the
    lands conveyed under that deed did not encompass the entire north-south length
    of the current 7 Cunningham Avenue; and that the right of way is 8 feet 6
    inches wide. A right of way spanning the full length of the current 7
    Cunningham Avenue was referred to in a deed registered in 1954; that deed, too,
    referred to a right of way 8 feet 6 inches wide.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1960, 7 Cunningham Avenue was sold. The 1960 deed did not refer to the servient
    right of way obligation; nor have subsequent deeds and transfers of 7
    Cunningham Avenue referred to that obligation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no evidence presented on the application or on this appeal regarding why
    reference to the right of way disappeared from the title to 7 Cunningham Avenue
    in 1960.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2013, the appellants erected a pole blocking access to the laneway. This act
    led to the current litigation.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the statutory scheme</h1>
  <h2><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span></em>The <em>Registry Act</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, the issue whether the respondents are entitled to use the laneway
    located on 7 Cunningham Avenue turns on the interpretation and application of
    s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em>, which is contained in Part III
    of the <em>Registry Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part
    III of the <em>Registry Act</em> concerns the investigation of titles. It
    provides for a 40-year title search period in s. 112 and for a 40-year expiry
    period in ss. 113(1)-(4). Part III also provides for certain exceptions to its
    application in s. 113(5).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    examining ss. 112 and 113 more closely, I will set out certain definitions
    contained in s. 111, which inform the interpretation of those later provisions:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>111. (1) In this Part,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>“<u>claim” means a right,

    annuity, lease, dower right, and restriction as to the use of land or other
    encumbrance affecting land;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>“<u>notice of claim” means a

    prescribed form</u> and includes a notice registered under a predecessor of
    this Part or under The Investigation of Titles Act, being chapter 193 of the
    Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1960, or a predecessor of it;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>“<u>notice period” means the

  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the application judge’s decision</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the portion of his reasons addressing s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em>,
    the application judge rejected the appellants’ argument that s. 113(5)(a)(iv)
    merely codifies the historic exclusion of prescriptive easements from the 40-year
    search rule. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a starting point, he noted that prescriptive easements are already excluded
    from the 40-year search rule. This is because the definition of claim for the
    purpose of the 40-year search rule is set out is s. 111(1) of Part III of the <em>Registry
    Act</em>, and includes only claims “based upon or arising out of a registered
    instrument”. Claims such as prescriptive easements, which do not arise out of a
    registered instrument, are therefore not claims at all for the purpose of the
    40-year search rule and consequently are outside its ambit. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    113(5)(a)(iv) would thus be unnecessary if it applied only to prescriptive
    easements.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also noted that there is an interpretive question regarding
    whether the respondents are claiming an “unregistered right of way” within the
    meaning of s. 113(5)(a)(iv). This was in dispute because the right of way had
    been registered on the title to the servient tenement, albeit outside the
    40-year search period, and continued to be referred to in the deeds and
    transfers of the respondents’ properties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citing
    Jeffrey W. Lem’s annotation to the Superior Court decision in <em>Ramsay</em>,<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></a></span> the application judge noted, at paras. 21 and 22 of his decision, that the 40-year
    rule would not cause unregistered interests to expire, so s. 113(5)(a)(iv) must
    apply to easements that had been registered at one time and that were then
    openly enjoyed and used at the time of the dispute: “The subclause precisely
    fits the case where an easement or right of way existed once in a registered
    deed and is still used although it may not exist any longer.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acknowledging
    the argument that this approach might undermine the absolute certainty of the
    register, the application judge noted that the existence of prescriptive title
    and the doctrine of actual notice both do so as well. In the application judge’s
    view, s. 113(5)(a)(iv) promotes both fairness and certainty, for a purchaser is
    far likelier “to see an open use than to understand an arcanely drafted point
    buried in a metes and bounds description registered on title.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his reasons, the application judge concluded, at paras. 11 and
    13, that the laneway has been openly enjoyed and used by the respondents
    throughout their periods of ownership of the dominant tenements:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The [appellants] do not deny the evidence of each of the [respondents]
    that each of them has used the laneway for access to their properties and,
    significantly, in all but one case, for tenants to obtain access to leased
    premises in the properties throughout their ownership (Gold from 2009, Brown
    from 2003, and Fairley from 2001).</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As is dealt with below, subclause 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry
    Act</em>, does require a finding that the [respondents] are openly enjoying and
    using the right of way. As noted above however, the [appellants] do not deny
    the [respondents’] evidence concerning their present use of the laneway.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge granted the respondents’ application and made an order
    prohibiting the appellants from interfering with the respondents’ use of the rights
    of way over the laneway as described in their deeds.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, in oral argument the parties agreed that the only issue on appeal
    is the correct interpretation of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em>.
    Proprietary estoppel, prescriptive easements and the <em>nemo dat</em> principle are not at issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants assert that s. 113(5)(a)(iv) applies only to prescriptive easements.
    In their view, the intent of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) is to deal with prescriptive
    rights that have crystalized and to ensure that those rights are not in some
    way eliminated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also assert that the respondents’ rights of way do not fall within
    the ambit of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) because this section applies to an “unregistered right
    of way, easement or other right”. In the appellants’ view, the word
    “unregistered” means <span class=Underline>never</span> registered, and thus s.
    113(5)(a)(iv) does not apply to rights of way, like the respondents’, that were
    once registered on the servient tenement but have not been properly renewed
    within the 40-year expiry period. Moreover, to hold otherwise would mean that a
    right of way would become frozen in existence as of a Land Titles conversion
    date. This is because the <em>Registry Act</em> requirements would no longer
    apply. Accordingly, the right of way would continue to exist regardless of
    whether it continued to be openly enjoyed and used thereafter. The appellants
    assert that cannot have been the Legislature’s intention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents argue that s. 113(5)(a)(iv) does not apply only to prescriptive
    easements. In their view, the intent of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) is to ensure that, in
    the rare circumstances where a past registered right is not validly renewed for
    some reason yet the usage still openly continues, no danger exists that an
    existing right will be lost unfairly through the operation of Part III of the <em>Registry
    Act</em>.</p>
  <h1>F.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Legislative history of Part iii of the <em>Registry Act</em></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I will explain, the 40-year title search period and the 40-year expiry period
    provisions of Part III have been amended on several occasions. The legislative
    history of these provisions is important because they are the provisions to
    which s. 113(5) provides exceptions. The amendments demonstrate a consistent
    intention on the part of the Legislature, from at least 1981 onward, to attempt
    to confine, as far as is reasonably possible, the 40-year search period to 40
    years, and to attempt to limit the manner in which a claim can be renewed to
    the registration of a notice of claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    the 40-year title search period and the 40-year expiry period provisions, the
    language of the exception now contained in s. 113(5)(a)(iv) has remained
    relatively unchanged. Notably, however, the opening words of the exception
    provision have been amended so that the exceptions it contains, which
    originally applied only to the 40-year expiry period, now apply to Part III of
    the <em>Registry Act</em>. Section 113(5)(a)(iv) is therefore an exception, not
    only to the 40-year expiry period, but also to the 40-year title search period.
    Where s. 113(5)(a)(iv) applies, a right will not expire after 40 years. And an
    instrument registered outside the 40-year title search period will continue to
    affect the chain of title.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    this case, <em>Ramsay</em> presented an issue concerning how rights of way can
    be preserved under Part III of the <em>Registry Act</em>. Unlike this case, in <em>Ramsay</em>,
    after the right of way was created, each conveyance of the servient tenement
    stated that the new owner of the servient tenement took title subject to a
    right of way in favour of the owners of the dominant tenements. After the
    40-year expiry period ended, the then-owner of the servient tenement sought a
    declaration that the dominant tenement owners’ claims to a right of way had
    expired. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Ramsay</em>, Lang J.A. observed that the <em>Investigation of Titles Act</em><i>,

    became Part III of the <i>Registry Act</i> by virtue of the <em>Registry
    Amendment Act, 1966</em>, S.O. 1966, c. 136 (the “1966 Act”). Further, she said
    Part III remained relatively unchanged until the <em>Registry Amendment Act,
    1981</em>, S.O. 1981, c. 17 (the “1981 Amendments”). </p>

    the title search period, Lang J.A. observed that, although both the 1929 Act

    practitioners continued to search for a root of title before that period: <em>Ramsay</em>,
    at para. 16, citing <em>Ontario Hydro v. Tkach</em> (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 257

    registered easement could still be preserved not only by registering on the
    servient tenement a notice of claim in the prescribed form but also by
    registering a deed referencing the right of way. This was largely because the
    definition of notice period referred to a period 40 years after the
    registration of <em>an instrument</em> or notice of claim. In the light of this
    conclusion, the court found it unnecessary to address the argument made in that
    case by the owner of the servient tenement that s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry
    Act</em> would preserve an easement that was openly enjoyed and used. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span

    the latter issue, at para. 40, the court commented on the intent of s.
    113(5)(a)(iv) and its requirements. The court also expressed concern whether
    the section could adequately alleviate the unfairness that would result from
    interpreting the 1981 Amendments to mean that a right of way would not be
    preserved even though it was referred to in deeds registered on the servient
    tenement:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>The intent of [s. 113(5)(a)(iv)]</span>,
    however, <span class=Underline>is not clear</span>. It appears that, first, to

    requirement is satisfied, the claimant will be required to establish current
    usage. This combination of traditional easement law with current usage raises
    complex considerations. <span class=Underline>As a result, it is not obvious
    that this provision would alleviate potential unfairness</span>. [Emphasis

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue on appeal is the proper interpretation of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry
    Act</em>. This raises a question of statutory interpretation, which is
    reviewable on a standard of correctness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    second issue involves the application of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) to the facts of this
    case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will begin with the statutory interpretation issue.</p>
  <h2>(1) The interpretation of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    modern approach to statutory interpretation requires that the words of a
    statute be read “in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the
    intention of Parliament”: see <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</em>,
    [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 21, quoting from Elmer Driedger, <em>Construction
    of Statutes</em>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at 87.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    the application judge, I conclude that s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em> can apply to protect a dominant tenement holder’s right to use a right of way
    that was once registered on the servient tenement but the registration of which
    was not validly renewed within 40 years after its creation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, at least while land continues to be governed by the system of land
    registration governed by the<i> <em>Registry Act</em></i>, this protection will
    apply following the expiration of the 40-year expiry period only for so long as
    the right of way continues to be openly enjoyed and used by the owners of the
    dominant tenement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    although the application judge determined that the respondents were openly enjoying
    and using the laneway as of the date of the application, in my view, it was
    also necessary that the respondents show the laneway had been openly enjoyed
    and used following the expiration of the 40-year expiry period (either 1988 or
    1994, depending on when the right of way was first created). I will return to
    this issue below.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    question may exist whether open enjoyment and use must continue after the date
    of Land Titles conversion because the <em>Land Titles Act</em> does not address
    the issue. However, the question does not arise in this case for two reasons.
    First, for reasons set out below, I am satisfied that, for all properties at
    issue, the respondents demonstrated open enjoyment and use to the date of the
    application, which was following the date of Land Titles conversion. Second,
    that interpretive issue was not raised as an issue on appeal.</p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Section 113(5)(a)(iv) can protect
    rights of way that are no longer validly registered</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    the application judge, I reach the conclusion that s. 113(5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry
    Act</em> can apply to protect a dominant tenement holder’s right to use a right
    of way that was once registered on the servient tenement but no longer is
    validly registered largely for the reasons articulated by Jeffrey W. Lem in his
    annotation to the trial decision in <em>Ramsay</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Mr. Lem notes, the concept of prescriptive easements has long been part of the
    common law. Accordingly, if the Legislature had intended s. 113(5)(a)(iv) to
    apply only to prescriptive easements,  it could easily have said so explicitly.
    The Legislature could have done so either by referring specifically to the
    concept – as it did on several occasions in the <em>Land Titles Act</em>, by
    using terms like “possessory”, “prescription”, and “length of possession” in,
    for example, ss. 36(1) and 51(1)<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[14]</span></span></span></a> – or by importing language into s. 113(5)(a)(iv) that mirrors relevant portions
    of the well-established test for prescriptive easements.<a href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[15]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Legislature did neither. Instead, it used the following language: “This Part
    does not apply to … a claim … of a person to an unregistered right of way …
    that the person is <span class=Underline>openly enjoying and using</span>”
    (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as both Mr. Lem and the application judge correctly observed, prescriptive
    easements are not caught by the 40-year title search rule or the 40-year expiry
    rule, which Part III addresses. This is because s. 111(1) limits the definition
    of “claim” for the purposes of those rules to an interest “set forth in, based
    upon or arising out of a registered instrument”. Prescriptive rights are
    neither set forth in, nor based upon, nor do they arise out of registered
    instruments. Thus, if s. 113(5)(a)(iv) were intended to apply only to
    prescriptive rights, it would be redundant. If the 40-year title search rule
    and the 40-year expiry rule do not apply to unregistered prescriptive easements,
    it was unnecessary to enact s. 113(5)(a)(iv)  to preserve them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, it is noteworthy that s. 111(2) expands the definition of “claim”
    for the purposes of s. 113(5)(a)-(b), so that it “is not confined to a claim
    under a registered instrument.” The expanded definition of claim is thus broad
    enough to encompass prescriptive easements. However, it seems unlikely that the
    Legislature would draft an exception to Part III that was intended to apply
    only to the expanded portion of the definition of “claim”, particularly when
    the focus of Part III is on claims arising out of registered instruments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    I agree with Mr. Lem and the application judge that once-registered rights of
    way that are not effectively renewed within the 40-year search period meet the
    definition of “unregistered”. In its plain meaning, the word “unregistered” is
    not synonymous with “never registered.” In my view, on its face, “unregistered”
    right of way also encompasses a right of way that once was, but no longer is,
    effectively registered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to this point, the main focus of Part III of the <em>Registry Act</em> is on claims “set forth in, based upon or arising out of” registered
    instruments, their impact in the chain of title, their expiry and how they can
    be renewed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
    various amendments, the Legislature has attempted to confine, to the extent possible,
    the title search period to 40 years and to eliminate any mechanism for renewing
    a claim, other than by registration of a notice of claim in a prescribed form. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considered
    in that context, it makes sense that the word “unregistered” in a provision
    creating an exception to Part III would encompass claims that were once
    registered but are no longer validly registered. In my view, the purpose of s.
    113(5)(iv) is, at least in part, to preserve, because of particular
    circumstances relating to the claim, a claim that was once registered, but
    which is no longer validly registered. The particular circumstances are the
    fact that the underlying right continues to be openly enjoyed and used. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Ramsay</em>, at para. 46, this court articulated the overall purpose of the <em>Registry Act</em> as seeking to promote commercial certainty; to simplify
    the title search process; and, to this end, to eliminate stale claims. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
    s. 113(5)(iv), the Legislature protects claims that are old, but not stale, in
    a manner that is consistent with the purposes of the <em>Registry Act</em> and
    that is not unfair to purchasers. Even though not validly renewed, the claims
    are not stale because they are still being openly enjoyed and used. And
    protecting such claims does not defeat the purposes of Part III – nor is it
    unfair to purchasers. This is because the enjoyment and use is open. The claims
    are  there to be seen.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    assuming the Legislature intended to reverse the result in <em>Ramsay</em>,
    which held that rights of way could be preserved if referred to in registered
    deeds on the servient tenement, s. 113(5)(iv) is the only mechanism that would
    protect against the manifest unfairness that could accrue to dominant tenement
    owners because of the legislated change in the law. Prior to the 2006
    Amendments, dominant tenement holders may have relied reasonably on references
    to rights of way in deeds registered on the servient tenement. Properly
    interpreted, s. 113(5)(a)(iv) could protect them from losing, unfairly, a right
    of way they continue to use and enjoy, openly.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument on appeal, the appellants submitted that the application judge’s
    interpretation of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) creates a title search problem, in that it
    defeats the 40-year title search rule, and effectively requires a search back
    to the Crown grant. I reject this argument. The words “openly enjoying and
    using” do not point to doing a title search; rather, they point to conducting a
    careful inspection of the property and of all available (or new) surveys.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairness
    suggests that a right of way that was once registered and continues to be
    openly enjoyed and used should be exempted from the operation of the 40-year
    rules set out in Part III. This must have been what the Legislature intended – and
    is what a proper interpretation of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) requires.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to these factors, I reject the appellants’ argument that s.
    113(5)(a)(iv) applies only to prescriptive easements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also reject the appellants’ argument that the impact of Land Titles conversion
    has any bearing on the interpretation of s. 113(5)(a)(iv). Section 113(5)(a)(iv)
    was enacted originally in 1966, prior to the enactment of any section authorizing
    conversion to Land Titles. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the factors I have enumerated mandate the interpretation I have
    reached. The fact that the Legislature may not have addressed the impact of
    Land Titles conversion does not diminish the weight of those factors. I
    conclude that s. 113(5)(a)(iv) can apply to preserve a right of way that was once
    registered but that is no longer validly registered.</p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>An applicant must show open
    enjoyment and use from the expiration of the 40-year expiry period</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, to succeed in demonstrating that s. 113(5)(a)(iv) applies in
    a particular case, an applicant must show that, at least while governed by the <em>Registry
    Act</em>, the owner(s) of the dominant tenement have openly enjoyed and used
    the right of way continuously from the expiration of the 40-year expiry period
    in relation to the creation of the right of way on the servient tenement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reach this conclusion because of the requirements of s. 113(5)(a)(iv). I agree
    with Lang J.A.’s <em>obiter</em> description of those requirements in <em>Ramsay</em>.
    On a plain reading of s. 113(5)(a)(iv), the subsection has two requirements.
    First, to be excepted, the claim must be a right of way or easement or other
    right. Second, if that requirement is satisfied, the claimant will be required
    to establish current usage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, to satisfy the first requirement, the right of way must not have
    expired through the operation of the 40-year expiry period. Under s. 113(1), a
    “claim that is still in existence on the last day of the notice period <em>expires</em> at the end of that day unless a notice of claim has been registered.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    no notice of claim has been registered, which is the situation in this case,
    “notice period” means the period ending on the day 40 years after the day of
    the registration of an instrument that first creates a claim. This means that,
    where a notice of claim has not been registered, unless s. 113(5)(a)(iv)
    applies, a right of way will expire 40 years after it was created. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the right of way expired at any point following the expiration of the 40-year
    expiry period, it would no longer be a valid right of way. To show that the
    right of way has never ceased to be a valid right of way, a claimant must
    satisfy the other requirement of s. 113(5)(a)(iv), namely open enjoyment and
    use.  Accordingly, to qualify for the exception in s. 113(5)(a)(iv), a claimant
    must show open enjoyment and use continuously from the expiration of the 40-year
    expiry period – at least to the date of any Land Titles conversion, at which
    point the <em>Land Titles Act</em> would apply. </p>
  <h2>(2)The application of s. 113(5)(a)(iv) to the facts of this case</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, the application judge found that the respondents were openly
    enjoying and using the laneway as at the date of the application. Although he
    did not expressly address whether they had demonstrated open enjoyment and use
    of the laneway from the expiration of the expiry period, he did discuss whether
    their evidence could show a prescriptive easement. He found the respondents’
    evidence insufficient to meet the test for a prescriptive easement prior to
    2003, the Land Titles conversion date for 7 Cunningham Avenue.<a href="#_ftn16"
name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[16]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, 
    read as a whole, in my view, the application judge’s reasons demonstrate that,
    had he turned his mind to the issue, he would have made a finding that the
    respondents had demonstrated open enjoyment and use of the right of way from
    the expiration of the expiry period, whether it was 1988 or 1994. That is
    because he observed there were statutory declarations registered on title
    purporting to show continuous usage of the rights of way from the date of their
    creation. Further, he concluded the vague assertions of the appellant Kane,
    based on information and belief, concerning the positions of prior owners, were
    either not admissible or not sufficiently cogent to disprove the respondents’
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his reasons, at paras. 12 and 13, the application judge said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>There are statutory declarations
    registered on title that purport to show continuous usage of the rights-of-way
    as far back as their creation in 1948. [The appellant,] Kane[,] recites, by way
    of information and belief, some evidence to the contrary</span>. I note that
    the evidence from [a prior owner] is not inconsistent with the evidence of
    long-term use by the [respondents]. The evidence of the [appellants’] next door
    neighbour is double hearsay and inadmissible as the neighbour is not
    identified. The evidence concerning [other prior owners] is wholly
    unparticularized.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While <span class=Underline>I would not accept this evidence as
    disproving the [respondents'] evidence</span>, I do not need to make a
    historical finding in this case. The [respondents'] do assert prescriptive
    easements. They do not have sufficient evidence to meet the test prior to 2003
    when 7 Cunningham Ave. was registered under qualified land titles. As is dealt
    with below, subclause 113 (5)(a)(iv) of the <em>Registry Act</em>, does require

    right-of-way. <span class=Underline>As noted above however, the [appellants] do
    not deny the [respondents'] evidence concerning their present use of the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, based on my review of the record, I am satisfied that, collectively,
    the evidence supports a finding that the respondents  openly enjoyed and used
    and enjoyed  the right of way from at least the expiration of the expiry period,
    to 2003, when the servient tenement was converted to Land Titles, and from that
    date to the date of the application. I base this conclusion on the following
    factors:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>depending on one’s view of whether the 1948 deed or the 1954 deed
    created the right of way at issue over 7 Cunningham Avenue, the 40-year expiry
    period elapsed in either 1988 or 1994;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the record includes a document purporting to be a copy of the
    parcel register for 7 Cunningham Avenue. That document discloses a date of
    conversion to Land Titles of February 24, 2003;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the respondents’ evidence includes statutory declarations from individuals
    claiming to have owned 78 Brock Avenue (the most southerly property claiming
    access to the right of way), between June 20, 1946 and July 17, 2003.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[17]</span></span></span></a> The declarants of these statutory declarations claim to have had, during the
    period they each owned 78 Brock Avenue, either “free and uninterrupted use” or “continuous,
    open, undisturbed and undisputed use” of a right of way over 7 Cunningham
    Avenue, which had a width of approximately seven feet six inches and a depth of
    approximately 89 feet nine inches; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the respondents’ evidence also included a statutory declaration
    from a Jenny Ramlogan who claimed to have owned 80 Brock Avenue between 1998
    and September 14, 2009. In the statutory declaration, Ms. Ramlogan claims that
    while she (or she and her husband) owned 80 Brock Avenue they used, on a
    regular and continuous basis, the right of way over 7 Cunningham Avenue, which
    was referenced in their deed and also shown on a survey dated May 2, 1986. She
    also states that the right of way has been used, “based on [her] personal
    knowledge and observations, by the owners of 78, 82 [sic], and 84 Brock Avenue,
    and/or their tenants and guests” throughout her period of ownership;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>each of the respondents filed an affidavit establishing their
    open enjoyment and use of the right of way from the date they acquired their
    respective properties: Brown – 2003, Gold – 2009, and Fairley – 2001.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the photographs appended as exhibits to the respondent Elaine
    Gold’s affidavit demonstrate the impossibility of gaining vehicular access to
    the dwellings depicted by the photographs except by use of the laneway depicted
    in the photographs;  and </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the photographs appended as exhibit 12 to the respondent Elaine
    Gold’s affidavit bear out the application judge’s comment discounting the
    appellant Kane’s claim that when the appellant’s bought their home, there was
    no suggestion any of the respondents had a right to use 7 Cunningham Avenue: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>He must not have realized that the laneway was part of the
    property that he was buying since it is perfectly obvious that it serves as the
    driveway for the [respondents’] homes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    the application judge, I conclude, for the reasons he stated, that the
    appellants’ evidence does not displace the respondents’ evidence of ongoing
    open enjoyment and use.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge that only one of the respondents (Brown) filed direct evidence
    demonstrating open enjoyment and use of the laneway from the expiration of the
    expiry period until 2003. Further, the record does not reveal when the
    respondents’ houses depicted in the photographs I have referred to were built. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    taken as a whole, I am satisfied that the record creates an inference, on a
    balance of probabilities, that all of the respondents and their predecessors in
    title, dating back to at least 1988, openly enjoyed and used the right of way. That
    is because using the laneway is the only realistic way to access the
    respondents’ homes and associated parking.</p>
