  <p class=Heading>INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An accident occurred on May 1, 2009, at the intersection of Yonge Street
    and Richmond Street in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Whose fault was it? In this
    appeal, the answer to that question depends upon how rule 5(1) of the <em>Fault
    Determination Rules</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 668 (the “<em>FDRs</em>”)<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> is interpreted</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 5(1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>5.(1) If an incident is not described in any of these
    rules, the degree of fault of the insured shall be determined in accordance
    with <span class=Underline>the ordinary rules of law.</span> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As will be seen, the meaning of the emphasized words in rule 5(1) is critical.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The role that rule 3 of the <em>FDRs </em>is to play, if any, in
    interpreting the emphasized words is also crucial. Rule 3 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>3. The degree of fault of an insured is determined
    without reference to,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(a) the circumstances in which the incident occurs,
    including weather conditions, road conditions, visibility or the actions of
    pedestrians; or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(b) the location on the insured’s automobile of the
    point of contact with any other automobile involved in the incident. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>BACKGROUND</p>
  <h2>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Accident</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the day in question, Ali Shalforoushzadeh (“Ali”) was driving his
    motorcycle southbound in the curb lane of Yonge Street, approaching the
    intersection where the accident took place. Some cars were stopped in the
    southbound passing lane to Ali’s left.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Eric Basciano (“Eric”) was driving his car in the northbound passing
    lane on Yonge Street. He was on his way back to the hair salon that he owned,
    which was located near the intersection in question. He needed to turn left at
    the intersection. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intersection does not have traffic lights guiding the flow of
    traffic.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Traffic was heavy. Eric stopped his car in the northbound passing lane
    and waited for a break in the southbound traffic so that he could turn left. He
    waited for a while and was then “waved through” the intersection by a driver
    who was stopped in the southbound passing lane. Eric did not see Ali and his motorcycle
    before he turned. It was only after Eric completed his turn that he heard
    skidding sounds. When he checked his rearview mirror, he saw a motorcycle
    skidding through the intersection. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no collision between the two vehicles. However, as a result of
    Eric’s turn into the southbound lane of traffic, Ali swerved. He lost control
    of his motorcycle, fell to the ground and was injured. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ali
    applied to his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“State
    Farm”), for accident benefits payments. State Farm paid him the benefits and
    then sought indemnification from Eric’s insurer, Aviva Canada Inc. (“Aviva”),
    under the loss transfer provisions of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. I.8 (the “<em>Act</em>”).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <h2>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Arbitration Award</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State
    Farm and Aviva did not agree on the matter of indemnification and took the
    matter to arbitration. The arbitration proceeded on the basis of their agreement
    that fault was to be determined based on rule 5(1) of the <em>FDRs</em>. The
    parties were divided, however, on how rule 5(1) was to be interpreted and applied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    an award dated February 14, 2014 (the “Award”), the arbitrator determined that Eric
    was 100% at fault for the accident. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator heard the oral testimony of both drivers. She also had before her
    the transcripts of the examination for discovery of the drivers. She weighed
    the evidence and made the following findings of fact:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ali clearly had the right of way as he proceeded southbound on
    Yonge Street, approaching the intersection in question;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ali did not have a full view of the intersection as he approached
    it because of cars that were stopped in the passing lane to his left;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there was no evidence that Ali was travelling at a speed faster
    than approximately 30 km/hr, a speed well below the posted speed limit of 50
    km/hr;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eric did not see Ali’s motorcycle before making his left turn,
    although “it is clear that the motorcycle was there to be seen”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there was no impact between the vehicles but as a result of Eric’s
    turn, Ali lost control of his motorcycle, fell to the ground and sustained
    injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator then considered how rule 5(1) was to be applied. She concluded that rule
    5(1) calls for an analysis that is distinct from the approach required in a
    pure tort analysis. Her reasoning can be summarized as follows.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    5(1) of the <em>FDRs</em> requires that the insured’s degree of fault be
    determined in accordance with “the ordinary rules of law”. The <em>FDRs </em>are
    a complete code referenced in s. 275 of the <em>Act</em>. Any fault determination
    conducted under the <em>FDRs </em>must be informed by rule 3 of the <em>FDRs</em>,
    which is an umbrella provision. Rule 3 requires that the degree of fault be
    determined without reference to various circumstances, including the weather and
    road conditions, actions of pedestrians, and the location on the insured’s
    automobile of the point of impact. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator went on to say that relevant <em>Highway Traffic Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. H.8<em> </em>(“<em>HTA</em>”)<em> </em>provisions and case law should
    not be ignored. She took note of rule 12(5) of the <em>FDRs</em>, which dictates
    a finding of 100% fault on the part of a left-turning vehicle where there is a
    collision between that vehicle and one proceeding straight through an intersection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator also noted that the <em>HTA</em> provisions regarding left-turning
    vehicles are consistent with rule 12(5). Section 141(5) of the <em>HTA </em>states
    that a driver must not turn left at an intersection into the path of an
    oncoming vehicle unless that driver has “afforded a reasonable opportunity to
    the driver or operator of the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator found that Eric – the driver of the left-turning vehicle – did not
    see Ali approaching the intersection on his motorcycle and, therefore, could
    not have provided Ali with the opportunity to avoid the collision. She also
    found that Ali’s motorcycle “was there to be seen” even though Eric testified
    he did not see Ali approaching the intersection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator opined that if this case had been considered within the context of a
    tort action, some contributory negligence might be attributed to Ali based on <em>Nash
    v</em>. <em>Sullivan</em> (1973), 1 O.R. (2d) 133, 1973 CanLII 785 (C.A.). However,
    because of her analysis of the loss transfer provisions, she found Eric to be
    100% at fault for the accident. </p>
  <h2>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Order under Appeal</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva
    brought an application in which it appealed the Award. By order dated October
    10, 2014 (the “Order”), the application judge set aside the Award and declared that
    Ali was 50% at fault for the accident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted the arbitrator’s determination that Ali had the right
    of way, a matter that was not disputed. He also noted the arbitrator’s finding
    that the motorcycle “was there to be seen” and stated that “there is no basis
    to consider this finding of fact unreasonable”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the application judge said that the arbitrator erred in law when she disregarded
    the circumstance that cars were stopped to Ali’s left as he approached the
    intersection and failed to attribute contributory negligence. The application
    judge saw nothing in the provisions relating to the loss transfer scheme which required
    that circumstance to be ignored. He said that Ali’s failure to be alert as he
    approached the intersection – given that cars were stopped to his left – was the
    same type and degree of negligence as that of Eric. Based on <em>Nash</em>, the
    application judge apportioned fault for the accident on a 50/50 basis.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State
    Farm appeals to this court, asking that the Order be set aside and the Award be
    reinstated. It submits that the application judge erred by:</p>
  <p class=Numberedlist>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>making a finding of fact that the arbitrator did not make;</p>
  <p class=Numberedlist>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failing to give deference to the arbitrator’s findings of fact and
    negligence under the ordinary rules of law;</p>
  <p class=Numberedlist>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>applying <em>Nash</em> to the facts of this case; and</p>
  <p class=Numberedlist>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>finding that the arbitrator incorrectly interpreted rule 5(1) of the <em>FDR</em>s. </p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=Heading>Issue #1: A Finding of Fact not made by the Arbitrator</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found Ali to be 50% at fault because he failed to be alert
    when approaching the intersection, despite the fact that cars were stopped to
    his left. State Farm says that it was an error for the application judge to
    have made the finding that Ali failed to be alert.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator heard the oral evidence and made no such finding. It was she who had
    the advantage of seeing and hearing the testimony first-hand. In this case, the
    evidence was mainly testimonial – as opposed to documentary – and credibility
    was in issue. In such a case, the application judge should have been wary of
    making such a finding: <em>Hollis v. Dow Corning Corp.</em>,<em> </em>[1995] 4

  <p class=Heading>Issue #2: Deference Owed to the Arbitrator’s Findings </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State
    Farm submits that unless unreasonable, arbitral conclusions of mixed fact and
    law are entitled to deference. Therefore, because the application judge found
    the arbitrator’s findings of fact to be reasonable, State Farm says that he
    committed an error in law in setting aside her finding of fault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this submission is misguided. The application judge set aside the
    arbitrator’s finding of fault because he viewed the arbitrator as having erred
    in law in determining fault under rule 5(1) of the <em>FDRs</em>. Thus, the
    question is whether the arbitrator applied the correct legal principles in
    making that determination. That question is the subject matter of Issue #4.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Issue #3: Whether <em>Nash </em>Applies</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the arbitrator’s factual findings, in my view, <em>Nash </em>does not apply and
    the application judge erred in so doing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Nash</em>, a driver was waiting to make a left turn at an intersection (the
    “Defendant”). He was travelling on a through street with two lanes in either
    direction. Traffic was heavy in both directions. An oncoming motorcyclist
    approached the intersection. Cars in the passing lane to the left of the
    motorcyclist were stopped. The driver of one of those stopped cars flashed his
    lights, indicating to the Defendant that he would wait while the Defendant made
    his left turn. The Defendant moved slowly into the intersection and hit the
    motorcyclist, who had approached the intersection in such a manner that he was
    hidden from the view of oncoming motorists intending to make a left turn.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found the Defendant to be 100% liable for the accident because the
    motorcyclist had the right of way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court set aside the trial decision and held that the Defendant and the
    motorcyclist were equally at fault for the accident. It held that the
    motorcyclist was negligent in failing to slow his motorcycle and keep a proper
    look-out when he saw, or should have seen, that the cars to his left had
    stopped and because he approached the intersection in such a manner that he was
    hidden from the view of motorists intending to make a left turn.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there are a number of common features between this case and <em>Nash</em>,
    there is one significant factual difference. In <em>Nash</em>, as the
    motorcyclist approached the intersection, he was hidden from the view of the oncoming
    left-turning drivers. The facts of this case, on that point, are completely to
    the contrary. Not only was there no finding that Ali was hidden from the view
    of motorists intending to make a left turn into the intersection, the
    arbitrator expressly found that Ali was “there to be seen”. It is noteworthy
    that the application judge commented on this finding, saying that there was no
    basis to consider it unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, in my view, the application judge erred in applying <em>Nash </em>and
    apportioning liability.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will conclude by responding to two other considerations raised by Aviva. </p>
  <h5>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    5(1), it will be recalled, reads as follows: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>5. (1) If an incident is not described in any of
    these rules, the degree of fault of the insured shall be determined in accordance
    with the ordinary rules of law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the accident in this case is not described in any of the <em>FDRs</em>, rule
    5(1) applies to determine fault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to rule 5(1), the degree of fault of each insured is to be determined in
    accordance with “the ordinary rules of law” (the “quoted words”). Therefore, to
    correctly apply rule 5(1), we must first understand what is meant by the quoted
    words.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator proceeded on the basis that fault determination under rule 5(1) must
    be informed by the instruction given in rule 3 of the <em>FDRs</em>. Because
    rule 3 requires the degree of fault to be determined without reference to the
    circumstances in which the incident occurs, in the arbitrator’s view, the
    quoted words in rule 5(1) call for an approach distinct from a pure tort law
    analysis. To determine the degree of fault, she looked at rule 12(5) of the <em>FDRs</em> – which governs situations similar to this case except that they involve a
    collision – and s.&nbsp;141(5) of the <em>HTA</em>. She did not use tort law to
    determine fault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge acknowledged that rules 1 through 5 of the <em>FDRs </em>are provisions
    of general application. However, he saw nothing in them that would require the
    court to disregard the circumstances of the accident – specifically, that the
    cars to Ali’s left as he approached the intersection were stopped – for the purposes
    of determining fault under rule 5(1). In his view, it was an error in law for
    the arbitrator to have disregarded that circumstance. As a result, he set aside
    her decision and determined fault in accordance with the tort law jurisprudence,
    specifically, the <em>Nash </em>decision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State
    Farm says that, for the reasons given by the arbitrator, it was she who interpreted
    rule 5(1) correctly, not the application judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva
    takes the opposite position. It says that the application judge was right to
    reject the arbitrator’s use of rule 3 when determining fault under rule 5(1). It
    contends that rule 3 applies when fault is determined under rules 6 through 19
    of the <em>FDRs</em> but the quoted words dictate that fault under rule 5(1) is
    to be determined through the application of tort law. Aviva points to some judicial
    and arbitral decisions as support for its position.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the arbitrator correctly interpreted and applied the quoted words in rule
    5(1), having regard to the purpose and scheme of the loss transfer provisions as
    a whole. Accordingly, there was no basis for the application judge to set aside
    the Award and substitute his own determinations as to fault.</p>
  <h5>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreting “the ordinary rules of law” in rule 5(1) </h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    meaning to be given to the “ordinary rules of law” in rule 5(1) of the <em>FDRs</em> is a matter of statutory interpretation. I make this seemingly obvious point
    because the decisions relied on by Aviva have not approached the matter in that
    fashion. Instead, those decisions are based on the assumption that the words
    “the ordinary rules of law” in rule 5(1) mean “the ordinary rules of <span
class=Underline>tort</span> law”. I pause to note that it would have been a
    simple matter for the legislature to have included the word “tort” in the
    quoted words in rule 5(1), had that been its intention. In any event, when the
    meaning of the quoted words is approached as a matter of statutory
    interpretation, it becomes clear that the word “tort” should not be read into
    rule 5(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a matter of statutory interpretation, the task is to discover the intention of
    the legislator as expressed by the words “the ordinary rules of law”. To
    accomplish that task, those words are to be considered in their entire context,
    and read in their grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the legislative
    framework within which they are found: <em>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v</em>. <em>Rex</em>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 26, 55. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    quoted words are within rule 5(1), rule 5(1) is part of the <em>FDRs</em>, and
    the <em>FDRs</em> are an integral part of Ontario’s loss transfer scheme. Ontario’s
    loss transfer scheme, therefore, provides the context within which to consider
    the quoted words.  Thus, I begin with a consideration of that scheme.  </p>

    accident benefits, rather than seeking compensation from third parties (and
    their insurers). The Ontario legislature introduced the loss transfer scheme to
    address the cost implications for insurers of moving to this partial no-fault
    system: Ontario Insurance Commission (now the Financial Services Commission of

    insurer”. It is the indemnification of the first party insurer by the second
    party insurer which is known as “loss transfer”.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>FDRs </em>consist of twenty rules. The first five rules are general
    provisions. Those provisions are discussed below. Rules 6 through 19 contain a
    series of general types of incidents and specify the fault to be attributed to
    each driver in each incident. Fault is not a nuanced determination in rules 6
    through 19: it is typically assigned as 50% or 100%. Rule 20 provides the rules
    for fault determination when a driver involved in an incident is charged with a
    driving offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If,
    as in this case, the first party and second party insurers cannot agree on
    indemnification under s. 275, s. 275(4) of the <em>Act </em>requires them to

    legislation which creates the loss transfer scheme consists of the relevant
    provisions of the <em>Act </em>together with the <em>FDRs</em>. The purpose of
    the loss transfer scheme is to provide for an expedient and summary method of
    spreading the cost of statutory accident benefits among insurers, in a gross
    and somewhat arbitrary fashion, favouring expediency and economy over finite
    exactitude: <em>Jevco Insurance Co. v. York Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1996),

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    ease of reference, I set out rule 3 again now:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>3. The degree of fault of an insured is determined
    without reference to,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(a) the circumstances in which the incident occurs,
    including weather conditions, road conditions, visibility or the actions of
    pedestrians; or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(b) the location on the insured’s automobile of the
    point of contact with any other automobile involved in the incident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    plain reading of rule 3, considered in conjunction with its location in the <em>FDRs</em> and the purpose of the loss transfer scheme, leads me to conclude that rule 3
    informs all fault determinations made under the <em>FDRs</em>, including those
    made pursuant to rule 5(1).</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>The wording of rule 3 </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    3 says that fault is to be determined “without reference to … the circumstances
    in which the incident occurs”. There is nothing in the wording of rule 3 which limits
    its application to rules 6 through 19, as Aviva contends. On a plain reading,
    rule 3 applies to all determinations of fault made under the <em>FDRs</em>,
    including those made under rule 5(1)<em>.</em></p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Rule 3’s location in the <span
class=LHeading11Char><span style='font-style:normal'>FDRs</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rules
    1 through 5 of the <em>FDRs</em> are located under the heading “General”. The wording
    of rules 1 through 5 and their location at the beginning of the regulation show
    that they are rules of general application in the <em>FDRs</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    1 defines the “centre line” of a roadway. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    2(1) provides that an insurer “shall determine the degree of fault of its

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    3, as I have just explained, limits the way in which fault is determined under
    the <em>FDRs</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span

    any of the <em>FDRs</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    rule 3’s location in the <em>FDRs </em>supports the view that it is a rule of
    general application and informs fault determinations made under rule 5(1), as
    well as those made under rules 6 through 19. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Rule 3 in light of the purpose of Ontario’s
    loss transfer scheme</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    view that rule 3 informs all fault determinations made under the <em>FDRs</em>,
    including those made pursuant to rule 5(1), is further reinforced by reference
    to the purpose of Ontario’s loss transfer scheme. That purpose, as previously indicated,
    is to provide an expedient and summary method of resolving indemnification
    claims. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    determination of fault in tort law is often a lengthy, detailed and nuanced process,
    which requires findings of fact on the very circumstances excluded from
    consideration by rule 3. By precluding a pure tort law approach to fault
    determination, rule 3 acts in harmony with the purpose of the legislative scheme
    because it promotes an expedient, more summary approach for determining fault.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><em><span style='font-style:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em>“The ordinary rules of law” considered in context</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    determined that rule 3 informs fault determinations made under rule 5(1), “the
    ordinary rules of law” cannot be interpreted as “the ordinary rules of tort law”.
    A determination of fault based on tort law rules would necessarily engage a
    consideration of the circumstances that the legislature purposefully excluded
    from consideration by rule 3. Furthermore, as already discussed, resort to pure
    tort law for the determination of fault would run contrary to the purpose of
    the loss transfer scheme, which is to provide an expedient and summary way of
    resolving indemnification claims. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recourse
    to pure tort law for the determination of fault under rule 5(1) would also run
    contrary to s. 275(2) of the <em>Act</em>. Section 275(2) of the <em>Act</em>,
    it will be recalled, provides that indemnification depends on fault and fault
    is to be determined under the <em>FDRs</em>. In short, s. 275 establishes the <em>FDRs</em> as a complete code for determining fault in the indemnification context.  This
    dictate is reinforced by rule 2 of the <em>FDRs</em>, which provides that insurers
    are to determine the degree of fault of their insureds in accordance with the <em>FDRs</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    as I noted previously, had the legislature intended that fault determinations under
    rule 5(1) were to be made in accordance with the ordinary rules of tort law, it
    would have been an easy matter to have included the word “tort”. It did not do
    so. In my view, that was a deliberate decision because it enabled rules 3 and
    5(1) to be read in harmony with one another and the whole of the legislative
    scheme.  </p>

    #1 – Aviva says that if fault is not determined under rule 5(1) in accordance
    with tort law, the parameters for fault determination under that rule are unclear.
    I accept this complaint to a point: it is correct that determining fault without
    reference to pure tort law creates some uncertainty as to what can be referred
    to, in making that determination. However, as the Award in the present case demonstrates,
    reference can be made to “rules of law”, despite there being no clear
    definition of those words. In the Award, the arbitrator referred to two things,
    both of which fall within the meaning of “the ordinary rules of law” as those
    words are used in rule 5(1) of the <em>FDRs</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the arbitrator referred to rule 12(5) of the <em>FDRs</em>. Rule 12(5) deals
    with incidents very similar to that in the present case. Rule 12(5) applies
    where a collision results from a driver turning left into the path of an
    oncoming vehicle.  It does not apply in this case because there was no
    collision between the two vehicles.  Under rule 12(5), the driver of the
    left-turning vehicle is 100% at fault. Although not directly applicable, rule
    12(5) provides persuasive guidance for fault determination in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the arbitrator considered s. 141(5) of the <em>HTA</em>.  Section 141(5) provides
    that a driver shall not turn left across the path of an approaching vehicle “unless
    he or she has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the driver or operator of
    the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision.” The arbitrator noted that Eric,
    as the left-turning driver, testified that he did not see Ali approaching the
    intersection on his motorcycle and so could not have provided him with an
    opportunity to avoid a collision. In her opinion, the fact that there was no
    collision did not take away from Eric’s obligations in this regard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    consideration of s. 141(5) of the <em>HTA </em>led the arbitrator to the same
    fault determination as that indicated by reference to rule 12(5). Accordingly,
    the arbitrator determined that Eric was 100% at fault for the incident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator’s fault determination could be criticized for being insufficiently
    nuanced. However, her approach is consistent with the legislative scheme, which
    is to provide an expedient and summary method of determining fault for the
    purposes of indemnification.  As this court observed in <em>Jevco v. York Fire</em>,
    at para. 9, fault determinations under the <em>FDRs </em>are done in a gross
    and somewhat arbitrary fashion, favouring expediency and economy over finite
    exactitude.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Point
    #2 – Aviva pointed to three decisions as support for its position that the
    words “the ordinary rules of law” mean “the ordinary rules of tort law” for the
    purposes of rule 5(1): <em>Markel Insurance Co. of Canada v. Certas Direct
    Insurance Co</em>., 2011 ONSC 6069; <em>The Germania Farmers’ Mutual Fire Insurance
    Co. v. Federated Insurance Company of Canada</em> (15 November 2006), arbitral
    award of Stephen M. Malach (Ont. Arb.); and <em>ING Insurance Co. of Canada v.
    Farmers’ Mutual Insurance Co.</em>, 2007 CarswellOnt 3462, [2007] O.J. No. 2150
    (S.C.). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the first two cases, I agree that the decision maker applied the ordinary rules
    of tort law when allocating fault pursuant to rule 5(1).  However, neither undertook
    a statutory interpretation of the quoted words before so doing.  It appears
    that both decision makers simply assumed that “the ordinary rules of law” means
    “the ordinary rules of tort law”.  On my reading of the third decision, it does
    not apply rule 5(1) nor address how the quoted words in it are to be
    interpreted.  Thus, none of these decisions offer a reason for following a pure
    tort law approach to fault determination under rule 5(1).</p>
  <p class=Heading>DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would allow the appeal and set aside the Order, thereby
    restoring the Award. I would order costs of this appeal to the appellant fixed
    at $9,000, inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its factum, the appellant sought its costs, which I understand to include costs
    before the application judge and the arbitrator. In light of the result on
    appeal, the general practice in this court would be to reverse the costs award
    below. However, in the absence of submissions on this matter, I would not
    decide it. If the parties are unable to resolve the matter of the costs below,
    I would permit them to file written submissions to a maximum of three pages,
    such submissions to be filed within ten days of the date of release of these
    reasons.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the costs of the arbitration, if the parties are unable to resolve that
    matter, I would order that they be referred to the arbitrator for determination.</p>
