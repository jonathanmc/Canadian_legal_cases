    from his conviction by a jury of the offence of sexual interference for acts
    involving the complainant contrary to s. 151(a) of the </span><em>Criminal Code
    of Canada</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. His conviction

    complainant's prior consistent statements. </span></span></h3>

  <p class=Heading><em>The complainant's evidence</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant was almost 13 years old
    when she testified at trial. She said that the appellant touched her "private
    parts" with his "private parts" on more than 10 occasions when she was 6 or 7
    years old, during the times that the appellant babysat her with her younger
    sister at the appellant's apartment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant was thoroughly
    cross-examined by defence counsel on the major inconsistencies present in her
    prior statements to her grandmother and the police, and in her evidence at the
    preliminary inquiry and at trial. Those inconsistencies included the
    perpetrator, nature and severity of the assaults.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In the re-examination of the

class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant concedes that the
    complainant's prior consistent statements were admissible for the purpose of
    showing the narrative and context of the complainant's complaints. No issue is
    taken with the Crown's use of the statements.</span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The focus of the appeal is on the absence
    of a limiting instruction. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    failing to warn the jury that the complainant's prior consistent statements
    could not be used for their truth, to prove that sexual contact had occurred.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Crown argues that a warning was
    unnecessary, as it was the defence that elicited most of the prior statements. Defence
    counsel did not request the limiting instruction at trial.</span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>To succeed on this appeal, the
    appellant must establish that a jury instruction concerning the use that the
    jury could make of the complainant's prior consistent statements should have
    been given and that its omission amounted to legal error. See </span><em>R. v.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Prior consistent statements are
    presumptively inadmissible because they lack probative value and constitute
    hearsay when adduced for the truth of their contents. They are potentially
    dangerous because they may mislead the trier of fact into thinking that, because
    a person said the same thing on more than one occasion, it is more likely to be
    true. See  </span><em>R. v. Dinardo</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, 2008 SCC

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    admitted to rebut recent fabrication or defence allegations of inconsistency,
    or as narrative, a warning against substantive use of the statements is usually
    required. This instruction should indicate that the prior complaints are not
    admitted for the truth of their contents and that the jury is to consider only
    the fact that the complainants were made to assist them in understanding what
    occurred and why:  </span><em>Dinardo</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, at para.

class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>There are some exceptions to the
    general rule. A limiting instruction is not always necessary and may be
    confusing where "the defence was relying on the prior statement to support its
    theory," "where it was clear to the jury that the prior statement was not
    offered as proof of the underlying facts, or where the concern about
    self-corroboration is simply not present":  </span><em>R. v.</em><span

  <p class=Heading><em>Whether a limiting instruction was necessary in this case</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant's prior statements
    played a major role at trial. They went to the core question of the reliability
    and credibility of the complainant's evidence.  As a result, a limiting
    instruction was necessary to avoid the real risk that the jury would rely on
    the complainant's prior statements for an impermissible purpose.  Its omission
    was an error of law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>There were major inconsistencies in the
    complainant's various versions of relevant events that were contained in her
    statements to her grandmother and police, and in her testimony at the preliminary
    inquiry and at trial. In particular, between the complainant's first disclosure
    at age 11 to her grandmother and the police, and her evidence at trial, the
    nature and severity of the alleged assaults dramatically lessened from allegations
    of the appellant's attempted intercourse with the complainant to his touching her
    over her clothes. Further, the complainant's statement that "they" (meaning the
    appellant and his friend, James) touched her narrowed to her trial evidence
    that only the appellant touched her.</span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant's prior inconsistent
    statements were introduced by defence counsel during her cross-examination of
    the complainant in order to impeach her credibility and reliability as a
    witness. Defence counsel challenged the complainant's credibility and
    reliability by comprehensively cross-examining her on the inconsistencies in
    her statements. The complainant was not asked to and did not adopt as true her
    prior statements. Rather, she acknowledged that they were incorrect. In her
    closing submissions to the jury, defence counsel described the complainant's
    inconsistencies in considerable detail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>During his re-examination of the
    complainant, his examination in chief of her grandmother, and in closing
    argument, Crown counsel sought to counteract the damaging effects of the
    complainant's cross-examination by referring to her prior consistent complaints.
    Crown counsel referenced the complainant's prior consistent statements of her
    complaint as part of the narrative and logical framework of her disclosure of
    the allegations of sexual abuse. In this way, Crown counsel asserted the
    consistency of the complainant's core evidence about the assaults, and
    contended that her prior inconsistent statements were not inconsistent on
    material matters. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Relying heavily on </span><em>Demetrius</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, the Crown argues that a limiting jury instruction was not
    necessary in this case. Defence counsel introduced and relied on the
    complainant's prior inconsistent statements during the complainant's
    cross-examination and in closing submissions to the jury. That defence strategy
    opened the door to the Crown's referring to the complainant's prior consistent
    statements.  In those circumstances, a limiting instruction would have confused
    the jury.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>I do not accept these submissions.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Demetrius</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> is distinguishable
    from the present case. The complainant made a statement that identified Mr.
    Demetrius as the person who shot him. As part of his defence, Mr. Demetrius
    relied on the contents of the complainant's prior consistent statement, in
    order to show that the complainant had come up with a quick lie. The complainant's
    prior consistent statement was essential to the defence theory of the case that
    he was falsely implicating Mr. Demetrius to exculpate himself from liability
    for a robbery. The defence strategy made the truth of the complainant's prior
    consistent statement relevant and the Crown was entitled to rely on it for that
    purpose.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>That is not the present case. Here, defence
    counsel only referenced the complainant's prior statements for the permissible
    goal of impeaching the complainant's credibility and reliability because of the
    inconsistencies in her various statements and her evidence at trial, and not
    for the truth of the statements' contents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The present case is akin to the
    circumstances of </span><em>R. v. Lajoie </em><span class=MsoPageNumber>(1993), </span>64 O.A.C. 213, leave to appeal refused, [1993] S.C.C.A. No. 188<span
class=MsoPageNumber>. In that case, the trial judge had allowed the Crown to
    admit evidence of the complainant's prior complaint of sexual assault. The prior
    complaint was admitted, not as a prior consistent statement to rebut an allegation
    of recent fabrication, but as evidence of the fact that the complainant had
    complained. This use was necessary to counter the defence, which was an "all-out
    attack on credibility": para. 11.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>This court held in </span><em>Lajoie</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, at para. 12, that the trial judge erred in failing to
    instruct the jury as to the limited evidentiary value of the complainant's
    prior complaint, notwithstanding that no such instruction was requested, for
    the following reasons:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>[L]eft as it was the jury may well
    have used the evidence for the very purpose they were not to use it, a form of
    self-corroboration. The jury should have been told that the evidence could not
    be used as proof of the truth of the facts stated, but was evidence of the fact
    that she had complained and so, depending on the view the jury took of that
    evidence, conduct consistent with her story. There was non-direction amounting
    to misdirection.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Those reasons apply equally to the
    present case.  Looking at the charge as a whole and considering it in the
    context of the closing submissions, there were unresolved gaps that gave rise
    to the risk that the jury would use the complainant's prior statements for the
    truth of their contents to bolster the complainant's credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Crown maintains that the failure of
    defence counsel to object to the charge indicates that the omission of the
    instruction was insignificant and could not have affected the outcome of the
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The failure of trial counsel to object
    to the charge is a factor in appellate review, for the following reasons as
    explained by Bastarache J. for the majority of the court in </span><em>Daley</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, at para. 58:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>While not decisive, failure of
    counsel to object is a factor in appellate review. The failure to register a
    complaint about the aspect of the charge that later becomes the ground for the
    appeal may be indicative of the seriousness of the alleged violation. See </span><em>Jacquard</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, at para. 38:  "In my opinion, defence counsel's failure
    to object to the charge says something about both the overall accuracy of the
    jury instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection."</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>However, counsel's failure to object is
    not determinative because the trial judge is ultimately responsible for the
    charge to the jury. If, as in the present case, the charge contains legal
    error, counsel's failure to object to the erroneous charge does not change the
    nature or effect of the legal error:  </span><em>R. v. Polimac</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2010 ONCA 346, </span><span class=ssl2>254 C.C.C. (3d)
    359, </span><span class=MsoPageNumber>at para. 97, leave to appeal refused,
    [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 263.  As a result, defence counsel's failure to object in
    the case at bar was immaterial in light of the legal error in the jury charge.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The failure of the trial judge in this
    case to give a limiting instruction left the jury without the analytical
    framework necessary to understand how they were to use the complainant's prior
    consistent statements. In particular, without this instruction, Crown counsel's
    reference to the complainant's prior consistent statements in his closing
    submissions was effectively the last word on the subject.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In his closing submissions, Crown
    counsel referred to the complainant's consistency in reporting her allegations
    over the years. This was done to counter the defence suggestion that the
    complainant's evidence was inconsistent and therefore incredible and
    unreliable. To make the point, Crown counsel emphasized the number of times
    that the complainant had "the guts" to repeat her version of events to her
    grandmother and to the police, at the preliminary inquiry, and at trial. In
    particular, Crown counsel highlighted the complainant's consistent repetition
    that "every time it's Geoff and James and those two girls and the details  [</span><span
class=MsoPageNumber>s]</span><span class=MsoPageNumber>he testified that it
    happened on the couch and on the floor, repeatedly, her privates being rubbed
    by Geoff".</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>However, without a limiting instruction,
    the jury could easily have misunderstood the significance of the complainant's
    prior consistent complaints, namely, that the complainant's repetition of
    events meant that her statements were true. This would contradict the premise
    for the rule that excludes prior consistent statements - that repetition does
    not make the statement more likely to be true:  </span><em>Divitaris</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, at para. 34.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The lack of a limiting instruction was particularly
    harmful in the present case because the complainant's prior statements served
    to shore up the complainant's trial evidence about the assaults that was
    otherwise questionable.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant testified that the
    appellant molested her when she was sitting on the couch or on the floor, with
    her legs out straight and slightly parted.  When she was sitting on the couch,
    she said that her feet would not be over the side of the couch or touch the
    floor, although her back was not up against the couch. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant said that when she was
    sitting on the couch or on the floor, the appellant would crouch down, his
    knees bent, his bottom not touching the floor, and his face level with hers. From
    that position, the appellant would touch the complainant's private parts with
    what she thought were the appellant's private parts. The complainant did not
    see the appellant's penis; she did not even look at the appellant, because she
    said that she was watching her sister being molested by the appellant's friend,
    James.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant confirmed that the
    appellant did not otherwise touch her.  When defence counsel questioned her about
    her prior inconsistent statement to her grandmother about the appellant
    touching the complainant's bottom, the complainant clarified that if she had
    said it to her grandmother, she would have meant that she was being spanked and
    that there was nothing sexual about it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>As defence counsel submitted to the
