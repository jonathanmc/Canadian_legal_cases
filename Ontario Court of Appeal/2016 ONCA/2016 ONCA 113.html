    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated August 4, 2015, with reasons reported

  <p class=Judge>By the Court<strong><span style='font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
font-weight:normal'>:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND IN BRIEF</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HBC CAN Real Property LP (“HBC CAN LP”) is a limited partnership whose
    sole limited partner is Hudson’s Bay Company (“HBC”) and whose sole general
    partner is HBC CAN Real Property Inc. (“HBC CAN Inc.”). HBC CAN Inc. is wholly
    owned by HBC.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HBC and HBC CAN Inc. are anchor tenants in three shopping malls:
    Yorkdale, Square One, and Scarborough Town Centre. They operate Hudson’s Bay stores
    at each of these three leased locations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The malls are owned and operated by the appellant landlords (the
    “Landlords”), represented in this matter by Oxford Properties Group (“Oxford”).
    HBC is the tenant under the Yorkdale lease. HBC CAN Inc., as general partner of
    HBC CAN LP, is the tenant under the Square One and Scarborough Town Centre
    leases. HBC and HBC CAN LP are the respondents (“Respondents”) in this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HBC and RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (“RioCan”) are entering into
    a real estate joint venture. HBC is to transfer ten real estate properties –
    five owned and five leased – to the joint venture. The five leases include its
    leases at Yorkdale, Square One, and Scarborough Town Centre (the “Leases”). RioCan
    is to contribute a 50% co-ownership interest in Georgian Mall and Oakville
    Place, as well as cash.  Originally, the plan was that all of the real estate
    assets of the joint venture would be transferred to a limited partnership, the
    general partner of which would be a corporation jointly controlled by HBC and
    RioCan.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HBC sought Oxford’s consent to assign and sublease the Leases for the
    purposes of the joint venture (while not conceding that consent was required). Oxford
    expressed concern about the degree of control that RioCan – one of its main
    competitors – would have over the Leases. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After various meetings between the parties, a revised joint venture was
    proposed. According to the Respondents, the changes were made to address
    Oxford’s concerns. The revised joint venture structure would consist of two
    limited partnerships, with the second being formed specifically to hold the
    Leases. The structure would be as follows:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Limited Partnership #1: RioCan-HBC LP</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    would be two limited partners: HBC and RioCan. HBC would initially hold
    approximately 90% of the partnership units and RioCan would hold the remaining
    approximately 10%;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sole general partner would be 2455034 Ontario Inc. (“245”), a company jointly
    controlled by HBC and RioCan;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of the assets to be contributed to the joint venture, other than the Leases, would
    be transferred to 245 (as the general partner) and, thus, be jointly controlled
    by HBC and RioCan.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Limited Partnership #2: HBC YSS LP</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    would be a sole limited partner, RioCan-HBC LP, which would hold approximately 99.9999%
    of the partnership units;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sole general partner would be HBC;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Respondents would assign the Leases to HBC in its capacity as the general
    partner of HBC YSS LP. The leased premises would then be sublet to HBC on a
    full “pass through” basis for the entire remaining terms of each lease,
    including renewals.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondents hoped that the revised structure would address Oxford’s
    concerns because the Leases would be assigned to HBC, in its capacity as
    general partner of HBC YSS LP, rather than to 245, a company jointly controlled
    by HBC and RioCan.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Oxford refused to consent, the Respondents brought an application under
    s. 23(2) of the <em>Commercial Tenancies Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, for a
    declaration that the Landlords’ consents were not required for assignment and
    sublease of the Leases or, alternatively, that the Landlords were unreasonably
    withholding their consent to such assignments and subleases.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found in favour of the Respondents. She noted that
    the Leases contain provisions that restrict their transfer or assignment. However,
    each of the Leases also contains an exception for an assignment to an affiliate
    of the existing tenant (the “affiliate exception”). She concluded that because
    the Leases will be assigned to HBC, as general partner of HBC YSS LP, the
    assignments fall within the affiliate exception. She also concluded that because
    the subsequent subleases will be to HBC, which is the same entity as the
    general partner (HBC), the subleases are permitted under the affiliate
    exception.   Therefore, the application judge found, no consent to the
    assignments and subleases is necessary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge then considered whether, if consent to the assignments were
    required, the Landlords had unreasonably withheld their consent. She found that
    the Landlords were entitled to withhold their consent under the Square One
    lease, which provides that consent to an assignment may be arbitrarily
    withheld. With respect to the Yorkdale and Scarborough Town Centre leases,
    however, the application judge found that HBC had met its burden of proving
    that the Landlords were acting unreasonably in withholding their consent. She
    explained that because HBC would continue to be the operator of the stores and
    liable under the Leases, there was no reason to believe HBC’s interests would diverge
    from those of Oxford, going forward.</p>

  <p class=Heading>THE ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oxford
    submits that the application judge erred by:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>holding that the assignment “to a limited partnership through its
    general partner” is an assignment to an affiliated company or corporation and
    therefore exempt from the consent requirement;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>finding, in the alternative, that the Yorkdale and Scarborough Town Centre
    leases require the Landlords to exercise their consent rights reasonably; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ignoring uncontested evidence and applying the wrong legal test to the
    evidence regarding the Landlords’ reasons for withholding consent.</p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=Heading>ISSUE #1: Assignment to an Affiliate</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oxford’s
    major complaint in this appeal is that the application judge failed to
    appreciate that the assignments of the Leases would result in the limited
    partnership (HBC YSS LP) having beneficial and effective ownership of the
    Leases. As the sole limited partner is RioCan-HBC LP, and referring to the
    joint venture agreement, Oxford says that the assignments will result in RioCan
    (its competitor), having decision-making power over certain significant actions
    that might be taken in connection with the Leases.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept Oxford’s characterization of the effect of the assignments.  This
    is not a case, as Oxford suggested, of HBC holding bare title or being a mere
    nominee for the true beneficial owner.  Furthermore, contrary to Oxford’s
    formulation of the first issue, the application judge did not hold that “an
    assignment to a limited partnership through its general partner was an
    assignment to an affiliate”.  Rather, she concluded that the proposed
    assignments of the Leases would be to the general partner and not to the
    limited partnership.  As such, what Oxford characterizes as the “beneficial” or
    “effective” ownership of the Leases cannot direct the analysis.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the application judge correctly concluded that, based on the unique
    legal nature of the limited partnership structure and the role played by the
    general partner, the Leases will be assigned to HBC, as general partner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge’s reasoning, which we adopt, can be summarized as follows. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    limited partnership is not a legal entity. It is required by law to have a
    general partner through which it normally acts: <em>Kucor Construction &amp;
    Developments &amp; Associates v. Canada Life Assurance Co. </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(1998)</span></em>, 41 O.R. (3d) 577, <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:
none'>1998 CanLII 4236</span> (C.A.). A limited partnership cannot hold
    title to real property. It can hold title to real property only through its
    general partner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the description of limited partnerships given in <i>Lehndorff General
    Partner Ltd., Re </i>(1993), 17 C.B.R. (3d) 24 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at paras. 17
    and 20, which this court quoted with approval in <i>Kucor</i>, the application
    judge drew three conclusions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    any property in which a limited partnership has an interest can be held only by
    the general partner. In the case of a lease, there can be no assignment of the
    lease to the limited partnership – it must be assigned to the general partner. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it is not simply a matter of the general partner acquiring legal title to the
    property. The general partner has control over the property and is solely
    responsible for the operations of the limited partnership. The limited partner,
    as a passive investor, is restricted from taking part in the control or
    management of the business. To do otherwise would jeopardise its limited
    partner status.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    from the perspective of the other contracting party, the general partner is
    solely liable for all payments under the contract and performance of all
    obligations thereunder. The limited partners have no such liability. In this
    case, once the Leases are assigned, the legal relationship will continue to be
    between the Landlords and HBC. There will be no relationship between the Landlords
    and the limited partner. HBC alone will be liable for rents and all amounts
    owing under the Leases. HBC alone will be responsible for compliance with all
    obligations and covenants under the Leases. Thus, there will be no change in
    the legal relationship between HBC and the Landlords following the assignments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the application judge stated, in determining who will be the
    assignee of the Leases, there is no reason to look beyond the fact that the Leases
    are being assigned to the general partner. HBC as the general partner is the
    assignee, the affiliate exception applies and consent is not required. Because
    the subsequent subleases are to HBC, which is the same entity as the general
    partner, the subleases are also permitted under the affiliate exception.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis for interfering with the application judge’s determination that,
    in light of the affiliate exception, the Respondents did not need consent to
    assign the Leases to HBC as general partner of the limited partnership. HBC is assigning
