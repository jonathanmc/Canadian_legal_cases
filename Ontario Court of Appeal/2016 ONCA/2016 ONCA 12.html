  <p class=Heading>Hourigan J.A.:</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 31, 2010, Lucita Charles was beaten to death by her common law husband,
    the appellant. Following the homicide, the appellant covered Ms.&nbsp;Charles
    with a blanket, tore two pages from his Bible, and pinned them to her chest
    with a knife. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant then proceeded to withdraw funds from Ms. Charless bank
    account, which he used to fund a road trip with a co-worker with whom he was
    having an affair. The two stopped to visit the co-workers parents, and after
    they left, the co-workers father called the police when his wife saw a report
    on the homicide along with the appellants picture. The police eventually
    tracked down the appellant in Oshawa, where he was arrested.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While in custody, the appellant made two statements to the police
    wherein he admitted to beating Ms. Charles to death with a hammer as she slept
    in their bedroom. He told the police that he lost it when Ms. Charles
    insisted that if she was pregnant she would have an abortion. He told the
    police that he did not mean to kill her. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of trial, the appellant pleaded guilty to manslaughter,
    but the Crown rejected his plea. The appellant advanced the defence of
    provocation, arguing that Ms. Charless firm resolve to have an abortion caused
    him, a devoutly religious man, to lose control. The trial judge held that there
    was no air of reality to the defence and refused to put it to the jury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of second degree murder. The trial judge
    ruled that he will not be eligible for parole for 15 years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing
    to give the jury an instruction in accordance with <em>R. v. W. (D.)</em>,
    [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, with respect to the exculpatory portions of his statements
    to police. He also submits that the trial judge erred in declining to instruct
    the jury on provocation. In addition, the appellant seeks leave to appeal
    sentence, arguing that his period of parole ineligibility should be reduced to
    12 years. During the course of oral submissions the appellant abandoned his
    argument relating to the admissibility of his medical records.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the conviction appeal. I
    would grant leave to appeal sentence, but I would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <em>W. (D.)</em> Instruction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issue for the jury was whether the Crown had proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellant possessed the necessary intent to be
    convicted of second-degree murder, rather than manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify at trial. He relied however, as did the
    Crown, upon two statements he had given to police. In the second, he described
    in step-by-step detail the interaction between Ms. Charles and himself the
    night of the killing and how he killed her. He claimed that he did not mean to
    do it, but lost it out of a combination of rage, depression and religious
    fervour, when faced with her intention to have an abortion if she were indeed
    pregnant. His lack of intention, as expressed in his statements to police, was
    a major focus of his defence at trial, supported by his medical records of
    previous depressive episodes when experiencing relationship difficulties. In
    addition, the appellant relied upon testimony from his father, his pastor and
    other witnesses called by the Crown as to his normally gentle and caring disposition,
    his ardent belief that his care of Ms. Charless disabled son would be rewarded
    by God providing him with a daughter, and his religious preoccupation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the appellants position, relying primarily on this courts decision in <em>R.&nbsp;v.
    Bucik</em>, 2011 ONCA 546, 274 C.C.C. (3d) 421, that the trial judges failure
    to provide the jury with a <em>W. (D.)</em> instruction, on how to consider the
    exculpatory portions of his statements to police as a source of reasonable
    doubt even if not affirmatively believed, constitutes reversible error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown concedes that an explicit <em>W. (D.)</em> warning would have been
    preferable, but submits that the omission of such an instruction does not
    constitute reversible error in the factual context of this case, where the only
    issue was whether the accused had the requisite intent for second-degree
    murder, particularly since the charge properly conveyed the burden and standard
    of proof and their application to the jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the pre-charge conference, there was some discussion between defence counsel
    and the trial judge as to whether a <em>W. (D.)</em> instruction might apply,
    and defence counsel agreed with the trial judge that the standard <em>W. (D.)</em> instruction did not really fit in the circumstances of this case. Defence
    counsel submitted that it would be appropriate to link the appellants various
    statements to the presumption of innocence and burden of proof and to make
    clear that, if there was any doubt about his intent at the time, the jury
    should acquit. The Crowns position was that a <em>W. (D.)</em> instruction was
    not required since the appellant did not testify.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the appellants argument about the <em>W. (D.)</em> instruction, it
    is important to have regard to the case law regarding the principles of
    appellate review of jury instructions. The focus of appellate review of jury
    charges is whether, after a functional and contextual review of the charge and
    of the trial as a whole, the jury instructions adequately prepared the jury for
    deliberations: <em>R. v. Araya</em>, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para.
    39. Perfection is not the test. Nor is there any requirement to exactly track
    the <em>W. (D.)</em> language: <em>R. v. B.D.</em>, 2011 ONCA 51, 266 C.C.C.
    (3d) 197, at para. 103. The key question is whether the jury was equipped with
    an understanding of the appropriate burden and standard of proof: see <em>R. v.
    King</em>, 2013 ONCA 417, 309 O.A.C. 39, at para. 16; see also <em>R. v. J.H.S.</em>,
    2008 SCC 30, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para. 13; <em>R. v. Cyr</em>, 2012 ONCA
    919, 294 C.C.C. (3d) 421, at para. 49. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the appellant relies on <em>Bucik</em> in support of its position that a <em>W.&nbsp;(D.)</em> instruction was required. However, in <em>Bucik </em>this
    court did not hold that a <em>W. (D.)</em> instruction was mandatory in
    relation to all exculpatory statements or that its absence necessarily
    constitutes reversible error. As subsequent decisions of this court have made
    clear, an explicit <em>W. (D.)</em> instruction is not necessarily required
    where there is potentially exculpatory evidence, as long as the charge as a
    whole makes the burden of proof in relation to reasonable doubt and issues of
    credibility clear to the jury, such that it is not, as described in <em>Bucik</em>,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, in <em>Bucik</em> the court was dealing with a very specific factual
    circumstance in which there were two aspects of exculpatory evidence: (i) an
    accuseds statement to the police that he was present but did not participate
    in a fatal attack, and (ii) various eyewitness inconsistencies in his
    identification which, in combination with the lack of clear evidence of the
    number of people in the vicinity at the time of the fatal attack, could give
    rise to reasonable doubt. It was particularly in the context of the
    inconsistent identification evidence that reversible error was found in a jury
    instruction that simply told the jury to consider anything the accused said,
    along with all of the other evidence, in deciding whether they had a reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge provided the jury with a comprehensive and correct
    instruction on the definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which
    included a specific reference to intent:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies to
    each and every element of the offence with which Mr. Barrett is charged. As I
    indicated to you in my opening remarks at the outset of this trial, and as
    counsel have also indicated to you in their addresses, identity and cause of
    death are not at issue in this case. The essential element that is in issue is
    the intent or state of mind: Has the Crown established beyond a reasonable
    doubt that Mr. Barrett had the requisite intent or state of mind for second-degree
    murder?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the section of the charge addressing the appellants statements to police, the
    trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>You may accept all, part or none of what Mr. Barrett told the
    police. You may give anything Mr. Barrett said as much or as little importance
    as you think it deserves in deciding this case. It is for you to say. <span
class=Underline>Anything that Mr.&nbsp;Barrett said, however, is only part of
    the evidence in this case. You should consider it along with and in the same
    way as all the other evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Some or all of the statements made by Mr.
    Barrett during the interviews may help in Mr. Barretts defence. You must
    consider those remarks that may help Mr.&nbsp;Barrett, along with all the other
    evidence. You must consider all the remarks that might help Mr. Barrett.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>If you decide that Mr. Barrett made a
    remark or remarks that may help him in his defence, you will consider that
    statement, along with the rest of his evidence, including the evidence called
    by the defence, in deciding whether you have a reasonable doubt that
    Mr.&nbsp;Barrett had the requisite intent or state of mind for murder.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>I would remind you again that the burden of proving that Mr.
    Barrett had the requisite intent for murder beyond a reasonable doubt rests on
    the Crown. That onus of proof never shifts to Mr. Barrett. There is no burden
    on Mr. Barrett to prove anything. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    addressing the indictment, and the state of mind necessary for second degree
    murder, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>You must consider all of the evidence, the sum total of it,
    along with any other evidence that seems or tends to show Mr. Barretts state
    of mind when you are deciding whether Crown counsel has proven beyond a
    reasonable doubt that Mr. Barretts unlawful killing of Lucita was murder.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>In determining this issue, you should
    consider all of the evidence. That would, of course, include what
    Mr.&nbsp;Barrett told the police during his two interviews.</span> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges section of the charge setting out the position of the defence
    commenced by stating:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In his address to you, Mr. Bawden pointed out that Patrick
    Barrett made a statement to police against the advice of his counsel. In that
    statement, Mr. Barrett honestly confessed to having killed Lucita Charles. He
    also told the investigators, You have to believe me, I didnt mean it. Mr.
    Bawden pointed out that Mr. Barretts statement is admissible both for the
    Crown and the defence. Mr. Bawden submits that when Mr. Barrett said, I didnt
    mean it, he was truthfully trying to convey the fact that he never intended to
    kill Lucita. That is his defence at this trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast to <em>Bucik</em>, in this case, the instruction to the jury put the
    entirety of the exculpatory defence evidencethe appellants denial of intentto
    the jury as something that they <em>had</em> to consider, and specifically tied
    it to the key issue. This was stronger language than used in <em>Bucik</em>.
    The jury in the present case was told they must consider all of the remarks
    that might help the appellant, along with all of the other evidence, in
    deciding whether they had a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite intent
    or state of mind for murder. Since the appellants intent was the sole issue at
    trial, it is inconceivable that the jury would not have appreciated that his
    statements that he did not mean to do it, even if not accepted in their
    entirety as true, were to be considered in determining whether they had a
    reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
    as in <em>King</em>, the charge to the jury was replete with passages
    instructing the jury that the Crown bore the burden of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt, that the burden never changed, and that the jury had to
    consider all of the evidence in deciding whether the Crown met the burden of
    proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a consideration of the jury charge as a whole demonstrates that the
    jury was properly instructed on the interplay between the exculpatory aspects
    of the appellants statements and the reasonable doubt analysis. I would, therefore,
    reject this ground of appeal.</p>

    the partial defence of provocation as enumerated in <i>R. v. Tran</i>, 2010 SCC
    58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350. She concluded that there was evidence on which the
    jury could find that Ms. Charless statement constituted an insult from the
    perspective of the appellant.</span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
lang=EN-US>In considering the objective element, the trial judge held that there
    was no air of reality because there was no evidence on which a jury might
    conclude or have a reasonable doubt that an ordinary person would be deprived
    of self-control by the words. With respect to the subjective element, the trial
    judge concluded, without reasons, that this element of the test had been met. Finally,
    considering the element of suddenness, she concluded neither the insult nor the
    reaction were sudden, as both are required to be. Based on this analysis she
    held that there was no air of reality to the defence and declined to put it to
    the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred in her analysis of the suddenness element. He argues that this case
    is not the classic situation of a grievous insult that provokes an
    instantaneous homicidal rage, but that few cases in the domestic context fall
    in this paradigm. According to the appellant, the trial judge erred in finding
    that there was no evidence that the appellant was taken by surprise by Ms.
    Charless final, unequivocal declaration of her intent to have an abortion. The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred by focusing on the length of the
    discussion and argument, rather than on the forcefulness of Ms.&nbsp;Charless
    final statement. </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> I would not accede to this argument.</span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'> </span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the
    finding of the trial judge that nothing had changed in what Ms. Charles had
    communicated to the appellant in the days and hours leading up to her death.
    She consistently told him that she would not have a child. Moreover, nothing in
    the appellants actions leading up to the attack is consistent with a sudden
    reaction. On the appellants own evidence, just before the attack, he left the
    bedroom and sat thinking while he felt the rage starting to build, then went
    out to the balcony and had a cigarette, then returned to the living room and
    flipped through his Bible, then returned to the bedroom and lay down with Ms.
    Charles, all before he attacked her. In these circumstances, it cannot
    reasonably be inferred that any insult or the appellants reaction to such
    insult was sudden. Therefore, I see no error in the trial judges analysis of
    this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;The appellant also submits that the trial
    judge did not properly take into account contextual factors in assessing the
    ordinary person test.</span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
lang=EN-US>At trial the Crown submitted that the factors to be considered
    should be limited to the appellants age, gender, the fact that he was in a
    common law relationship with a woman for two years, and that he developed
    affection for her son. The defence submitted that the factors should be
    expanded to include that he was a devout Christian, that his common-law spouse
    had two previous abortions, that he entreated her not to have a third abortion,
    the history of their relationship, and that the appellant was heavily
    invested in his common law spouses son.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the contextual factors proposed by
    the appellant are so specific to the appellant that they turn this element of
    the test into a purely subjective one. In any event, the trial judge stated in
    her reasons that she took the factors proposed by the defence into account when
    assessing the ordinary person test and, that even with these factors included, there
    was no suggestion that an ordinary person would have been deprived of
    self-control. I see no basis to interfere with that conclusion.</span></p>

    abortion could constitute an insult for the purposes of the defence of provocation.</span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'> </span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge

    act or the action of attacking; (an) attack, (an) assault. Likewise, the
    action of insulting means to [s]how arrogance or scorn; boast, exult, esp.
    insolently or contemptuously. . . . Treat with scornful abuse; subject to
    indignity; . . . offend the modesty or self-respect of.</span></p>

    Charless words simply cannot be perceived as an insultthey are an assertion
    of her intentions with respect to the pregnancyand in the context of the
    series of events, it cannot be perceived that they were used in an insulting or
    offensive way. To the contrary, the manner in which she expressed herself to
    the appellant during the course of the argument that culminated in her death was
    the antithesis of insulting or provoking; indeed, she was trying to calm him
    down so that he would leave her alone.</span></p>

    ONCA 910, 249 C.C.C. (3d) 449, at para. 179, it is hard, absent some error in
