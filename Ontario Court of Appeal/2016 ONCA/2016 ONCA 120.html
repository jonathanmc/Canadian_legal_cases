  <p class=Endorsment align=left style='text-align:left'><b>L.B. Roberts J.A.</b>:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em>Overview</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant pleaded guilty to the
    offences of dangerous driving, flight from police, breaking and entering and
    forcible confinement. He was found guilty of the offence of sexual assault, to which
    he did not plead guilty. He appeals only from that conviction. If his
    conviction appeal is allowed, he seeks leave to appeal his sentence on all his
    convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant argues on the conviction
    appeal that the trial judge erred in finding him guilty of sexual assault
    because there was no overt interference with the complainant’s sexual or bodily
    integrity. The Crown submits that the totality of the appellant’s actions
    created a violent and sexualized atmosphere that gave rise to a threat of
    sexual assault against the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>For the reasons that follow, I agree
    with the Crown’s submission. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em>Surrounding circumstances</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant’s trial proceeded on the
    basis of an uncontested statement of fact, which can be summarized briefly.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>On November 8, 2011, the appellant
    accosted the complainant, a stranger, outside her apartment door. He forced his
    way into the complainant’s apartment by using a chokehold around her neck. He
    ordered her, “Don’t f’n scream, open your door, I need to use your phone.” Once
    inside, he released her and locked the door. He started telling her about a
    police chase and drugs. He was red and sweaty. He ranted about his mistreatment
    by others. He made several telephone calls. When not on the telephone, he was
    pacing angrily and erratically between the complainant and her front door. She
    thought he was high on drugs. She was terrified. Other than the balcony, there
    was no other place for the complainant to go. The complainant sought the
    appellant’s permission to smoke cigarettes and drink tea on her balcony, which
    he allowed her to do after she brought him a drink of water.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>As the complainant was drinking her
    second cup of tea on the balcony, the appellant knocked on the balcony door and
    said to her, “Before I go, we have to have an agreement, but first I need you
    to come in and watch me masturbate.”  The complainant complied and sat down on
    the couch near the appellant while he masturbated by putting his hands down his
    pants. He did not expose his penis or touch the complainant. After a few
    minutes, the appellant asked the complainant when her husband was going to be
    home. She told him soon. By this time, the appellant had been in the
    complainant’s apartment for about an hour. The complainant feared that she
    would be raped or killed. The complainant ran out on the balcony and dove over
    the rail, falling 12 feet to the ground and breaking both her ankles.  She
    screamed for help and tried to run away.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em>Analysis</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The issue on the conviction appeal is
    whether the appellant’s action of masturbation, which he forced the complainant
    to watch in close proximity, amounts to a threat of sexual assault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The defence submits that the appellant’s
    act of masturbation does not amount to a threat of sexual assault because the
    appellant did not touch or move towards the complainant, nor was his act
    accompanied by any threatening words. The defence concedes that the appellant’s
    actions in the complainant’s apartment created a terrifying and sexualized
    atmosphere that understandably terrorized the complainant. However, his
    isolated act of masturbation cannot amount to a sexual assault because it did
    not overtly threaten the complainant’s sexual or bodily integrity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>I disagree.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>To commit a sexual assault, it was not
    necessary for the appellant to touch or even verbally threaten the complainant.
    A person’s act or gesture, without words, force or any physical contact, can
    constitute a threat to apply force of a sexual nature, if it intentionally creates
    in another person an apprehension of imminent harm or offensive contact that
    affronts the person’s sexual integrity.  Coupled with a present ability to
    carry out the threat, this can amount to a sexual assault. See </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, ss. 265(1)(b) and
    (2); </span><em>R. v. Cadden </em><span class=MsoPageNumber>(1989), 48 C.C.C.
    (3d) 122 (B.C.C.A.); and </span><em>R. v. Johnson</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2006 CanLII 37519 (Ont. S.C.).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Defence counsel argues that </span><em>Cadden</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> and </span><em>Johnson</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> are
    distinguishable in that the offences in those cases involved overt acts
    combined with verbal demands made of the victims, which are absent in the
    present case:  in </span><em>Cadden</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, a teacher
    motioned to young children to come under his desk and then told them to fellate
    or touch his penis; in </span><em>Johnson</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, the
    offender exposed his penis and, while holding a gun, ordered his victim to
    fellate him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>I would not give </span><em>Cadden</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> and </span><em>Johnson</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> this
    narrow interpretation.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>What elevates the appellant’s act of
    masturbation from an indecent act to a sexual assault are the surrounding
    circumstances of sexualized violence, control, and confinement that the
    appellant created, and to which he deliberately subjected the complainant. Those
    are the same kind of circumstances that led the courts in </span><em>Cadden</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> and </span><em>Johnson</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> to
    hold that the offenders’ actions constituted sexual assaults: see </span><em>Cadden</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, at p. 128; and </span><em>Johnson</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, at para. 152.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>On the undisputed facts of this case,
    the appellant was a violent intruder who forcibly confined the complainant to
    the restricted space of her apartment.  Over 6 feet tall and about 300 pounds,
    the appellant easily overpowered the complainant to force entry into her
    apartment. His appearance and movements were highly erratic and volatile. For
    about an hour, he controlled and dictated the complainant’s movements within
    her own apartment, physically blocking her exit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Finally, the appellant commanded the
    complainant to enter into an agreement with him before he would leave her
    apartment, which included, but was not necessarily limited to, her watching him
    commit a sexual act in close proximity. The already terrifying atmosphere
    produced by the appellant was intensified by his asking her when her husband
    would be home. The complainant was so fearful of being immediately raped or
    killed that she risked very serious injury by diving over the railing of her
    apartment balcony to escape from the appellant.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>It must be remembered that sexual
    assault is an act of power, aggression and control, and that a threat to invade
    the bodily or sexual integrity of another person or to otherwise apply force is
    itself a hostile act: </span><em>Cadden</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, at p. 128.
    The appellant intentionally terrorized the complainant for a prolonged period, in
    violent and sexualized circumstances, causing her to reasonably believe that he
