    companies (collectively, “Essar”), are under the protection of the </span><em>Companies’
    Creditors Arrangement Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as
    amended (“</span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US>”).  The Cleveland-Cliffs Iron
    Company, Cliffs Mining Company, and Northshore Mining Company (collectively,
    “Cliffs”), move for directions as to whether they require leave to appeal from
    the order of the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge, Newbould J.,
    dated January 25, 2016 (the “Order”).  Whether leave to appeal is required or
    not, Cliffs seeks a stay of the contract dispute motion Essar has brought
    against Cliffs before the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge pending
    Cliffs’ exercise of its appeal rights in respect of the Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the hearing of Cliffs’ motion for leave to appeal, or its appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the hearing of the motions, I released an
    endorsement (the “Endorsement”) in which I concluded that Cliffs required leave
    to appeal the Order and its leave to appeal motion should be expedited.  I also
    granted a stay of Essar’s contract dispute motion pending the determination of
    Cliffs’ leave to appeal motion.  These are my reasons for so ordering.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Essar manufactures steel in Sault Ste. Marie,
    Ontario.  Iron ore pellets are a key input in its manufacturing process. In
    2002, Essar’s predecessor entered into a long-term iron ore pellet supply
    contract with Cliffs (the “Contract”).    The Contract obliged Essar to
    purchase iron ore pellets exclusively from Cliffs until 2016 and to purchase a
    portion of its pellets from Cliffs from 2017 until 2024.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In recent years the business relationship
    between Essar and Cliffs has been a rocky one, with disputes arising over the quantities
    of iron ore pellets Essar was obliged to order and take up under the Contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January 2015, Cliffs filed a complaint in the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (Eastern
    District) (the “Ohio Court”) alleging that Essar had breached the Contract by
    failing to take timely delivery of iron ore pellets in the requisite amounts. 
    In late July 2015, Cliffs brought a motion for partial summary judgment. The
    motion was decided on October 7, 2015. The Ohio Court dismissed Cliffs’ motion
    for summary judgment for breach of contract relating to Essar’s 2014 quantity nomination,
    but granted its motion to dismiss Essar’s counterclaim with respect to moisture
    content. A trial of all the issues in the Ohio litigation was scheduled to
    commence on December 7, 2015.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 5, 2015, Cliffs terminated the
    Contract alleging multiple material breaches by Essar.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 9, 2015, Essar sought and obtained
    an initial order under the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US>. On November
    10, 2015, Essar’s foreign representative sought and obtained orders under
    Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C (2010) recognizing and
    enforcing in the United States the orders granted in the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> proceeding, which was recognized as the foreign main proceeding.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 11, 2015, Essar filed with the Ohio
    Court a notice that the Ohio litigation was automatically stayed in respect of
    Essar.  On December 3, 2015, the Ohio Court dismissed Cliffs’ action without
    prejudice.  As a result, the scheduled trial of Cliffs’ action did not proceed.
    Cliffs has moved to vacate that dismissal, but no decision has been rendered on
    its motion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In mid-November, Essar served a motion under s.
    11.4 of the <em>CCAA</em> seeking an order declaring Cliffs a critical supplier;
    the motion did not proceed because Essar was able to find short-term alternate
    suppliers.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On December 8, 2015, Essar moved in the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> proceeding for a declaration that Cliffs’ purported termination of
    the Contract was not effective and Cliffs must supply Essar with iron ore
    pellets at the Contract price (the “Contract Dispute Motion”).  Essar also
    sought orders directing Cliffs to comply with the Contract and to pay damages
    resulting from the purported termination of the Contract. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On December 23, 2015, Cliffs served a motion seeking
    an order dismissing Essar’s Contract Dispute Motion on the ground that the Ontario
    court lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief sought or, alternatively, Ontario is
    not the convenient forum in which to adjudicate the dispute.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Cliffs’ motion was heard on January 14, 2015 by
    Newbould J., the judge conducting the <em>CCAA</em> proceedings in respect of
    Essar. The </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge dismissed Cliffs’ motion
    in an Order and Endorsement dated January 25, 2016.  He held that the Ontario
    court has jurisdiction over Essar’s Contract Dispute Motion and Cliffs had not
    demonstrated that a clearly more appropriate forum than Ontario existed in
    which to adjudicate the dispute.</span></p>

    for a stay of the Order pending Cliff’s exercise of its appeal rights. Cliffs
    argues that it is not required to obtain leave to appeal the Order. 
    Alternatively, Cliffs submits that in the event “leave is granted from a
    portion of the decision of” the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge,
    that appeal should be consolidated “with the other aspects of the appeal which
    Cliffs has as of right.”</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether <span lang=EN-US>Cliffs Requires Leave to Appeal the
    Order </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 13 of the <em>CCAA</em> requires that
    “any person dissatisfied with an order or a decision made under this Act”
    obtain leave to appeal. The sole issue on Cliffs’ motion for directions is
    whether the Order of the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge was “made
    under” the <em>CCAA.</em> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Order resulted from a motion brought in the
    Essar <em>CCAA</em> proceeding, before the judge seized with hearing all
    matters in the Essar <em>CCAA</em> proceeding, with the judge explaining, in
    his reasons, how he was exercising his powers as a <em>CCAA</em> judge.  The
    Order bears a style of cause stating that it was made “In the Matter of the </span><em>Companies’
    Creditors Arrangement Act</em><span lang=EN-US>” in respect of a “Plan of
    Compromise or Arrangement of Essar Steel Algoma Inc.” and other companies.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nevertheless, Cliffs submits that the Order was
    not “made under” the <em>CCAA</em>, for two reasons.  First, the fact that an
    order is made “in” a <em>CCAA</em> proceeding does not necessarily mean that it
    was “made under” the <em>CCAA</em>.  Second, an order is not “made under” the <em>CCAA</em> if it is one that “could have properly been made in a normal civil action
    without any regard to the <em>CCAA</em> or the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding.” According
    to Cliffs, to constitute an order “made under” the <em>CCAA</em>, the order
    must rely upon or be grounded in a specific section of the <em>CCAA</em>. In
    support of its submissions, Cliffs relies on decisions made by Tysoe J.A. in <em>Sandvik
    Mining &amp; Construction Canada Inc. v. Redcorp Ventures Ltd.</em>, 2011 BCCA
    333, 94 C.B.R. (5th) 53, and O’Brien J.A. in <em>Monarch Land Ltd. v. Sanderson
    of Fish Creek (Calgary) Developments Ltd.</em>, 2014 ABCA 143, 575 A.R. 46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Essar submits that </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> proceedings have a wide scope.  Consequently, if </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> considerations inform the decision and exercise of discretion of
    the judge, the decision can fairly be said to be “made under” the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US>. Such considerations informed the making of the Order, so leave to
    appeal is required.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The analysis must start with an examination of the
    legislative purpose underlying the leave requirement contained in s. 13 of the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US>.  In </span><em>Hurricane Hydrocarbons Ltd. v. Komarnicki</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2007 ABCA 361, 425 A.R. 182, the Alberta Court of Appeal observed
    that the requirement for leave to appeal furthers the objects and purpose of
    the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US>.  At paras. 14 and 15, the court
    stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>To further the goal of enabling a company to deal with
    creditors in order to continue to carry on business, the&nbsp;<span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>CCAA</span>&nbsp; proceedings
    seek to resolve matters and obtain finality without undue delay…The requirement
    for leave to appeal similarly reinforces the finality of orders made under
    a&nbsp;<span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>CCAA</span>&nbsp;proceeding
    and prevents continuing litigation where there are no serious and arguable
    grounds of significance to the parties. As noted by numerous courts, delay and
    uncertainty caused by appeals is a matter of concern in a&nbsp;<span

    specific factual context in which they were made.  In <em>Sandvik Mining</em>,
    the debtor companies had secured an initial order under the <em>CCAA</em> in
    March 2009. Two months later, a judge lifted the stay of proceedings against
    certain creditors, appointed an interim receiver over some of the debtors’
    assets, and discharged the monitor from most of its duties.  A month after
    that, the debtors were assigned into bankruptcy.  Almost two years later, the
    receiver brought its application seeking a declaration regarding the ownership
    of the equipment and styled the application as one brought in the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding.  It was against that background that Tysoe J.A. stated, at para. 8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In my opinion, the order or decision of [the

    therefore, involved a case where the <em>CCAA</em> proceedings had run their
    course and failed, but the <em>CCAA</em> court file had not yet been closed.
    The receiver, “as a matter of convenience”, took advantage of that state of
    affairs to bring its application in the <em>CCAA</em> court file. The message
    from the <em>Sandvik Mining</em> decision is that where the <em>CCAA</em> proceedings have come to an end for all intents and purposes, an order made

    obtained an initial order under the <em>CCAA</em>.  In those proceedings, a
    trial of issues was directed. Prior to the trial, the list of issues was
    expanded.  As a result, the trial judge considered two issues: (i) an
    accounting for sale proceeds as between two of the secured creditors of the
    debtors; and (ii) the ownership of parking stalls pursuant to an agreement
    between the debtor and a secured creditor.</span></p>

    – dealing with the accounting between two secured creditors – O’Brien J.A.
    stated, at para. 11:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It is common ground that the accounting issue
    arises out of a Postponement and Priority Agreement, a separate and distinct
    agreement between CMI and Monarch. Monarch concedes that this determination,
    including the limitations issue, “could properly have been made in a normal
    civil action between Monarch and CMI without any regard to the CCAA”, and
    accordingly that no leave is required with respect to that part of the
    judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, O’Brien J.A. concluded that the part of
    the trial order disposing of the second issue concerning the ownership of the
    parking stalls was “made under” the <em>CCAA</em>.  Distinguishing the case
    from </span><em>Sandvik Mining</em><span lang=EN-US>, he wrote, at paras. 7 and
    8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Here the order of Horner J., the supervising
    judge in the CCAA proceedings, granted “a trial of an issue ... to determine
    whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement of December 1, 2010, between
    [Sanderson] and [Monarch] included parking stalls for the development of phase
    3 of the Sanderson project”. She lifted the stay in the CCAA proceedings
    specifically for that purpose. It is common ground that the subject Purchase
    and Sale Agreement was approved by an order made in the CCAA proceedings…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it cannot be said, as it was
    in&nbsp;<em>Sandvik</em>, that “the determination of the issue in question was
    not incidental to any order made in the CCAA”. To the contrary, the issue
    Horner J directed to trial required the interpretation of an agreement that the
    court had expressly approved in the CCAA proceedings, and involved the need to
    interpret the order approving the sale. Both interpretations had a potential
    impact upon other Sanderson’s other creditors in addition to CMI and Monarch.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, <em>Sandvik Mining</em> and <em>Monarch
    Land</em> involved circumstances which lay beyond the boundaries of the usual <em>CCAA</em> proceeding: in <em>Sandvik Mining</em></span>,<span lang=EN-US> the <em>CCAA </em>proceeding
    had run its course long before the order was made, and in <em>Monarch Land</em> an issue between two secured creditors was tacked on, as a matter of procedural
    convenience, to a trial of an issue in the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding. Consequently,
    I do not think that </span><em>Sandvik Mining’s</em> <span lang=EN-US>distinction
    between an order “made in” a <em>CCAA</em> proceeding and one “made under” the <em>CCAA</em></span> or <em><span lang=EN-US>Monarch Land’s</span></em> reference to orders that
    “could properly have been made in a normal civil action”<span lang=EN-US> offers general guidance for considering whether leave to appeal is required

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The inquiry, instead, should be purpose-focused.
    When asked to determine whether an order requires leave to appeal under s. 13
    of the <em>CCAA</em>, an appellate court should ascertain whether the order was
    made in a <em>CCAA</em> proceeding in which the judge was exercising his or her
    discretion in furtherance of the purposes of the <em>CCAA</em></span> by <span
lang=EN-US>supervising an attempt to reorganize the financial affairs of the
    debtor company, either by way of plan of arrangement or compromise, sale, or
    liquidation: <em>Century Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2010
    SCC 60, at para. 59. If the order resulted from such an exercise of judicial
    decision-making, then it is an order “made under” the <em>CCAA</em> for
    purposes of s. 13. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To aid that purpose-focused inquiry, the case
    law has identified some indicia about when an order is “made under” the <em>CCAA</em></span>. <span lang=EN-US>In <em>Sandvik Mining</em>, Tysoe J.A. stated a court should
    ask whether the order was “necessarily incidental to the proceedings under the <em>CCAA</em>”
    or “incidental to any order made under the <em>CCAA</em>”: at paras. 9 and 10. 
    In <em>Monarch Land</em>, O’Brien J.A. looked at whether the order required the
    interpretation of a previous order made in the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding or
    involved an issue that impacted on the restructuring organization of the
    insolvent companies: at paras. 8 and 15. As mentioned, in </span><em>Concrete
    Equities</em><span lang=EN-US>, </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:

    were identified by this court in </span><em>Re Hemosol Corp.</em><span

  <p class=CQuote>In our view, the proceeding before the motion judge and the

style='color:windowtext;background:white;text-decoration:none'>s. 13</span>&nbsp;and

    &nbsp;Directions were sought, amongst other things, to determine rights and
    requirements of voting in relation to the proposed plan of arrangement.
    &nbsp;There was no independent originating process to justify any other

    conclude that the Order was “made under” the <em>CCAA</em>. It was made by the
    judge supervising an active <em>CCAA</em> proceeding in furtherance of the
    purposes of the <em>CCAA</em>. The evidence before the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> judge disclosed that what, if any, rights Essar possesses under the
    Contract, which Cliffs purported to terminate on October 5, 2015, is an issue
    in the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding. </span>In <span lang=EN-US>its Sixth Report
    dated January 11, 2016, the Monitor stated that Essar is preparing a business
    plan that will form part of the information made available to potential
    purchasers or investors in its Sale and Investment Solicitation Process
    (“SISP”) recently approved under the <em>CCAA</em>.  The Monitor reported: “A
    key component of the Business Plan is Algoma’s raw material supply strategy,
    and in particular its strategy for the supply of iron ore pellets… In
    canvassing the iron ore pellet market and finalizing its supply strategy,
    Algoma needs certainty concerning the status of the Cliffs Contract.” Based on
    that and other evidence, the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge concluded,
    at para. 31, that the “</span>claim of Essar Algoma against Cliffs is an asset
    of the applicants to be dealt with in this Court.”  See also, <em>Re Montréal,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, Cliffs submits that the </span><em>CCAA </em><span

    of the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> to assume jurisdiction. In <em>Sandvik
    Mining</em></span>,<span lang=EN-US> Tysoe J.A. commented that the judge below
    had not relied on any provision of the <em>CCAA</em></span>. However, <span
lang=EN-US>it does not follow, as Cliffs submits, that an order is not “made
    under” the <em>CCAA</em> unless the judge expressly relies on a section of the
    Act in granting the order. In <em>Century Services,</em> the Supreme Court of
    Canada recognized that a judge supervising a <em>CCAA</em> proceeding will draw
    on both statutory authority under the <em>CCAA</em> and the court’s residual
    authority under its inherent and equitable jurisdiction in order to decide
    specific issues that arise during the </span><em>CCAA</em> <span lang=EN-US>proceeding.
    Deschamps J. stated, at para. 65:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I agree with Justice Georgina R. Jackson and
    Professor Janis Sarra that the most appropriate approach is a hierarchical one

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>In any event, the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge
    expressly relied on s. 11 of the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> in his
    decision on jurisdiction.  He stated, at para. 28:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The CCAA provides in section 11 that a court has jurisdiction
    to make any order “that it considers appropriate in the circumstances”. A CCAA
    court clearly has the power as per&nbsp;<em>Century Services</em>&nbsp;to make
    the procedural orders of the kind sought by Essar Algoma in this case. See
    also&nbsp;<em>Smokey River Coal Ltd., Re,</em>&nbsp;(1999),&nbsp;12 C.B.R.
    (4th) 94 (Alta. C. A.)&nbsp;at paras. 60 and 67&nbsp;per Hunt J.A. in which he
    held that a judge has the discretion under the CCAA to permit issues to be
    decided in another forum (in that case arbitration) but is under no obligation
    to do so. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span

lang=EN-US>Whether or not the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge was
    correct at law in reaching that conclusion is a matter for consideration by the
    leave to appeal panel, but is not relevant to the inquiry into the proper route
    Cliffs must follow to appeal the Order.  The </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> judge purported to rely on s. 11 of the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> in making the Order, so the Order was “made under” the </span><em>CCAA</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, Cliffs argues that because the contractual claim Essar seeks
    to assert against Cliffs could properly have been made in a normal civil action
    without regard to the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US>, the Order was not
    “made under” the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US>. I do not accept this
    submission. To decide the appeal route Cliffs must follow, the issue is not
    what claims Essar could have asserted in some hypothetical proceeding; the
    issue is how to characterize the Order – was it “made under” the </span><em>CCAA</em><span

    D.L.R. (4th) 385, at p. 334, the three-part test for obtaining a stay pending
    appeal requires the moving party to demonstrate (a) there is a serious question
    to be determined on the appeal, (b) the moving party will suffer irreparable
    harm if the stay is not granted, and (c) the balance of convenience favours
    granting the stay: </span><em>Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corp.</em><span lang=EN-US>,

    motion raises a serious question to be determined. Essar conceded as much in
    its factum when it stated that this was, at best, a “neutral factor.” And, at
    the hearing, Essar advised it was not contesting that the serious question
    factor had been satisfied. In my view, that was a proper concession to make
    given the low threshold to meet on this factor.  Cliffs’ stay motion turns on

    participated in two conference calls with the </span><em>CCAA</em><span

    Motion would be adjudicated in the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> proceeding. Counsel advised that a further videoconference call was scheduled
    to take place on Wednesday, February 17, 2016 before the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> judge at which time they expected the judge would render a decision
    on the adjudication procedure. Cliffs stated it was not participating

lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Cliffs submits that although Essar has
    undertaken not to treat Cliffs’ participation in the scheduling and
    organization of the Contract Dispute Motion as an attornment to the jurisdiction
    of the Ontario court, conflicting decisions from this court create the risk
    that such an undertaking might not be given effect, posing a serious risk to
    Cliffs’ ability to challenge the Ontario court’s jurisdiction. </span></p>

    end, Essar has proposed to Cliffs that it deliver its responding affidavit
    evidence on the dispute on “an informal, without-prejudice basis outside the
    formal bounds of these court proceedings.” Essar, in turn, would complete
    certain documentary disclosure.  Mr. Marwah provided the court with three
    undertakings in order to permit Cliffs to exercise its appeal rights while
    enabling preparation to continue on the Contract Dispute Motion:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Over the past decade, judges of this court
    sitting in Chambers on stay motions have expressed different views about whether
    a party risks attorning to the jurisdiction of the Ontario court by performing court-ordered
    procedural steps in the face of the party’s on-going challenge to the court’s jurisdiction. 
    Some decisions have viewed such participation as risking attornment, thereby
    creating some risk of irreparable harm: </span><em>M.J. Jones Inc. v. Kingsway
    General Insurance Co.</em><span lang=EN-US> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 68, 242 D.L.R.

lang=EN-US>, 2013 ONCA 388, 115 O.R. (3d) 470, at paras. 21-23, the court minimized
    any such risk from court-ordered participation, and in </span><em>Yaiguaje v.
    Chevron Corp</em><span lang=EN-US>., at para. 11, MacPherson J.A. regarded any
    risk as a weak factor in the irreparable harm analysis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I need not express a view on the effect of
    court-ordered participation in a proceeding on a party’s ability to continue to
    advance a jurisdictional challenge because decisions of this court uniformly
    have held that where the responding party provides the court with undertakings
    of the kind given by Essar in this case, the undertakings significantly reduce
    or remove the risk of irreparable harm.  </span></p>

    283 O.A.C. 321, at para. 14, Laskin J.A. described the undertakings given by
    BTR:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>BTR wants to proceed with the Ontario action.&nbsp; It is
    content to have LBIE deliver a statement of defence without filing it with the
    court.&nbsp; It undertakes not to argue that delivery of the statement of

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both parties point to some “big picture” factors
    as tipping the balance of convenience in their favour. Cliffs contends that
    Essar will not suffer any prejudice should a stay not issue because to date it has
    found sufficient quantities of replacement iron ore pellets.  As well, Essar
    did not pursue its critical supplier motion in the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> proceeding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On its part, Essar stresses the need for an
    expedited determination of the contract dispute in light of the end of April
    deadline for bids under the SISP process. Essar also advises that the Chapter
    15 court in Delaware has deferred Cliffs’ motion to lift the </span><em>CCAA</em><span
lang=EN-US> stay until the jurisdiction issue is resolved.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although these factors are relevant to the
    determination of which party will suffer the greater harm from the granting or
    refusal of a stay, in my view the most significant factor is much narrower in
    scope.  While the parties did not file on this stay motion the procedural
    proposals they have presented to the </span><em>CCAA</em><span lang=EN-US> judge, Essar advises that neither proposal contemplates Cliffs delivering any
    materials over the next two weeks. Instead, during that time Essar will be
    required to deliver certain productions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In those circumstances, the balance of
    convenience favours granting a stay. I have ordered Cliffs’ leave to appeal
    motion to be expedited.  As a result, within the next two weeks the leave motion
    will be placed before a panel of this court for determination. If leave is not
    granted, the Contract Dispute Motion can proceed on the merits with little
    delay in preparation having occurred. If leave to appeal is granted, then the
    leave panel will consider whether or not to continue the stay.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><em>BTR Global</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    Laskin J.A. stated, at para. 16, that the three components of the stay test “are
    interrelated in the sense that the overriding question is whether the moving
    party has shown that it is in the interests of justice to grant a stay.” In my
    view, the most significant factor affecting the interests of justice is the
    balance of convenience.  It favours granting a stay.  I therefore granted a
    stay in the terms set out in para. 3 of the Endorsement:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>As to that part of Cliffs’ motion which seeks a stay of Essar’s
    contract motion before the <em>CCAA</em> judge pending its exercise of appeal
    rights in respect of the Order, I grant a stay of Essar’s contract motion until
    such time as the panel of this court disposes of Cliffs’ motion for leave to
    appeal.  If the panel grants leave to appeal, the panel may consider whether or
    not to continue the stay based upon the stay motion materials already filed
    with the court.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having granted a stay, I went on to state in
    para. 4 of the Endorsement:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Of course, nothing in this endorsement prevents Cliffs from
    voluntarily taking steps to prepare for an adjudication of the contract dispute
    with Essar, without prejudice to its argument that the Superior Court of
    Justice of Ontario lacks the jurisdiction to adjudicate that dispute. As part
    of such voluntary steps, it is always open to Cliffs to request, on a
    voluntary, without prejudice basis, the informal assistance of the <em>CCAA</em> judge on any hearing planning or preparation issues, and it is always open to
    the <em>CCAA</em> judge to provide any such requested informal assistance on a
    without prejudice basis.</p>
