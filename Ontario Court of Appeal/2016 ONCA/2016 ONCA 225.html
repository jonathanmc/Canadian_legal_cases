  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This motion considers the somewhat awkward and
    anachronistic appeal provisions contained in s. 193 of the </span><em>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “</span><em><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>BIA</span></em><span lang=EN-US>”). A.
    Farber &amp; Partners Inc. was appointed receiver of the property of Bending
    Lake Iron Group Limited (the “Debtor”) pursuant to s. 243(1) of the </span><em>BIA</em><span
lang=EN-US>. The Receiver moves for directions whether the Debtor requires
    leave to appeal under s. 193(e) of the </span><em>BIA</em> <span lang=EN-US>from
    the approval and vesting order made by the motion judge on January 8, 2016,
    2016 ONSC 199, transferring all the Debtor’s property to an unrelated
    purchaser, Legacy Hill Resources Ltd. (“Legacy Hill”). At the conclusion of the
    hearing, I held that the Debtor did require leave to appeal and set a timetable
    for its leave motion.  These are my reasons for so ordering.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>HISTORY OF THE RECEIVERSHIP</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The Debtor went into receivership on September
    11, 2014 on the application of its secured creditor, 2403177 Ontario Inc. (the
    “Receivership Order”). The Debtor’s major asset is an undeveloped iron ore mine
    site located northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> By order dated November 27, 2014, the court
    approved a Sales and Investor Solicitation Process for the Debtor’s property (the
    “SISP Order”). Significantly, the Debtor consented to the SISP Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> In November 2015, the Receiver moved for court
    approval of an asset purchase agreement it had entered into with Legacy Hill
    for substantially all of the Debtor’s property (the “Sale Agreement”).  The
    Debtor opposed the motion and, in turn, brought its own motion seeking a
    variety of relief, including the postponement of the sale of its property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>  The motion judge approved the Sale Agreement
    and ordered the vesting of the Debtor’s property in Legacy Hill upon the filing
    of a receiver’s certificate (the “Approval and Vesting Order”). As well, the
    motion judge dismissed the Debtor’s motion to postpone the sale and for other
    relief.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The Debtor filed a notice of appeal dated
    January 13, 2016 seeking to set aside the Approval and Vesting Order. Section
    195 of the </span><em>BIA</em><span lang=EN-US> provides that all proceedings
    under an order appealed from are stayed until the appeal is disposed of.
    However, the Debtor did not perfect its appeal within the time required by the </span><em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em><span lang=EN-US>, and this court has issued a notice of
    intention to dismiss the appeal for delay unless it is perfected by March 22,
    2016.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>  Legacy Hill is not prepared to close the Sale
    Agreement until the Debtor has exhausted its appeal rights in this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The Receiver moves for a declaration that the
    Debtor requires leave to appeal. Granting such relief would quash the Debtor’s
    existing notice of appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>III.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE ON THE MOTION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The central issue on this motion is whether the
    Approval and Vesting Order falls into any of the categories of cases identified
    in s. 193 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>BIA</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> in which an appeal lies as of right to this court, or whether the
    Debtor must obtain leave to appeal under s. 193(e). Section 193 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>BIA</span></em><span lang=EN-US> provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>Unless otherwise expressly provided, an
    appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from any order or decision of a judge of the
    court in the following cases:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>(a)</span><span lang=EN>&nbsp;if the
    point at issue involves future rights;</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>(b)</span><span lang=EN>&nbsp;if the
    order or decision is likely to affect other cases of a similar nature in the
    bankruptcy proceedings;</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>(c)</span><span lang=EN>&nbsp;if the
    property involved in the appeal exceeds in value ten thousand dollars;</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>(d)</span><span lang=EN>&nbsp;from
    the grant of or refusal to grant a discharge if the aggregate unpaid claims of
    creditors exceed five hundred dollars; and</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>(e)</span><span lang=EN>&nbsp;in any
    other case by leave of a judge of the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Debtor submits that the Approval and Vesting
    Order falls within ss. 193(a), (b), and (c), and therefore an appeal lies as of
    right.  I shall consider the Debtor’s submissions on each sub-section in turn.</span></p>
  <h1>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SECTION 193(a): DOES THE APPROVAL AND VESTING ORDER INVOLVE FUTURE

    seeking a finding that the Receiver has violated the Crown’s fiduciary duty to
    Aboriginal Peoples, as well as the Honour of the Crown, such duties being owed

    of yet.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The future rights of the “affected Aboriginal

    is required of the evidence the Debtor placed before the motion judge on the
    sale approval motion about “affected Aboriginal communities” and of the relief the
    Debtor plans to seek in a further motion before the motion judge.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Debtor’s evidence concerning “affected
    Aboriginal communities”</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Henry Wetelainen, the President and CEO of
    the Debtor, swore an affidavit which was filed in opposition to the Receiver’s
    motion to approve the Sale Agreement. In it, he deposed that, in early 2015,
    after the Receivership Order had been made, he held discussions with Legacy
    Hill about a possible “partnership/co-operative development in rescuing [the
    Debtor] from receivership.” He described his discussions with Legacy Hill as
    attempts to attract a financial partner to assist in the refinancing of the
    Debtor in order to terminate the Receivership.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At various points in his affidavit, Mr.
    Wetelainen stated he had pursued those discussions as part of his “continued
    efforts on behalf of [the Debtor] and its creditors, shareholders, stakeholders
    and affected Aboriginal communities.” He deposed that the termination of the
    receivership would have a “concurrent benefit to [the Debtor], its creditors,
    shareholders, stakeholders and affected Aboriginal communities.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite having pursued discussions with Legacy
    Hill in early 2015, Mr. Wetelainen opposed the Sale Agreement. He took the
    position that Legacy Hill had breached a fiduciary duty owed to the Debtor by
    dealing with the Receiver. Frankly, it is difficult to understand that position
    given that under the Receivership Order and the SISP Order, Mr. Wetelainen, as
    an officer of the Debtor, was not permitted to pursue the discussions he did with
    Legacy Hill without the knowledge and concurrence of the Receiver.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, Mr. Wetelainen’s evidence
    disclosed that the main reason he opposed the Sale Agreement was that he wanted
    more time for the Debtor to find financing to take out its secured creditors
    and terminate the receivership. In his affidavit, he explained why the Debtor
    was seeking orders to postpone approval of the Sale Agreement:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Orders being sought from the Court will
    ensure that all of the creditors, shareholders, stakeholders and affected
    Aboriginal communities be given an appropriate period of time pursuant to Court
    Order to permit [the Debtor] to complete the Corporate requirement for the
    purpose of providing the creditors, shareholders, stakeholders and affected
    Aboriginal communities to invest in Special Shares in [the Debtor] in order to
    retire the debt that [the applicant] has agreed to reduce to the amount as
    reflected in the Assets Purchase Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The net result of the successful refinancing
    of [the Debtor] will be that all the shareholders will have their share value
    protected and [the Debtor] will be required to deal with unsecured creditors in
    a fair fashion.  At all times during the financing proceedings with [Legacy
    Hill], I anticipated that there would be a compromise with respect to the
    amount of debt owed to the Applicant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In Mr. Wetelainen’s view, the Sale Agreement is
    a “disasterous agreement that will wipe out millions of dollars of shareholder
    value, creditor obligations to stakeholders and various Aboriginal
    communities.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A further reason given by Mr. Wetelainen for his
    opposition to the Receiver’s sale was that an asset purchase by Legacy Hill ran
    “a very substantial risk of [Legacy Hill] alienating all of the affected
    Aboriginal communities as well as the members of the communities where a
    workforce would have been drawn from and whose cooperation would have been
    received. The Aboriginal Employment Preferences Policy identifies these clearly
    articulated goals.”</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>C.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Debtor’s pending motion</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Debtor intends to bring a motion before the
    motion judge at the end of May seeking an order that it be granted leave to
    commence an action against the Receiver “for damages as a result of the failure
    of the Receiver to uphold the honour of the Crown and the Crown’s fiduciary
    duties to Aboriginal peoples including the Aboriginal communities affected by
    the actions of the Receiver.” In its notice of motion, the Debtor asserts it
    had provided “continual notice” to the Receiver that Aboriginal communities
    were directly affected by the receivership, yet the Receiver failed to maintain
    the honour of the Crown by not notifying affected Aboriginal communities of its
    intention to seek a sale of the Debtor’s assets.</span></p>

    193(b) possesses several anachronistic features.  First, while permitting an

    proceeding might appear to foster the efficient conduct of insolvency
    proceedings, in reality any automatic appeal right will slow down insolvency
    proceedings which usually operate on a “real-time” basis. As well, the language
    of s. 193(b) does not measure the overall significance of the issue to the
    proceeding – minor issues which might arise again are treated in the same
    fashion as major ones. Finally, most contemporary insolvency litigation sees
    one judge assigned to manage the proceeding from its inception to its end.
    Under a “one judge” model of case management, common or repeat issues tend to
    get grouped together for adjudication at one time, not at different stages of

    exists, then, as the Manitoba Court of Appeal noted, at para. 7, in </span><em>Re
    Dominion Foundry Co.</em><span lang=EN-US>, an appeal as of right would exist
    in almost every case because very few insolvency cases would involve property that
    did not exceed the statutory threshold. Blair J.A. repeated that concern in </span><em><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Business Development Bank of Canada v. Pine
    Tree Resorts Inc.</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 17. By contrast, a
    challenge to a sales approval and vesting order obtained by a debtor company
    under the </span><em>CCAA </em><span lang=EN-US>would require obtaining leave
    to appeal under s. 13 of that Act.  </span></p>

    apparent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these contextual factors militate against employing an expansive
    application of the automatic right of appeal contained in s. 193(c) and,
    instead, point to the need for an approach which is alive to and satisfies the
    needs of modern, “real-time” insolvency litigation. I shall employ such an
    approach in applying the following three principles that have emerged from the jurisprudence:
    s. 193(c) does not apply to (i) orders that are procedural in nature, (ii) orders
    that do not bring into play the value of the debtor’s property, or (iii) orders
    that do not result in a loss.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Is the order procedural in nature?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The caselaw holds that s. 193(c) of the <em>BIA</em> does not
    apply to decisions or orders that are procedural in nature, including orders
    concerning the methods by which receivers or trustees realize an estate’s
    assets.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:
200%'>Re Dominion Foundry Co.</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, the motion judge
    had dismissed a request to set aside a sale of assets by a trustee in
    bankruptcy on the grounds that the sale was improvident and the trustee had
    acted improperly. The Manitoba Court of Appeal held, at para. 20, that although
    the sale involved assets whose value exceeded the statutory threshold, an order
    concerning the method by which the trustee disposed of assets did not fall
    within s. 193(c). Consequently, where a person seeks to challenge an order on
    appeal by calling into question the methods </span>employed by a trustee to
    dispose of the assets of the bankrupt, the order involves a matter of procedure
    which does not fall within s. 193(c).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Alberta Court of Appeal reached a similar
    result in </span><em>Alternative Fuel Systems Inc. v. EDO (Canada) Ltd. (Trustee
    of)</em><span lang=EN-US>.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[21]</span></span></span></a> There, the trustee had invited tenders for the purchase of the bankrupt’s
    equipment. When tenders closed, the trustee determined that Alternative’s
    tender was the highest. Once another tenderer, Impco Technologies Inc., found
    out that it was not the highest bidder, it submitted a second tender offering
    substantially more than Alternative.  The trustee sought directions from the
    court.  The bankruptcy judge directed the trustee to accept Impco’s second,
    higher tender. Alternative filed a notice of appeal and moved before the
    Alberta Court of Appeal for a determination that it could appeal as of right
    under s. 193(c) because the value of the property involved exceeded the
    statutory threshold.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>O’Leary J.A., following </span><em>Re Dominion
    Foundry Co.</em><span lang=EN-US>, held that Alternative had no right of appeal
    under s. 193(c). He reasoned, at para. 12, that the bankruptcy judge’s order
    was essentially a procedural direction to the trustee in the face of
    Alternative’s challenge to the method by which the equipment was sold,
    by-passing the tender process. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, the overwhelming majority
    of the Debtor’s grounds of appeal are process-related, involving issues
    concerning the Debtor’s dealings with Legacy Hill following the Receivership
    Order, the Receiver’s disclosure of information about the Sale Agreement, the
    negotiation process it followed with Legacy Hill, its treatment of persons
    affected by the Sale Agreement, and the adequacy of notice it gave to “affected
    Aboriginal communities.” Those grounds of appeal are procedural in nature and
    do not fall within s. 193(c).</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Does the order put into play the value of the
    Debtor’s property?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second principle emerging from the caselaw
    is that s. 193(c) is not engaged where the decision or order does not call into
    play the value of the debtor’s property. In </span><em><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%'>Business Development Bank of Canada v. Pine Tree
    Resorts Inc.,</span></em><span lang=EN-US> Blair J.A. considered whether an
    order appointing a receiver over assets of debtor corporations that exceeded
    $10,000 in value fell within s. 193(c). He concluded that it did not stating,
    at para. 17, that “an order appointing a receiver does not bring into play the
    value of the property; it simply appoints an officer of the court to preserve
    and </span>monetize those assets<span lang=EN-US>, subject to court approval.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, the Approval and Vesting
    Order marked the final step in the Receiver’s monetization of the Debtor’s assets.
    The property of the Debtor is to be converted through the Sale Agreement into a
    pool of cash and, as stated in the Approval and Vesting Order, “the net
    proceeds from the sale of the Purchased Assets shall stand in the place and
    stead of the Purchased Assets.” The ground of appeal advanced by the Debtor to
    the effect that the sale process should be postponed to let shareholders re-finance
    the company does not bring into play the value of the Debtor’s property, so s.
    193(c) does not apply.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Does the order result in a gain or loss?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, for s. 193(c) to apply, the order in
    question must contain some element of a final determination of the economic
    interests of a claimant in the debtor. In </span><em><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US> Paperny J.A. described this aspect of s. 193(c) at para. 8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The test to be applied under this section was
    originally articulated in <em>Orpen v Roberts</em>,&nbsp;[1925] SCR 364&nbsp;at

    which set out that the amount or value of the matter in controversy is the loss
    which the granting or refusal of that right would entail.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Approval and Vesting Order did not determine
    the entitlement of any party with an economic interest in the Debtor to the
    sale proceeds.  In that sense, no interested party gained or lost as a result
    of the order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, one ground of appeal set out in the
    Debtor’s notice of appeal is that the motion judge erred in law in finding that
    the Receiver had not acted improvidently. In its factum, the Debtor contends
    that the Receiver’s sale of its property is improvident because it would result
    in a loss of $125 million to its shareholders. In support of that ground of
    appeal, on this motion the Debtor relied on a memo prepared by Broad Oak
    Associates dated February 3, 2014, half a year before the Receivership Order
    was made. Using an iron ore pellet price of US$100 per tonne, Board Oak placed
    the value of a fully-developed Bending Lake iron ore project in the range of
    US$100 million to $300 million. This, the Debtor argues, shows that the
    Approval and Vesting Order selling its undeveloped mine site assets resulted in
    a loss to shareholders of an amount exceeding $10,000 in value, giving it a
    right to appeal under s. 193(c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept the Debtor’s submission. The
    determination of whether “the property involved in the appeal exceeds ten
    thousand dollars” is a fact-specific one. In order to bring itself within s.
    193(c), the Debtor must do more than make a bald allegation of improvident
    sale.  This is real-time insolvency litigation in which delays in the
    proceeding can prejudice the amounts fetched by a receiver on the realization
    process.  The Debtor must demonstrate some basis in the evidentiary record considered
    by the motion judge that the property involved in the appeal would exceed in
    value $10,000, in the sense that the granting of the Approval and Vesting Order
    resulted in a loss of more than $10,000 because the Receiver could have
    obtained a higher sales price for the Debtor’s property. Bald assertion is not
    sufficient, otherwise a mere bald allegation of improvident sale in a notice of
    appeal could result in an automatic stay of a sale approval order under </span><em>BIA</em><span
lang=EN-US> s. 195 as the appellant pursues its appeal.<a href="#_ftn23"

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neither the Debtor nor its shareholders put
    before the motion judge a valuation of the Debtor made near in time to the
    execution of the Sale Agreement. Mr. Wetelainen did not attach the pre-receivership
    Broad Oak memo to the affidavit he placed before the motion judge. By contrast,
    the Receiver reported to the motion judge that the market price of iron ore had
    declined to the mid-US$50 per tonne range, making a court sanctioned sales
    process “very challenging in the current market conditions.” The market price for
    iron ore reported by the Receiver was far below the pre-receivership assumptions
    used by Broad Oak. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor did Mr. Wetelainen depose on the sale
    approval motion that the Debtor’s property was worth over $100 million.
    Instead, in his affidavit he stressed the need to postpone the sale to allow
    the Debtor’s shareholders time to negotiate a compromise of the secured debt
    and then pay off the compromised debt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the Debtor’s secured lenders supported

    persuaded that there is any evidentiary basis to the Debtor’s bald assertion in
