  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At issue on this appeal is whether the application judge erred in

style='letter-spacing:1.8pt'> “</span>accident”,<span style='letter-spacing:

    3(1)<span style='letter-spacing:2.65pt'> </span>of the <em>Statutory Accident
    Benefits Schedule – Effective September 1, 2010</em>, O. Reg. 34/10 (the “<em>SABS</em>”),<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    seminal case on the definition of accident is <em>Amos</em>. In that case, the
    appellant was attacked by a gang while driving and was seriously injured when
    shot. At issue was whether the appellant was eligible for benefits under the British
    Columbia regulation, which provided for the payment of benefits “in respect of
    death or injury caused by an accident that arises out of the ownership, use or
    operation of a vehicle…”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Amos</em> the Supreme Court articulated, at para. 17, the following
    two-part test in interpreting the section in issue:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. Did the accident result from the ordinary and well-known
    activities to which automobiles are put?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. Is there <span class=Underline>some</span> nexus or causal
    relationship (not necessarily a direct or proximate causal relationship)
    between the appellant's injuries and the ownership, use or operation of his
    vehicle, or is the connection between the injuries and the ownership, use or
    operation of the vehicle merely incidental or fortuitous?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This two-part test summarizes the case law interpreting the
    phrase &quot;arising out of the ownership, use or operation of a vehicle&quot;,
    and encompasses both the &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;causation&quot; tests
    posited in the jurisprudence. [Emphasis in original.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, as a consequence of amendments to the <em>SABS</em>, the causation
    test was modified by this court in <em>Greenhalgh</em> and <em>Martin</em>. Pursuant
    to this modified causation test, the insured must first establish that the use
    or operation of an automobile was the cause of the injuries. If that is
    established, the insured must then satisfy the court there was no intervening
    act(s) that resulted in the injuries that cannot be said to be part of the
    course of the “ordinary course of things”. The question is whether it can be
    said that the use or operation of the vehicle was a “direct cause” of the
    injuries: <em>Greenhalgh</em>, at paras. 36 and 38; <em>Martin</em>, at para.
    37. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Amos</i> test was considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Citadel General
    Assurance Co. v. Vytlingam</em>, 2007 SCC 46, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 373. In that
    case, the insureds were driving on a highway when their vehicle was struck by a
    large boulder dropped from an overpass. The insureds received no-fault benefits
    and also sought to recover damages from their insurer pursuant to the
    inadequately insured motorist coverage found in s. 3 of the Ontario Policy
    Change Form 44R. Under this endorsement, an insurer is obliged to “indemnify an
    eligible claimant for the amount that he or she is legally entitled to recover from
    an inadequately insured motorist as compensatory damages in respect of bodily
    injury to…an insured person arising directly or indirectly from the use or
    operation of an automobile.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Citadel</em><i>,</i> the court found that the “relaxed” causation test in <em>Amos</em> was inapplicable because the claim was for indemnification and <em>Amos</em> involved a claim for no-fault benefits. In the course of his analysis, Binnie
    J., writing for the court, provided guidance with respect to the scope of the
    purpose test, at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Secondly, and in any event, the appellant insurer’s argument
    overstates the scope of the<i> </i><em>Amos</em> purpose test.&nbsp; The
    “ordinary and well-known activities to which automobiles are put” limits
    coverage to motor vehicles being used as motor vehicles, and would exclude use
    of a car as a diving platform (as above) or retiring a disabled truck to a barn
    to store dynamite (which explodes), or negligently using the truck as a
    permanent prop to shore up a drive shed (which collapses, injuring
    someone).&nbsp; In none of these cases could it be said that the tortfeasor was
    at fault as a motorist.&nbsp; In none of these cases could it be said that the
    motor vehicle was being used as a motor vehicle.&nbsp; That is the sort of
    aberrant situation that the <em>Amos</em> purpose test excludes, and nothing
    more.&nbsp; Here, as in <em>Amos</em>, it is the causation test that did the
    work, not the purpose test.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does
    parking a vehicle constitute the type of aberrant use contemplated by the
    Supreme Court in <em>Citadel</em>? In my view, it does not. The examples cited
    by Binnie J. were limited to circumstances in which a vehicle is not being used
    as a vehicle but for some other purpose. Parking a vehicle is not aberrant to
    its use as a vehicle. A vehicle is designed to be parked. Indeed, it is safe to
    say that most vehicles are parked the most of the time. I would conclude,
    therefore, that parking a vehicle is an ordinary and well-known activity to
    which vehicles are put.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the application judge made a series of errors in his
    analysis of the purpose test. I deal with each of these arguments in turn
    below. In my view, they do not change the result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first and primary argument advanced by the appellant is that the application
    judge erred in failing to conclude that there must be an active use of the
    vehicle to meet the purpose test. It argues that the motorcycle in this case
    was no longer in use and had essentially been abandoned. Thus, the motorcycle
    was nothing more than the venue for the incident, in the same way a tree trunk
    would be if someone tripped over it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on <em>Martin</em> in support of this venue argument. It also
    cites <em>Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company v. Prest</em>, 2013 ONSC
    92, [2013] I.L.R. I-5385, for the proposition that a parked car is no longer in
    use. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument is misconceived. There is no active use component in the purpose test.
    The sole question for determination under that test is whether the incident in
    issue resulted “from the ordinary and well-known activities to which
    automobiles are put”. While the active use of an automobile (e.g. driving)
    would qualify under this test, there is no requirement that the vehicle be in
    active use. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, under the causation test, the use to which a vehicle is being put is
    an important component of the analysis. In <em>Martin</em>,<i> </i>the
    causation test was in issue, not the purpose test. In that case, the insured
    sought <em>SABS</em> benefits after being assaulted by two assailants in a parking
    lot and forced into the trunk of his car. This court held that the motion judge
    erred in failing to consider all of the elements of the modified causation
    test. Justice Cronk, writing for the court, expressed reservation as to whether
    the first branch of the modified causation test had been met, noting that the
    vehicle was nothing more than the venue where many of the assaults occurred, at
    para. 38. Thus, as submitted by the respondent, venue is a counterpoint to
    causation and has nothing to do with the purpose test. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s reliance on <em>Prest</em> is also misplaced. <em>Prest</em><i> </i>was
    a very brief endorsement in circumstances in which the insured parked his car
    in a parking garage to wash it and then tripped over a concrete curb sticking
    out from the wall, suffering an injury. The insured stated that his right hand
    was touching the car when he tripped. The court concluded that neither the
    purpose test nor the causation test was satisfied. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court asked the correct question: whether the incident arose from the ordinary
    and well-known activities to which automobiles are put. However, at para. 8, its
    one paragraph analyzing the purpose test, the court stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>In my view, on the facts of this
    matter, it does not.&nbsp; At the time of the incident the vehicle was being
    neither used nor operated.&nbsp; To the contrary, the vehicle was parked in its
    regular parking spot for purposes of washing the car.&nbsp; A parking spot at
    one’s residence is typically where a car is put when there is no intent to use
    it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no reference in this analysis to the guidance from the Supreme Court in <em>Citadel</em>.
    Moreover, the application judge wrongly equated the active use of a vehicle
    with the ordinary and well-known activities to which vehicles are put. Consequently,
    there is no consideration of whether the purpose test could be satisfied if a
    vehicle is parked and not in active use. Given these weaknesses in the court’s
    analysis, this case is of no assistance in determining whether the purpose test
    has been satisfied in the case at bar. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant submits that the application judge erred in finding that the
    motorcycle was parked temporarily on the walkway when the appellant tripped.
    According to the appellant, there was no evidence to support this finding and
    the application judge also impermissibly imported a temporal element into the
    purpose test. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree. The application judge did not err in finding, at para. 13, that there
    was no evidence that the motorcycle was inoperable or that it was being stored
    at the campsite for an extended period of time. To the contrary, the evidence
    established that the motorcycle arrived the same day as other campers and was
    parked at the campsite. It was reasonable to infer that the motorcycle would
    leave after the jamboree, if not be used before. I also do not read the
    application judge’s reasons as importing a temporal element into the purpose
    test. Rather, he was simply analyzing the facts in determining whether parking
    a motorcycle is an ordinary and well-known activity to which motorcycles are
    put.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    I accept the appellant’s submission that the application judge erred, at para.
    18 of his endorsement, when he concluded that the respondent had “satisfied the
    purpose test that the use or operation of an automobile, i.e., the motorcycle,
    was involved in this incident.” The purpose test is not designed to determine
    whether a vehicle is involved in an incident. However, when this statement is
    read in context, I am satisfied that the application judge understood the
    elements of the purpose test and that this misstatement did not affect his
    analysis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    I also agree with the appellant that the application judge should not to have
    relied on the liability sections of the Ontario Automobile Policy (O.A.P. 1) in
    support of his analysis, at para. 17. Liability can be triggered by mere
    ownership of a vehicle so the analogy to those provisions was not apt. Again,
    however, I am not satisfied that this affected the application judge’s analysis.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. The respondent, as the
    successful party, is entitled to his costs of the appeal, which I would fix at
    $15,000, inclusive of all fees, disbursements, and applicable taxes. </p>
