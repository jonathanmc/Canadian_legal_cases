  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:

    in the context of a class action against a franchisor. The franchisor, Pet Valu
    Canada Inc. (“Pet Valu”), moved for summary judgment on the 7 common issues
    certified in the class action. The motion judge granted judgment in favour of
    Pet Valu dismissing common issues 1-5. He invited the plaintiff, 1250264
    Ontario Inc. (the “plaintiff”), to move to amend its statement of claim and add
    an 8th common issue. The plaintiff accepted that invitation and the motion
    judge deferred his decision on common issues 6 and 7 until the plaintiff’s
    motion was heard. While the motion judge ultimately dismissed the plaintiff’s
    motion to amend and add an 8th common issue on the ground of prejudice, he read
    language into the court-established wording of common issue 6. On the basis of
    the read-in language, he then found that Pet Valu had breached its duty of fair
    dealing under s. 3 of the </span><em>Arthur Wishart Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> <i>(Franchise Disclosure), 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 3
    (the “</span><em>AWA</em><span style='line-height:200%'>”) and answered common
    issues 6(i), (iii) and (iv) in favour of the plaintiff. Common issue 7 – damages
    – has not yet been determined.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Pet Valu appeals the motion
    judge’s decision answering common issues 6(i), (iii) and (iv) in favour of the
    plaintiff. It argues that the motion judge erred by what it characterizes as
    unilaterally and unfairly amending common issue 6. It also argues that the
    motion judge made several errors in finding that it breached s. 3 of the </span><em>AWA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. The plaintiff cross-appeals the motion judge’s dismissal
    of its motion to amend to add an 8th common issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons that follow, I
    would allow Pet Valu’s appeal, find in favour of Pet Valu on common issues
    6(i), (iii) and (iv) and dismiss the plaintiff’s cross-appeal. Given that I
    would find in favour of Pet Valu on common issues 6(i), (iii) and (iv), there
    is no need to answer common issue 7, which deals with the damages Pet Valu
    would have been required to pay if the plaintiff had succeeded on common issue
    6. In the result, I would dismiss the plaintiff’s action against Pet Valu. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    background, including the events leading to and a summary of the decision under
    appeal. I then proceed to the analysis that leads me to conclude that the motion
    judge did not err in dismissing the plaintiff’s motion to amend. Next, I set
    out the analyses leading to my conclusions that the motion judge, in effect,
    improperly amended common issue 6 and erred in concluding that Pet Valu
    breached s. 3 of the </span><em>AWA</em><span style='line-height:200%'>.</span></p>

    retailer of pet food, supplies, and related services. It has almost 300

    United States. </span></p>

    franchisee. He sold his franchise at a considerable profit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff commenced an action against Pet Valu alleging, among other
    things, that Pet Valu had not shared volume rebates it received from suppliers
    with franchisees. The action was certified as a class action on June 29, 2011.
    The class consists of about 150 former Pet Valu franchisees. In reasons
    released January 14, 2011, the certification judge concluded that the only
    claim advanced by the plaintiff that was appropriate for certification was its
    claim in relation to the volume rebates: <em>1250264 Ontario Inc. v. Pet Valu
    Canada Inc.</em>, 2011 ONSC 287, at para. 4. </p>

    upon the wording of the common issues and, after a further hearing, the
    certification judge released reasons on March 28, 2011 defining “Volume
    Rebates” and setting out the seven common issues in relation to the volume rebates
    claim included in Schedule A to these reasons: </span><em>1250264 Ontario Inc.
    v. Pet Valu Canada Inc.</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, 2011 ONSC 1941.
    The certification judge wrote, at paras. 3 and 4:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>My objective is to state common issues that fairly reflect the
    pleadings, the evidentiary record and the conclusions in my reasons. The common
    issues should be clear, neutrally-worded and fair to both parties. They should
    be phrased in such a way that their answers will advance the litigation.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To serve these ends, the common issues should not be framed in
    overly broad terms. Nor should they be framed in overly narrow terms in a way
    that unreasonably constrains the ability of either party to prove or disprove
    the common issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    certification judge added, at para. 8:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, the term should be defined. I used the term
    &quot;Volume Rebates&quot; in my reasons, for convenience and for definitional
    purposes. I made findings, however, at paras. 20 and 21, based on Pet Valu's
    own documentation, that Pet Valu received rebates, allowances, discounts and
    other negotiated price reductions from suppliers. Based on my reasons, and the
    evidence, it seems to me that the following is an appropriate definition that
    includes those items which, on the evidence, were granted to the defendant by
    suppliers and manufacturers as a result of its volume purchasing:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>&quot;Volume Rebates&quot; means all
    volume-based rebates, allowances and discounts given by suppliers and
    manufacturers to Pet Valu or its affiliates and includes any direct or indirect
    discounts of the price at which goods are supplied to the Pet Valu system, but
    does not include discounts tied to the performance of individual stores.</p>

    summary judgment on the seven common issues. Its motion was heard more than
    three years after the proceeding was certified. In the intervening period, a
    different judge assumed responsibility for case management of the class action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    plaintiff focused on a portion of an affidavit of Pet Valu’s CEO, Thomas
    McNeely, sworn June 16, 2014. The plaintiff submitted that the affidavit
    disclosed – for the first time – that Pet Valu had little to no purchasing
    power. The plaintiff argued that Pet Valu had misrepresented the nature and
    extent of its purchasing power. The motion judge suggested to counsel that the
    common issues be amended to add a new one, dealing specifically with the
    plaintiff’s new “focus” on purchasing power. Pet Valu did not agree to this
    suggestion. The plaintiff advised that it would move to amend the statement of
    claim and add an 8th common issue dealing with purchasing power. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The motion judge released reasons
    on October 31, 2014, dismissing common issues 1 through 5: </span><em>1250264
    Ontario Inc. v. Pet Valu Canada Inc.</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, 2014
    ONSC 6056 (the “October Reasons”). Common issue 1 asked whether Pet Valu had
    breached its contractual duty to class members by failing to share Volume
    Rebates with them. With respect to this common issue, which the motion judge
    characterized at para. 2 as the “core issue”, the motion judge wrote, at para.
    29:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>I conclude that there were no undisclosed or “phantom” rebates;
    that all of the Volume Rebates were passed on and shared with the franchisees;
    and that the franchisor’s mark-ups were not unreasonable.</p>

    that the average franchisee’s cost for products was about 15% lower than
    outside distributor’s prices and that Pet Valu negotiated the best price it
    could obtain and bestowed a range of benefits on its franchisees: at paras. 20
    and 27-28. </span></p>

    29 (the “January Reasons”). He explained, at para. 11, that the motion “was
    prompted solely by the so-called revelation in the 2014 McNeely affidavit that
    Pet Valu has ‘little to no purchasing power’”. However, the motion judge
    acknowledged, at para. 15, that he had misapprehended the McNeely affidavit: “[o]n
    a fair reading of Mr. McNeely’s 2014 affidavit, it is clear that he did not
    mean that Pet Valu had ‘little to no purchasing power’”. The motion judge

  <p class=CQuote>The defendant’s motion for summary judgment should have been

    reason for modifying common issue 6(i) at para. 60 of the January Reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Strictly speaking, the question in 6(i) does not ask whether
    the franchisor “received significant volume discounts offered by suppliers”
    (the language in proposed Common Issue 8) but whether the franchisor “receives
    volume rebates.” In my view, however, 6(i) should be interpreted as also asking
    if “significant volume discounts” were received by the franchisor. I say this
    for two reasons. First, counsel for Pet Valu have taken this position in their
    factum – that the question about “significant volume discounts” in Common Issue
    8 “duplicates” existing Common [Issue] 6 and that “Pet Valu should not have to
    face repetitive common issues.” Secondly, the more reasonable interpretation of
    Common Issue 6(i) in the context of this litigation is whether Pet Valu
    received a meaningful or significant measure of volume discounts and not just
    whether they received <i>any</i> amount, however meager.</p>

    “virtually non-existent” was a “material fact” as defined in the </span><em>AWA</em><span

    in a disclosure document that must be provided to a prospective franchisee
    before it signs the franchise agreement or any agreement relating to the
    franchise agreement or pays any consideration to the franchisor or its
    associates. If it fails to do so, the franchisee may rescind the franchise
    agreement pursuant to s. 6. The franchisee may also sue the franchisor for
    damages under s. 7(1) if it suffers a loss because of the franchisor’s failure
    to comply in any way with s. 5. The common issues that were ultimately
    certified in relation to volume rebates did not ask if Pet Valu breached its
    disclosure obligations under s. 5 or whether the class members were entitled to
    rescind the franchise agreement or to damages under s. 7.) And, the motion
    judge found, the fact that Pet Valu did not receive significant volume
    discounts was not disclosed to franchisees until August, 2012 – well into the

  <p class=CQuote>In performing its contractual obligation to share volume discounts
    on a reasonable basis, Pet Valu had to track and record the volume discounts
    and share or pass them on to the franchisees by way of pricing reductions.
    These pricing benefits, including information about the level of volume
    discounts were, to say the least, important to the franchisees. By hiding or
    refusing to disclose information about the virtual non-existence of volume
    discounts – information that was “material to the matters ultimately contracted
    for” in the franchise agreement and was clearly related to the performance of
    this agreement – Pet Valu did not deal fairly or in good faith with its
    franchisees.</p>

    his analysis at para. 41 by explaining that s. 3(1) is a codification of the
    common law, he ultimately held that a franchisor’s duty under s. 3 of the </span><em>AWA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> is broader than its common law duty, as that duty was
    articulated by the Supreme Court in </span><em>Bhasin v. Hrynew</em><span

    honesty in the performance of contractual agreements does not impose a duty of loyalty
    or disclosure. Instead, the duty imposes on the parties a “simple requirement
    not to lie or mislead the other party about one’s contractual performance.” The

    an 8th common issue, Pet Valu was in a position to obtain complete summary

    he identified how such claims might be pleaded, granted the plaintiffs leave to
    amend, and certified the action, subject to the plaintiffs amending their
    statement of claim in accordance with his framing of the questions. This court
    agreed with the Divisional Court that the class proceeding case management
    judge erred in conditionally certifying the class action in the absence of a
    statement of claim that disclosed a cause of action. The effect of his doing so

    certification judge. The court concluded that it did not. The changes proposed
    by the plaintiff did not “fundamentally [change] the nature of the case
    presented … in a way that would prejudice [the defendant]” and the defendant
    was not at any procedural disadvantage in arguing the point. It was given an

    agree. As discussed above, <span style='line-height:200%'>the motion to amend was
    prompted by the motion judge more than three years after certification and
    followed the hearing of a summary judgment motion. A</span>bsent the motion
    judge’s intervention to suggest the adding of a new common issue – which was
    based on his misunderstanding of the 2014 McNeely affidavit – the litigation
    would have concluded and the defendant would have been in a position to obtain
    complete summary judgment on the existing common issues. Certifying a new
    common issue that was fundamentally different than the issues certified more

    have concluded and Pet Valu likely would have succeeded on the summary judgment
    motion: at paras. 30-31. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Most significantly, the motion
    judge recast common issue 6(i) on his own initiative, following the completion
    of the summary judgment motion, without advising Pet Valu that he proposed to
    make this change and affording Pet Valu the opportunity to make submissions. In
    effect, he gave judgment on an issue that was never certified. Doing so was
    fundamentally unfair to Pet Valu. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At para. 60 of the January Reasons,
    the motion judge provides a summary of a submission by Pet Valu, at para. 85 of
    its responding factum, opposing the plaintiff’s motion to amend:  “the question
    about ‘significant volume discounts’ in Common Issue 8 ‘duplicates’ existing Common
    [Issue] 6”. The motion judge then relied on this as one of two reasons for
    interpreting common issue 6(i) in the manner that he did. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The submission at issue read as
    follows: “[t]he reference to a duty of disclosure regarding “volume discounts”
    duplicates existing common issues #6 and 7.” Common issue 6 asks if Pet Valu
    had a duty to disclose whether it received Volume Rebates (6(i)) and the amount
    of Volume Rebates received 6(iii)).  There is overlap, but the motion judge’s
    addition of the words “significant volume discounts” to common issue 6 had
    reaching implications that Pet Valu could not reasonably have anticipated. Pet
    Valu’s submissions would undoubtedly have been different if it were addressing
    a proposed change to the language of common issue 6, and not the proposed
    addition of another common issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    if the parties had the opportunity to make submissions, the effect of the
    addition of the words would also have been explored. Proceeding in the manner
    the motion judge did deprived him of the benefit of the parties’ submissions on
    the theory of liability he adopted in his reasons. It was not “tested in the
    crucible of the adversarial process”: <em>Labatt Brewing Company Limited v. NHL
    Enterprises Canada</em>, L.P., 2011 ONCA 511, <span style='line-height:200%'>106

style='line-height:200%'> in the absence of certified common issues asking
    those questions and in the absence of submissions by the parties on those

    representation that Pet Valu received significant volume discounts and an
    effective breach of s. 5 of the </span><em>AWA</em><span style='line-height:

    and overriding errors that Pet Valu alleges the motion judge made in finding:
    (a) that Pet Valu “rebuffed” the plaintiff’s request for information; (b) that
    volume rebates were “meagre”; and (c) that the fact that Pet Valu did not
    receive significant volume-based benefits from its suppliers was – in the
    context of the benefits that the motion judge found the franchisor did provide
    – a “material fact” as defined in the </span><em>AWA</em><span

    in finding that Pet Valu represented to franchisees that it received

    non-disclosure by a franchisor in the course of the performance or enforcement of

    the amount of Volume Rebates it received or the amount that it shared with
