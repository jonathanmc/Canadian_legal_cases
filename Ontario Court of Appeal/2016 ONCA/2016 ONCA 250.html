  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=Heading>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the G20 summit held in June 2010, demonstrations occurred at
    various locations in the City of Toronto. Police encircled or “boxed-in” groups
    at multiple locations. At three of the locations, the individuals detained were
    arrested and taken to a central Detention Centre specially constructed for the
    G20 event. The conditions at the Detention Centre were poor. Significant delays,
    overcrowding, and a breakdown in prisoner care occurred.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> In total, approximately 1,000 people were arrested or detained. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, Sherry Good, was among them. She commenced a proposed
    class action against Toronto Police Services Board (“TPS”) and three other
    defendants asserting multiple claims, including breach of her <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights and those of the putative class members. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed the plaintiff’s motion for certification of
    the proposed class proceeding under the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>,
    S.O. 1992, c. 6 (the “Act”). Before appealing to the Divisional Court, the
    plaintiff narrowed her proposed class proceeding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court set aside the order of the motion judge and
    certified the narrowed claim as two separate class proceedings. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court also awarded costs of the original certification
    motion in the all-inclusive amount of $125,728.03 in favour of the plaintiff.
    The costs awarded were significantly reduced from those sought by the plaintiff
    “to reflect the time that was spent on the unsuccessful aspects of the claim as
    originally advanced.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>TPS appeals from the order of the Divisional Court certifying the
    two proceedings and asks this court to restore the order of the motion judge. The
    plaintiff seeks leave to cross-appeal the costs awarded by Divisional Court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below, for reference, I first set out the test that must be met before
    the court will certify a class proceeding. Next, I provide an overview of the
    certification decisions of the motion judge and the Divisional Court. Then I
    set out the issues on the certification appeal and proceed to my analysis of
    those issues. Finally, I address the plaintiff’s cross-appeal of the costs
    awarded by the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span
style='line-height:200%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE TEST FOR CERTIFICATION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5(1) of the Act sets out the test that must be met before the
    court will certify a class proceeding:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>5(1) The court shall certify a class proceeding
    on a motion under section 2, 3 or 4 if,</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(a) the pleadings or the notice of application
    discloses a cause of action;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(b) there is an identifiable class of two or
    more persons that would be represented by the representative plaintiff or
    defendant;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(c) the claims or defences of the class
    members raise common issues;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(d) a class proceeding would be the preferable
    procedure for the resolution of the common issues; and</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(e) there is a representative plaintiff or
    defendant who,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(i) would fairly and
    adequately represent the interests of the class,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(ii) has produced a
    plan for the proceeding that sets out a workable method of advancing the
    proceeding on behalf of the class and of notifying class members of the
    proceeding, and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(iii) does not have,
    on the common issues for the class, an interest in conflict with the interests
    of other class members. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE MOTION
    JUDGE’S CERTIFICATION DECISION</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>3.1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>The class proceeding as
    framed before the motion judge</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the motion judge, the proposed defendants included the Attorney
    General of Canada (“Canada”), Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario
    (“Ontario”), and Regional Municipality of Peel Police Services Board (“Peel”).
    The plaintiff pleaded multiple causes of action: false imprisonment, assault
    and battery, conversion and trespass to chattels, abuse of public office,
    systemic negligence, breach of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> and discrimination under the <em>Human Rights Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff proposed a class definition with eight subclasses: one for each of
    five locations where police “boxed in” and detained individuals; one for
    individuals detained or arrested in the vicinity of Queen’s Park; a “residual”
    subclass for individuals who were arrested in relation to the G20 Summit at
    other locations and eventually released without charge; and one for individuals
    imprisoned at the Detention Centre. The class and subclasses as proposed to the
    motion judge are set out in Schedule “A”.<span style='background:yellow'> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    every cause of action was pleaded with respect to every subclass. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>3.2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>Section 5(1)(a): Cause of
    action</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    thorough and careful reasons, the motion judge applied the five-part test for
    certification in s. 5(1) of the Act. She concluded that none of the claims
    against Canada, Ontario or Peel satisfied the s. 5(1)(a) requirement that the
    pleadings disclose a cause of action. However, she found that it was not plain
    and obvious that the following claims against TPS would fail, and that they
    therefore met the first prong of the s. 5(1) test: false imprisonment; battery
    (except in relation to individuals detained at the Detention Centre); assault
    in respect of two of the five location-based subclasses; conversion and
    trespass to chattels; and the <em>Charter</em> and human rights claims.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>3.3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>Section 5(1)(b): Identifiable
    class</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that the plaintiff had not met the s. 5(1)(b) requirement of
    an identifiable class. At para. 153, she characterized the plaintiff as seeking
    to certify, as one class, eight distinct groups of claims with no common link.
    That, she held, was contrary to s. 5(2) of the Act and to applicable case law –
    in particular, <em>Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. v. Wuttunee</em>, 2009 SKCA 43, <span
class=nowrap>69 C.P.C. (6th) 60</span>, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, 2009
    CanLII 57570;  and <em>Caputo v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (2004)</span></em>, <span class=nowrap>236 D.L.R.
    (4th) 348</span> (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 45. In her view, the only proposed
    common issue that applied to all of the class was the systemic negligence claim
    which she had struck. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to what she described as this “fatal flaw”, she noted that various
    unclear words and phrases were used in defining the subclasses, which in her
    view would impair the ability to identify persons with a potential claim,
    define who would be bound by the result, and describe who was entitled to
    notice of the proceeding. She identified the phrase “in the vicinity of Queen’s
    Park”, the definition of the residual subclass, and the phrase “mass detention”
    in the various subclass definitions as unclear.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, she concluded that the class and subclass definitions
    were overly broad. While the proposed class definition and most of the
    subclasses excluded persons who were charged during the G20 summit, not all
    persons who engaged in unlawful conduct were necessarily charged. The
    definitions could include individuals who engaged in unlawful conduct and were
    lawfully detained and arrested.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that because the plaintiff failed to satisfy s. 5(1)(b),
    the certification motion failed. However, she went on to consider the
    requirements of s. 5(1)(c), (d) and (e).</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>3.4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>Section 5(1)(c): Common
    issues</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    5(1)(c) requires that “the claims or defences of the class members raise common
    issues”. By the end of the certification hearing, there were 22 proposed common
    issues before the motion judge. They are set out in Schedule “B”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge addressed the common issues only as they related to TPS, since she
    had found that the pleadings did not disclose a cause of action against
    Ontario, Canada or Peel. She also restricted her analysis to the common issues
    arising from the surviving claims against TPS. The common issues were further
    narrowed before the Divisional Court and, in turn, I will only highlight her
    conclusions on these latter common issues. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first of those issues was whether “each mass detention and/or arrest (or the
    prolonged duration thereof)” constituted false imprisonment and/or arbitrary
    detention or imprisonment contrary to s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that this was not a common issue.  At para. 205, she found
    that individual officers were responsible for deciding whether detention,
    arrest and a charge were appropriate.  At para. 206, she rejected the
    plaintiff’s argument that because a command was made to arrest a group, the
    lawfulness of that arrest could be decided in common.  She focused on what she
    found was evidence that individual conduct among protesters at the G20 Summit
    varied. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second set of remaining common issues related to the conditions or treatment of
    the class members imprisoned at the Detention Centre. At para. 245, the motion
    judge concluded that these proposed common issues were indeed common issues and
    noted that TPS did not dispute this. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third set of common issues related to remedies:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the Defendants breached the class members’ common law or <em>Charter</em> rights, can the Court make an aggregate assessment of damages as part of the
    common issues trial?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Were the Defendants guilty of conduct that justifies an award
    of punitive damages?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Are declarations regarding the lawfulness of certain police
    actions and/or tactics during the G20 Summit warranted? </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Are orders requiring the Defendants to expunge certain records
    warranted?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge wrote, at para. 247, that, “rather than proposing an issue to be
    determined at trial, [the first of these issues] asks whether the proposed
    common issue can be determined at the common issues trial.” She concluded that
    aggregate damages were inappropriate in this case. She wrote, at para. 250:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is clear from the evidence and even from the pleading that
    the experience of the proposed class members varied. This is not a case where
    monetary liability could be ascertained on a global basis. One obvious example
    is the contrast between those detained in the detention center and those who
    were not. Another example is the experience of Jessica Cole at Queen’s Park.
    Her arm was broken. This is obviously not an experience shared by all in this

    She concluded, at para. 255:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is clear given the lack of commonality that a class action
    would not be a fair, efficient and manageable method of advancing the claim.
    The impermissible use of eight subclasses creates an unwieldy group of claims.
    There is no single class that shares “substantial common issues” (<em>Caputo</em><i>,</i> at para. 45.) The common issues are subsumed by a plethora of individual
    issues. The result would be unmanageable litigation punctuated by numerous
    individual inquiries, and full trials for each class member. Instead of furthering
    the goal of judicial economy, a class proceeding would impede this important
    goal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    also noted that in this case behaviour modification did not depend on a class
    action. The conduct of police officers during the G20 summit had been and was
    continuing to be reviewed by various bodies and committees. Moreover,
    individual actions were being pursued in respect of events arising out of the
    G20 summit.</p>

    number of the claims asserted before the motion judge. <span style='line-height:

  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>4.2.<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span

    Divisional Court noted that it was not disputed that the s. 5(1)(a) cause of

    the motion judge had found were not made out.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>4.3.<span

    class</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the Divisional Court, the plaintiff eliminated two of the subclasses. 
    Significantly, one of these subclasses was the “residual” subclass, consisting
    of persons arrested at locations other than those where mass detentions were
    alleged to have occurred and eventually released without charge. The motion
    judge had found the definitions of both of the eliminated subclasses to be
    unclear. The revised proposed class definitions are set out in Schedule C. The
    Divisional Court was satisfied that the identifiable class criterion was met by
    these definitions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court disagreed with the motion judge that the phrase “mass
    detention” in the class definitions was confusing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It also disagreed that the class definitions were overly broad
    because they might include individuals whose conduct warranted arrest. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    it concluded that the motion judge erred in concluding that it was
    impermissible to certify a proceeding with multiple location-based subclasses.
    Section 5(2) of the Act, referred to by the motion judge, did not prohibit
    multiple subclasses within a class. This case, it held, was different from <em>Caputo</em><i>, </i>which the motion judge had relied on in her analysis. In <em>Caputo</em>,
    the proposed classes lacked “the essential element of commonality”. Moreover, <em>Caputo</em> did not suggest that a representative plaintiff cannot combine classes in a
    single proceeding.  The Divisional Court wrote, at paras. 35, 36 and 38:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, there is a single defendant and a single course
    of conduct alleged. Each of the proposed subclasses (save for the Detention
    Centre subclass) have the commonality of an alleged command order being made
    ordering the detention of the class members without regard for the individual
    characteristics or conduct of each class member. Indeed, it is alleged that one
    command officer, Superintendent Fenton, issued the command order in at least
    three of the five location based subclasses.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Further, allowing multiple subclasses to be joined in the same class
    proceeding, where they share a central common issue, facilitates two of the
    recognized goals of class proceedings: judicial economy and improving access to
    justice. As McLachlin C.J.C. said in <em>Hollick</em>,<b> </b>at para. 15:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>In my view, it is essential therefore that courts not take
    an overly restrictive approach to the legislation, but rather interpret the Act
    in a way that gives full effect to the benefits foreseen by the drafters. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[E]ven if the respondent was correct in its interpretation of
    the effect of <em>Caputo</em>, all that would result would be the creation of
    five separate class actions – one for each subclass – each with the same single
    defendant. If that were to be the result, there would be strong reasons for
    those five separate class actions to be tried together including for reasons of
    judicial economy, similarity of issues, common evidence and others. The end
    result, in practical terms, would be the same.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>4.4.<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eleven
    common issues were proposed at the Divisional Court. These are set out in
    Schedule “D”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    the motion judge, the Divisional Court concluded that the first of these – whether
    there was false imprisonment or a breach of s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em> – was a
    common issue. It explained, at paras. 46-7 and 49, that <em>R. v. Mann</em>, 2004
    SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, requires that the officer who gives the order to
    detain a person have reasonable cause to suspect that such person is criminally
    implicated in a recent or ongoing criminal offence. The test is even higher for
    an arrest. Both tests share a subjective and an objective element. The
    Divisional Court observed that, in this case, it is alleged that the command
    order was given without regard to whether any particular individual swept up in
    the mass detention was or was not implicated in the criminal activity with
    which the police were concerned, i.e. that the requirements for a lawful
    detention were unmet: paras. 47-48. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Divisional Court’s view, the motion judge impermissibly assessed the merits
    of the claims rather than considering whether there was some basis in fact for
    the proposition that the members of the class were arbitrarily detained and/or
    arrested in violation of their rights at common law or under s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em><i>.</i> It concluded that there was some basis in fact for this proposition and amended
    the issue to include the question – proposed as common issue 7 – of whether s.
    1 of the <em>Charter</em> could have application. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court found that there was no basis in fact to find that proposed
    common issue 2 was a proper common issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court concluded that proposed common issues 3 to 6, which arise out
    of the treatment of class members at and conditions in the Detention Centre,
    were proper common issues.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court came to a different conclusion from the motion judge on the
    suitability of aggregate damages as a common issue. While it agreed with the
    motion judge that “some limited individual examination” might be necessary
    before a final award of damages could be made, this would not preclude an
    aggregate assessment of some level of damages for the class members. Relying on
    para. 134 of <em>Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>2013 SCC 57, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 477</span></em><i>,</i> it
    concluded that it should be open to a common issues trial judge to consider
    whether aggregate damages would be an appropriate remedy. It therefore found
    that proposed common issue 8 was a proper common issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court rejected TPS’s argument that <em>Robinson v. Medtronic</em><i>,
    Inc.</i> (2009), <span class=ssl2>80 C.P.C. (6th) 87 (Ont. S.C.J.), affirmed </span>2010
    ONSC 3777 (Div. Ct.), stands for the proposition that punitive damages cannot
    be included as a common issue unless it will be known at the conclusion of the
    common issues trial what level of compensatory damages will be awarded. It
    stated, at para. 79, that if <em>Robinson</em> stood for that proposition, it
    disagreed with it. It concluded, at paras. 82-83, that the common issues trial
    judge would be in a position to make an informed decision on the
    appropriateness of an award of punitive damages and, accordingly, that whether
    TPS was guilty of conduct that justifies an award of punitive damages – proposed
    common issue 9 – was a proper common issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court was also satisfied that proposed common issues 10 (whether
    declaratory relief is warranted) and 11 (whether orders requiring TPS to
    expunge certain records are warranted) were proper common issues.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><b>4.5.<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court concluded that a class proceeding was the preferable procedure
    for the location-based subclasses. It described common issue 1 (false
    arrest/breach of s. 9) as the “core allegation” of these subclasses. It noted
    that the plaintiff alleged that a single command was made with respect to the
    mass arrest and/or detention at each of the locations. There was obvious
    judicial economy in determining once, for all members of the subclasses, on
    what basis the order to detain and/or arrest was made and how that order was
    communicated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    also concluded that the case raised a very serious access to justice issue.
    Most of the affected individuals would be unwilling to devote the time and
    expense necessary to seek individual relief. The fact that only a small number
    of individual cases had been commenced supported this conclusion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its view, the various investigations undertaken of the policing at the G20 summit
    did not achieve the goal of behaviour modification. It concluded, at para. 95,
    that an award of damages could “be the most telling and lasting expression that
    [the police conduct alleged] should never be tolerated.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Divisional Court concluded that a class action was also the preferable way
    of determining the issues raised by the Detention Centre, it noted, at para. 99:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The issues raised by the Detention Centre subclass are not
    similar to the issues raised by the location based subclasses nor do they
    involve similar evidence nor do they apparently involve even the same decision
    makers. Indeed, the only common theme between the two is the fact that the
    claims emanate out the G20 summit and the conduct of the police for whom [TPS]
    is responsible. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    it concluded that there should be a separate class action to determine the

    while the litigation plan might have to be reworked given its conclusion that
    two separate class actions should be certified, it was otherwise adequate. TPS’s
    criticisms of the litigation plan mirrored its criticisms of the common issues

    detentions and arrests did so without regard to whether all of the individuals
    detained, or detained and then arrested, were implicated in the criminal
    activity with which the police were concerned. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court correctly found “the commonality of an alleged command order
    being made ordering the detention of the class members without regard for the
    individual characteristics or conduct of each class member” (at para. 35). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of this central commonality linking the subclasses distinguishes this
    case from <em>Merck</em> and <em>Caputo</em>, which the motion judge relied on. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Divisional Court that the combination of classes in a single
    proceeding is not prohibited. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    s. 5.1(b) of the Act requires that “there is an identifiable class of two or
    more persons”, it does not prohibit the certification of an action as a class
    proceeding where there is more than one class. In my view, it would be overly
    restrictive to interpret the Act as containing such a prohibition. I agree with
    the Divisional Court that where, as here, the proposed classes share a central commonality,
    joining multiple classes in the same class proceeding would facilitate
    recognized goals of class proceedings, and the other requirements of s. 5.1
    would be satisfied, a motion judge, in her discretion, may do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, it was open to the Divisional Court to determine that it
    was appropriate to join the location-based subclasses in the same class
    proceeding. It might be argued that what the Divisional Court characterizes as
    location-based subclasses are properly described as distinct classes within a
    single class proceeding, and not subclasses. However, in the circumstances,
    this distinction is without substance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> I note that TPS does not argue that the plaintiff would not
    fairly and adequately represent the interests of all of the location-based subclasses
    or that the protection of the interests of the members of such subclasses
    requires that they be separately represented. The record includes an affidavit
    from a member of each of the location-based classes: it appears it would not be
    difficult to create separate representation. Should the circumstances change,
    such that separate representation is required, the court may amend the
    certification order pursuant to s. 10(1) of the Act on the motion of a party or
    class member.</p>

    reject TPS’ argument that the motion judge correctly concluded that the
    location-based subclass definitions should exclude individuals who engaged in
    unlawful conduct during the protests.  Her conclusion was made in the context
    of a proposed class that included more than location-based subclasses.  In the
    context of a class restricted to location-based subclasses, and some basis in
    fact that there was a single command order for group detentions and arrests at
    each location, focusing on evidence of varying individual conduct among the
    protesters unrelated to the single command order becomes an error in principle.
    I agree with the Divisional Court which wrote, at para. 29, that “it is of no
    consequence whether any member of the class did, in fact, commit a criminal
    offence or a breach of the peace. The police cannot justify the detention of a
    person based on information that they either did not have, or which they did
    not rely upon, in ordering a person to be detained.”</p>

    finding that there was a “fatal flaw” in the proposed class definition, the
    motion judge carefully catalogued what she considered to be other deficiencies
    in the proposed class definition, including that some words and phrases in the
    class definition were unclear. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her
    concern was largely with respect to the definition of the subclass of
    individuals detained or arrested in the vicinity of Queen’s Park and the
    “residual” subclass. The plaintiff addressed this concern by eliminating the
    Queen’s Park and residual subclasses before appealing to the Divisional Court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    all that remained on appeal was the motion judge’s concern with respect to the
    meaning of “mass detention”, as used in the definitions of the other
    location-based subclasses.  In each of the remaining subclass definitions,
    “mass detention” is qualified by “in a police cordon”. I agree with the
    Divisional Court that “mass detention” as used in these remaining definitions
    is not unclear. I have no doubt that if the only deficiency that the motion
    judge had perceived were the use of the words “mass detention” in these
    remaining definitions, she, like the Divisional Court, would have concluded
    that the s. 5(1)(b) criterion had been satisfied.</p>

    analysis. The motion judge’s conclusion that this issue was not a common issue was
    rooted in her focus on the possibility of varying individual conduct by the
    individuals who were arrested or detained which is an error in principle in the

  <p class=MsoListBullet2><i>6.3.2.<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    24(1) of the Act sets out when the court may award aggregate damages:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>24(1) The court may determine the aggregate or a
    part of a defendant’s liability to class members and give judgment accordingly
    where,</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(a) monetary relief is claimed on behalf of
    some or all class members;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(b) no questions of fact or law other than

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>(c) the aggregate or a part of the defendant’s
    liability to some or all class members can reasonably be determined without
    proof by individual class members.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, the motion judge concluded that monetary liability could not be
    determined at trial on a global basis. The Divisional Court concluded that this
    determination should be left to the common issues judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Divisional Court that it should be open to the common issues
    judge to consider whether aggregate damages would be an appropriate remedy, in
    whole or in part. The motion judge’s decision pre-dated the Supreme Court’s
    decision in <em>Pro-Sys</em>. At para. 134, Rothstein J. wrote this for the
    court, in relation to legislation in British Columbia that parallels the Act:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The question of whether damages assessed in the aggregate are
    an appropriate remedy can be certified as a common issue. However, this common
    issue is only determined at the common issues trial after a finding of
    liability has been made. <em>The ultimate decision as to whether the aggregate
    damages provisions of the CPA should be available is one that should be left to
    the common issues trial judge</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, this appears to be a case where the common issues judge
    may well determine that at least part of TPS’ liability can reasonably be
    determined without proof by individual class members. As the Divisional Court
    highlighted, s. 24(1) asks whether the aggregate <span class=Underline>or a
    part</span> of the defendant’s liability can reasonably be determined without
    proof by class members. And, as the Divisional Court observed, it would be open
    to a common issues judge to determine that there was a base amount of damages that
    any member of the class (or subclass) was entitled to as compensation for
    breach of his or her rights. It wrote, at para. 73, that “[i]t does not require
    an individual assessment of each person’s situation to determine that, if
    anyone is unlawfully detained in breach of their rights at common law or under
    s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>, a minimum award of damages in a certain amount is
    justified.”</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did not consider whether the proposed punitive damages issue was a
    proper common issue. It is undisputed that whether a defendant’s conduct merits
    an award of punitive damages can be certified as a common issue. Thus, the
    question is whether the Divisional Court erred in its conclusion that, in this
    case, it is a proper common issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Robinson</em>, Perell J. considered the law of punitive damages, as set out
    in <em>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</em>, 2002 SCC 18, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595.
    From that analysis, he concluded as follows, at para. 171:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In order to rationally determine whether punitive damages
    should be awarded and to determine the quantum of them, the court needs to know
    the quantum of compensation that will be awarded.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Robinson</em>, the common issues trial would not determine
    the defendant’s ultimate liability. Causation and injury to the class members
    were individual issues. Perell J. concluded that entitlement to and quantum of
    punitive damages were not a proper common issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    unlike in <em>Robinson</em>, the common issues dealing with alleged breaches of
    the class members’ rights contemplate that liability will be determined at the
    common issues trial. And the common issue proposed, and certified, is only
    whether TPS’ conduct justifies an award of punitive damages. The plaintiff did
    not propose as a common issue whether an award of punitive damages should be
    made against TPS and, if so, in what amount. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Pro-Sys</em><i>, </i>at para. 134, Rothstein J. makes clear that the
    failure to certify aggregate damages as a common issue does not preclude the
    trial judge from invoking s. 24(1) of the Act if considered appropriate once
    liability is found. In my view, it would also be open to the trial judge to
    consider whether, having regard to <em>Whiten</em>, an award of punitive
    damages should be made against TPS and, if so, in what amount, even though this
    issue has not been certified. The aggregate assessment of damages common issue
    contemplates that the common issues trial judge could determine at least part
    of the monetary relief owed to class members on an aggregate basis. While the Divisional
    Court conceded, at para. 72, that “some limited individual examination may be
    necessary before a final award of damages could be made”, it concluded, at
    para. 82:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, the common issues trial judge will be armed with
    all of the necessary information, including a general understanding of the
    likely level of compensatory damages, to make an informed decision on the
    appropriateness of an award of punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, if liability were found, and at least part of the compensatory damages
    were assessed on an aggregate basis, it would be open to the trial judge to
    consider whether she had a sufficient measure of the compensatory damages to
    determine entitlement to and the quantum of punitive damages, consistent with
    the principles in <em>Whiten</em>, or whether this could be determined only
    after any individual assessment phase.</p>

    requirement in s. 5(1)(d) <em>de novo</em> and not affording deference to the
    motion judge’s determination that a class proceeding was not the preferable
    procedure. It says that the Divisional Court did not explain how the fact that
    the plaintiff narrowed her action justified it in doing so or what errors the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span

    reject this argument. In the circumstances, the Divisional Court was entitled
    to consider the requirement in s. 5(1)(d) <em>de novo</em><i>.</i> “Lack of
    commonality” was fundamental to the motion judge’s determination that a class
    proceeding would not be the preferable procedure for the resolution of the
    common issues (at para. 255).  The Divisional Court correctly concluded both
    that the plaintiff had satisfied the identifiable class criterion in s. 5(1)(b)
    and that the core allegation in the action was indeed a common issue. These
    conclusions radically altered the landscape in which the preferability analysis
    was conducted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span

    argues that the Divisional Court’s certification of the plaintiff’s claim as
    two separate proceedings in the absence of discrete statements of claim was procedurally
    unfair because it deprived TPS of the ability to make submissions on the
    certification test with reference to a pleading. It submits that the Divisional
    Court’s approach was contrary to both <em>Brown v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>,
    2013 ONCA 18, 114 O.R. (3d) 355 and <em>Turner v. York University</em>, <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this argument. In another class action matter, this court  recently
    affirmed that “there must be some latitude on appeal for consideration of
    issues not raised at first instance provided that the other party is afforded procedural
    fairness”:  <em>Keatley Surveying Ltd. v. Teranet Inc.</em>, 2015 ONCA 248, 125
    O.R. (3d) 447, at para. 24.  I am not persuaded that there was any procedural

    possibility of converting the single proposed class action into more than one
    class action was suggested as an alternative in the plaintiff’s factum before
    the Divisional Court. TPS was not taken by surprise; it had the ability to
    respond to this suggested alternative. In these circumstances, TPS’ ability to
    make submissions on the certification test was unaffected by the absence of
    separate pleadings. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Brown</em>, in contrast, the motion judge conditionally certified the class
    proceeding in the absence of a statement of claim disclosing a cause of action.
    As Rosenberg J.A. wrote, at para. 44:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]dentification of a cause of action is fundamental. It is

    in <em>Turner</em>, the plaintiff sought to appeal the certification decision
    of the motion judge on the basis of a new, proposed Amended Statement of Claim
    that “significantly change[d] the underpinning of the class action”. The
    Divisional Court held that it was not the proper forum for a decision of first
    instance on certification and a fresh motion for certification in the court

    of the Divisional Court denied a plaintiff who was successful on appeal of
    costs of the certification motion. It reasoned that, unlike in <em>Keatley</em>,
    the plaintiff in this case did not completely re-formulate her case on the
    appeal. Here, the central claims against TPS remained. And unlike <em>Keatley</em>,
    this class action raised matters of public interest. </p>

    Divisional Court acknowledged that the issues raised were complex. However, it
    reduced the amount of costs claimed by the plaintiff “to reflect the time that
    was spent on the unsuccessful aspects of the claim as originally advanced” (at para.
    10).  At paras. 4 and 5, it wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The issue of plaintiffs amending their claims as the
    certification process unfolds is a problematic one, as we commented on in our
    reasons on the appeal. We do not accept the appellant’s position that such
    changes are of no real consequence in the assessment of a proper award of
    costs. The fact is that, had the claim been put forward originally in the form
    that it was put forward on the appeal, the decision of the motion judge might
    have been different. It follows that some amount of time that was spent on the
    certification motion was wasted because the plaintiff had cast her claim too
    broadly. There must be costs consequences associated with plaintiffs who
    overreach in that fashion…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>What is fair, in our view, is to recognize that the claim as
    presented before us was materially different than the claim presented before
    the certification judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court also noted that while TPS submitted a bill of costs on the certification
    motion in the amount of $637,835.29, it only sought the amount of $393,233.37,
    and was awarded only $223,233.37 in costs. </p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> Analysis</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the
    Divisional Court that a reduction in the costs sought by the plaintiff is
    warranted to reflect the change in the scope of the plaintiff’s claim on
    appeal. Indeed, the plaintiff acknowledges that some discount is appropriate.
    However, in my view, the Divisional Court erred in principle in two respects in
    arriving at its costs disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in determining
    the quantum of the award, the Divisional Court relied on inapplicable
    benchmarks. Second, it failed to consider the impact of its costs award on
    access to justice, a fundamental object of the Act and one of the principles
    and factors that a court must keep in mind in arriving at its costs
    disposition: <em>Ruffolo v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada</em>, 2009 ONCA
    274, <span class=nowrap>95 O.R. (3d) 709</span> at para. 37; <em>Brown</em>, at
    para. 58. Either of these errors in principle warrants the intervention of this
    court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I address these
    two points in turn.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have noted,
    in fixing the amount of costs it awarded, the Divisional Court focused on the
    fact that TPS only sought costs on the certification motion in the amount of
    $393,233.37, and the fact that it was only awarded $223,233.37 in costs. It was
    an error in principle to use these amounts as benchmarks.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 31(1) of
    the Act specifically mentions the public interest as a factor to be considered
    in fixing costs in class proceedings. This court has held that where a factor mentioned
    in s. 31(1) applies, failure to consider and accord significance to such a
    factor is an error in law: <em>Pearson v. Inco Ltd.</em> (2006), 79 O.R. (3d)
    427, at para. 11; <em>Brown</em>, at para. 39. TPS in seeking costs, and the
    motion judge in awarding them, accorded significance to the public interest
    factor: the costs sought by and awarded to TPS had built-in reductions for the
    public interest factor in this action. However, in costs awards to
    representative plaintiffs, the public interest factor operates in the opposite
    fashion, <i>increasing</i> the award to the plaintiff: <em>Pearson</em>, at
    para. 8. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the
    motion judge tempered the costs she awarded to TPS to reflect access to justice
    concerns. Such a reduction is similarly not appropriate when awarding costs of
    a certification motion to a successful plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TPS’ actual
    partial indemnity costs of $637,835.29 for the certification motion – and not
    the amount it actually sought or the amount awarded to it – is a measure of the
    costs that TPS could reasonably expect to pay and the reasonableness of the
    costs sought by the plaintiff in this undisputedly complex action. That amount
    is an appropriate benchmark.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn to the
    second point.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Pearson</em>,
    at para. 13, and <em>Brown</em>, at para. 58, this court provided a list of
    nine principles and factors to guide the award of costs on a certification
    motion. One of those is whether the appellant’s claim substantially evolved
    from the claim brought before the motion judge. Another is that a fundamental
    objective of the Act is to provide enhanced access to justice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, in
    my view the Divisional Court erred by reducing the costs it awarded to the
    plaintiff to reflect the evolution of her claim without considering the effect
    on the legislative goal to access to justice of doing so. <em>Ruffolo</em>, at
    para. 37, makes clear that in arriving at its costs dispositions, the court
    must <i>always </i>keep in mind the legislative goals of access to justice,
    behaviour modification and judicial economy. I accept the plaintiff’s
    submission that, left untouched, the Divisional Court’s costs award would have
    a chilling effect on public interest class actions and would substantially
    hinder access to justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bearing the
    principles and factors outlined in <em>Pearson</em>, <em>Brown</em> and <em>Ruffolo</em> in mind, in my view a fair and reasonable award in favour of the plaintiff is
    the all-inclusive amount of $315,000. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have
    discounted the costs that she seeks to reflect that her claim substantially
    evolved from the claim before the motion judge. The class proceeding as framed
    before the motion judge was quite different from that before the Divisional
    Court. This is apparent from the descriptions, at sections 3.1 and 4.1 of these
    reasons, of the class proceeding as framed before the motion judge and the
    Divisional Court and from a comparison of Schedules A and B to Schedules C and
    D of these reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as the
    plaintiff submits, and as the Divisional Court observed, the central claims
    against TPS remained intact. Also, I have taken into account the plaintiff’s
    submission that two of the three defendants she released on appeal had only
    been added to the claim because the motion judge held, at an earlier carriage
    motion, that it would be in the best interests of the class to do so.<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> 
     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the discount is less than would otherwise be the case because the action raises
    a very important issue of public interest, it is nonetheless meaningful.  If it
    were not, it would be unfair to TPS, which was faced with a significantly
    different claim on appeal. However, I am satisfied that the discount is not
    such that it will adversely affect the object of the Act of providing enhanced
    access to justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plaintiff also argued that the Divisional Court erred by
    failing to consider that the proceeding raised novel points of law. For
    example, she says, never before had it been alleged that a police organization
    had a duty of care for its overall planning of large-scale police operations.
    Moreover, she submits, this is the first group arrest action in common law
    Canada. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the proceeding raised novel points of
    law and that accordingly no costs should be awarded against her. The motion
    judge characterized the proceeding as entailing the application of settled
    negligence law. Further, she noted that the plaintiff had relied on mass
    detention/arrest class actions certified in Quebec and Ontario as justification
    for certification. She wrote, at para. 16, “If this argument is accepted then
    every class action with a subject matter that has never been ‘certified’ before
    would be ‘novel’”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the plaintiff submits, whether a proceeding raises a novel
    point of law is one of the three factors mentioned in s. 31(1) of the Act and a
    court must consider and accord significance to it in determining costs. <span
style='line-height:200%'>In my view, whether a proceeding is a novel point of
    law is an important determination when a plaintiff is unsuccessful in a
    certification motion. It may insulate her from a costs award. However, where,
    as in this case, the plaintiff is ultimately successful on the certification
    motion in an undisputedly complex proceeding, the “novel point of law” factor
    is subsumed in the assessment of the complexity of the issues. In arriving at
    my costs disposition, I have accepted that this is a complex proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>8. DISPOSITION AND COSTS OF THE APPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss the appeal, grant leave to the plaintiff to
    cross-appeal the costs awarded by the Divisional Court, allow the cross-appeal
    and award all-inclusive costs on the certification motion in the amount of $315,000
    to the plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the plaintiff
    was successful on the appeal and cross-appeal, I would award her costs of both,
    on a partial indemnity scale. Accordingly, the Law Foundation of Ontario is not
    entitled to notice or to make submissions in respect of costs. Bearing the
    principles and factors outlined in <em>Pearson</em>, <em>Brown</em> and <em>Ruffolo</em> in mind, $65,000 inclusive of disbursements and HST is in my view a fair and
    reasonable award. It is the amount of TPS’ all-inclusive partial indemnity
    costs on the appeal and cross-appeal. While less than the $116,789.16 the
    plaintiff sought, it is a significant award. </p>
