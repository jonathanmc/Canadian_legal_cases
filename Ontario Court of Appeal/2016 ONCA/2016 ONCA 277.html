  <p class=Heard>Heard: April 12, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal against the disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board dated August 14, 2015.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=Heading>Overview </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals the disposition of the Ontario Review Board
    (the “Board”) dated August 14, 2015, with reasons issued September 1, 2015. The
    Board ordered the appellant detained at a secure forensic unit of St. Joseph’s
    Healthcare, Hamilton, with escorted hospital, grounds, and community
    privileges. <span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant seeks an absolute discharge
    or, in the alternative, a conditional discharge, and in the further
    alternative, an order transferring him to the secure forensic unit at the
    Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”) in Toronto.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In October 2014, the appellant jumped over
    a school fence and carried away a four year old child who had been playing in
    the school yard. The child was terrified. He carried the child down the street
    and threatened him with a metal pole from an election sign, before the child
    was able to escape and run free. The appellant was apprehended and detained at
    St Joseph’s Healthcare. After the appellant had been detained, a nine year old
    child reported to police that in the previous month he had encountered the
    appellant on the street, and the appellant had demanded the child’s scooter and
    iPad, and had lifted the child’s shirt and touched his navel. The child ran
    away.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>On March 11, 2015, the appellant was
    found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder on charges of
    forcible seizure of a child, assault, assault with a weapon, and breaches of
    probation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Board’s initial disposition on
    August 14, 2015 unanimously found that the appellant poses a significant threat
    to the safety of the public. The appellant raises three issues on appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>1. the Board’s conclusion that the
    appellant poses a significant risk to the public is unreasonable and not
    supported by the evidence;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>2. the Board failed to give adequate
    consideration to the appellant’s reintegration needs when it declined to
    transfer him to CAMH; and </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>3. the Board erred in law by failing
    to consider a conditional discharge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>For the reasons that follow, the appeal
    is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber>Standard of Review</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The standard of review of a disposition
    or placement decision of the Board is set out in s. 672.78(1) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, and its application was explained in </span><em>R.
    v Owen</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, 2003 SCC 33, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at paras.
    31-37. This court can only set aside an order of the Board where it is of the
    opinion that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>1. the decision is unreasonable or
    cannot be supported by the evidence; or</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>2. the decision is based on a wrong
    decision on a question of law; or </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>3. there was a miscarriage of
    justice.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span class=MsoPageNumber>Issue 1: Was
    the conclusion that the appellant poses a significant risk to the public unreasonable
    or unsupported by the evidence?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant advances three arguments
    to establish that the Board’s decision was unreasonable: (1) the evidence
    before the Board was incapable of meeting the significant risk threshold, (2)
    the Board erroneously relied on allegations that did not result in convictions,
    and (3) the Board’s finding that the risk posed by the appellant had not
    changed since the time of the index offences was unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>We cannot give effect to any of these
    submissions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Board is required to determine
    whether the appellant poses a significant risk of serious harm to the public. The
    Board concluded that he does. This decision was supported by the expert
    evidence of by Dr. J. Ferencz and Dr. M. Mamak. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Dr. Ferencz assessed the appellant’s
    fitness to stand trial while in detention, and has since seen the appellant in
    a variety of settings. He diagnosed the appellant with bipolar disorder, a
    diagnosis which was subsequently confirmed by two other psychiatrists. Dr.
    Mamak’s assessment was that the appellant continues to present a significant
    risk to act out violently.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Board found that the appellant
    lacks insight into his illness, an illness which remains untreated because the
    appellant had refused treatment and medication for his mental illness. The
    appellant has been assessed as incapable to consent to treatment by the Consent
    and Capacity Board and his appeal of that decision was dismissed by the
    Superior Court of Justice. He remains untreated pending an appeal of that decision
    to this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Board accepted Dr. Ferencz’s
    evidence that the appellant’s risk level has not changed, and that because the
    appellant remains untreated, the situation that gave rise to the child
    abduction could happen again if the appellant were released into the community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant argues that the Board’s
    decision was unreasonable in that it treated his refusal to accept medication
    as determinative of his risk to the community. He argues that just as his past
    psychotic episodes resolved without medication, so too has this episode. He
    maintains that the totality of the evidence before the Board indicated that he
    is stable and does not pose a threat to the community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant also objects to the
    Board’s reliance on a threat assessment report prepared by Calgary Police
    Services in assessing the appellant’s risk to the public. That report sets out
    the appellant’s history of violent threats, which predates the index offence. There
    was no objection to the admissibility of this report at the hearing, and it was
    properly admissible. This court has held that such information can be used to
    assess whether an accused poses a significant threat to the safety of the
    public and in determining the appropriate disposition: </span><em>Re Ranieri</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2015 ONCA 444, at para. 17. The Board was entitled to
    determine what weight to give to the report, and that determination is entitled
    to deference.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In our view, the Board’s finding that
    the appellant poses a significant risk of harm to the public is not
    unreasonable. It is supported by evidence, particularly the evidence of Dr.
    Ferencz that the appellant remains unstable and requires treatment with
    psychiatric medication in order to stabilize his mental state. There is no
    basis for this court to interfere with this finding.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span class=MsoPageNumber>Issue 2:
    Did the Board err by failing to give adequate consideration to the appellant’s
    reintegration needs in refusing to transfer him to CAMH?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant requested a transfer to
    CAMH in Toronto in order to facilitate his integration into the community. Although
    the appellant resides in Hamilton and the index offence occurred in Hamilton,
    the appellant desires to ultimately relocate to Toronto where he can draw on
    the support of a larger gay community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Board held that the appellant’s application
    was premature. There is a significant waiting list at CAMH, and a pending
    transfer would interfere with treatment planning for the appellant. Additionally,
    there are no therapeutic options available at CAMH that are not available at St
    Joseph’s in Hamilton. The Board rejected the appellant’s argument that a
    transfer to CAMH would benefit him by providing access to a larger gay
    community in Toronto, as he currently has no community access at all. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Board attended to the appellant’s submission
    and rejected it on therapeutic and other grounds. We see no error in the
    Board’s decision.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><span class=MsoPageNumber>Issue
    3: Did the Board err in refusing to consider a conditional discharge?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span class=MsoPageNumber>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Given the Board’s finding that the
    appellant poses a significant risk to the community, there was simply no basis
    for a conditional discharge. As such, the Board committed no error in not
    considering it.</span></p>
