  <p class=Heard>Heard: October 20, 2015</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on December 1, 2011
    by Justice Anne M. Molloy of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Watt J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu had
    a business. A recycling business. Tiga Metals. He recycled things made of
    metal. Used auto parts. Like catalytic converters.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>One cold winter morning a
    man drove up to the entrance of Tiga Metals in a white van. The man entered
    Tiga Metals. Five minutes later, he drove away.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>After the white van left, no
    one spoke to Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu again. Not by telephone. And not in
    person. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>About five hours later, two
    other men entered Tiga Metals. They found Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu lying dead
    on the floor. In a pool of blood. Stabbed. And bludgeoned. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>A jury concluded that Jawad
    Hassanzada killed Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu. The killing, the jury decided, was
    unlawful and amounted to second degree murder. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Jawad Hassanzada appeals.
    The judge, he says, made some mistakes. In the way she restricted the defence
    address but not the Crown address to the jury about the absence of forensic
    evidence linking him to the killing. And in instructing the jury about the significance
    of this absence of forensic link in deciding whether the Crown had proven his
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>As I will explain, I would
    reject the claims of error advanced on behalf of Hassanzada and dismiss his
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The evidence adduced at
    trial was entirely circumstantial. Jawad Hassanzada did not testify or call any
    witnesses. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The grounds of appeal
    advanced do not require an elaborate recitation of the evidence admitted at
    trial. A brief summary provides a sufficient setting within which to understand
    the grounds of appeal and permit their determination. </p>
  <h1>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Tiga
    Metals</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary business of Tiga Metals involved the purchase and sale of
    used car parts, mainly catalytic converters. The business had few employees. Rajeswaran
    Saravanamuthu worked there. And so did his brother-in-law. Others had worked
    there from time to time over the several months prior to Rajeswaran
    Saravanamuthus death. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu dealt in cash. He kept a large amount of cash
    on hand, often in a money pouch. He also carried a wallet but did not keep much
    cash in it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tiga Metals was a preferred buyer of used car parts because it paid
    sellers more than many of its competitors. Regular customers would make
    appointments by calling Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu on his cellphone or on the
    landline associated with the business. Some customers would bring used parts to
    Tiga Metals several times a day. </p>
  <h1>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The
    Business Premises</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The business premises of Tiga Metals were in a warehouse. There were
    four pedestrian entrances, one on each side of the building.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main entrance to Tiga Metals was on the south side of the building.
    On that side were two garage doors. One opened to a ramp leading to the south
    driveway. Customers often entered through that door, which was usually open
    during business hours. The other garage door opened to a loading dock occupied
    by a large dumpster. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The east and west doors were used infrequently. And the north door used
    only rarely. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tiga Metals had a sophisticated security system. An alarm system
    monitored the pedestrian entrances and garage doors. A CCTV camera system
    monitored all but the east entrance. The cameras were motion-activated. Inside
    the warehouse was a security camera, but it did not capture the entirety of the
    interior. No evidence described the specifications, range or sensitivity of the
    cameras. </p>
  <h1>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Relationship between Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu and Jawad Hassanzada</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jawad Hassanzada was a customer of Tiga Metals, as was his brother.
    Hassanzada was known as Jayy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For about six months prior to February 2009, Hassanzada attended
    university in Oshawa. He stopped frequenting Tiga Metals during this six month
    period, but resumed his attendance thereafter. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By all accounts, the relationship between Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu and
    Hassanzada was cordial. </p>
  <h1>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The
    Appointment</h1>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On March 12, 2009, Rajeswaran
    Saravanamuthu agreed to drive his sister-in-law, who was pregnant, to her
    medical appointment at a local hospital. Shortly before leaving for the
    hospital, Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu returned a telephone call to Hassanzada. He
    was overheard to say that he would be there in half an hour. He made this
    call around 9:45 a.m.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu dropped
    his sister-in-law and her friend off at the hospital shortly after 10:00 a.m.
    He explained to them that he was going to Tiga to take delivery of a catalytic
    converter and then to a garage to get the lock on his Jeep fixed. He told his
    passengers that he would be back to pick them up in half an hour, but asked
    them to call him if the medical appointment was delayed.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu called
    Hassanzadas cellphone at about 10:07 a.m. The call was transmitted by a tower
    near Tiga Metals business premises. </span></p>
  <h1>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The
    Warehouse and the White Van</h1>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu returned
    to Tiga Metals at 10:09 a.m. He entered through the south door, disarmed the
    alarm system, and began removing items from in front of the garage door leading
    to the loading ramp inside the warehouse. He unlocked and opened the garage
    door then headed east inside the warehouse. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu never
    appeared on any surveillance video after he entered the warehouse.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At about 10:14 a.m., a white van
    backed up the loading ramp to the open garage door. The back doors of the van
    remained closed. The driver of the van got out of the vehicle, closed the door
    behind him, walked up the ramp and entered the warehouse. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>No one identified the driver of
    the van. There was evidence, however, on which the jury could find on the basis
    of the colour, model, external features and incidental markings, including a
    damaged right headlight, a rust pattern on the body, the absence of a window in
    the rear doors, bug deflectors on the grille, and bird droppings on the roof
    that the white van belonged to Jawad Hassanzada. Police surveillance over a
    period of days following the killing revealed that no one other than Hassanzada
    drove the van. </span></p>
  <h1>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The
    Departure of the White Van</h1>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Around 10:19 a.m., the driver of
    the white van walked out of the warehouse and down the ramp. He got into the
    van and drove away. The large garage door at the top of the ramp remained open.
    The air temperature, including wind chill, was minus 15 degrees Celsius.</span></p>
  <h1>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Efforts
    to Contact Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu</h1>

    extensive use of his cellphone to conduct his business. However, over the
    several hours that followed the white vans departure from Tiga Metals, no one
    spoke to or was called by Rajeswaran Saravanamuthu. All efforts to contact him
    on his cellphone failed. He did not call or pick up his sister-in-law at the
    hospital as he had agreed to do earlier. </span></p>
  <h1>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The

    about 3:00 p.m. on March 12, 2009, surveillance cameras showed five people
    arrive in different vehicles at Tiga Metals. All entered the business premises
    through the south door. Cameras inside the premises did not capture every move
    of these visitors but none remained for more than about ninety seconds. None of
    these men were identified. </span></p>
  <h1>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Discovery

    12, 2009, two men got out of a dark-coloured van by the ramp at the south
    entrance to Tiga Metals. They walked up the ramp. Both carried a catalytic
    converter. They entered the unit, found the deceaseds body, and called 911. </span></p>

    the 911 call. The only doors open on their arrival were the south pedestrian door
    and the garage door at the top of the ramp to the south entrance. The other
    doors were locked. The east door required a key to lock it from the outside. A
    shovel rested against the inside of that door. The area around this door was
    not covered by any surveillance camera. </span></p>

    indicated that the business was closed on March 12, 2009 and directed enquiries
    to the deceaseds cellphone. The door at the top of the landing ramp was
    usually closed in the winter, opened only when customers arrived. Despite the
    usual practice and a wind chill of minus 15 degrees Celsius, the door remained
    open after the deceased entered around 10:00 a.m. </span></p>

    deceased after the white van left Tiga Metals. The surveillance cameras did not
    show him inside the building. He did not go outside. He did not speak to or go
    to the hospital to pick up his sister-in-law as he had agreed to do. None of

    same exterior features including damage to its exterior and bird droppings on
    its roof. Hassanzada, according to police surveillance, was its only driver. The

    nature of the killing and the involvement of two or more weapons. Yet police
    never found the murder weapons, let alone any link between those weapons and
    the appellant. The deceaseds blood was not found on the appellants clothing
    or in his van despite protracted forensic examination of the interior of the
    vehicle. The van disclosed no evidence of wiping. This absence of evidence

    objected to the proposed CSI instruction because embedded in it was an
    assumption of which there was no evidence  that the absence of forensic
    evidence linking a person to a crime scene was common and did not mean that the
    person was not there. This took away from the absence of evidence component

    the importance of the absence of any forensic link between Hassanzada and the
    killing of the deceased. She pointed out that there was no evidence that blood
    gushed or sprayed all over the murder scene, only that it oozed out of the
    deceaseds body from severance of a vein. The blood at the scene was minimal.
    Thus, the likelihood of its presence on the killers weapons and clothing and,
    as a consequence, its transfer to the van was also minimal. The trial Crown
    acknowledged that the forensic identification officer found no evidence that
    the interior of the van had been wiped. She submitted, however, that it was

    Police found no weapons, let alone weapons in Hassanzadas possession. They
    found no blood in the van or on anything connected to Hassanzada. Admittedly,
    there was not a lot of blood at the scene, but blood was found a considerable
    distance away from the deceaseds body making it likely that the killer or the

    absence of forensic evidence created a significant conundrum for the Crown in a

    facts matters of which there was no evidence. Implicit in the Crowns
    submissions that there was no evidence of a large gushing or spraying of blood
    or a scene bathed in blood was the contention that a large volume of blood was
    required before transference could occur and provide a forensic link to the

    hyperbole about the scene being coated in blood. The defence position was not
    dependant on there being a high volume of blood at the scene. The defence
    position was that a miniscule amount of blood was all that was required for DNA

    actual evidence adduced during the Crowns case. She over-reached by saying
    that, despite the forensic evidence that there was no indication that the
    interior of the van had been wiped, common sense would suggest a clean-up. This

    open to the Crown at trial to argue that there was not so much blood at the
    scene that it would necessarily adhere to the weapons or project onto
    Hassanzadas clothing and thus have been transferred to the van. The
    pathologist made it clear that the outpouring of blood from the deceased was by
    oozing, not by arterial spray, thereby reducing the likelihood of its landing
    on the assailants clothing. The respondent adds that there was no evidence of
    the relative positions of the deceased and his assailant. Finally, the van was
    not searched until six days after the killing. There was sufficient time to
    remove and dispose of the clothing and weapons. </span></p>

    of the amount and distribution of the bloodstaining at the scene did not depart
    significantly from the evidence adduced. The largest pool of blood was under
    and around the deceaseds body. The pooling was caused by the oozing of blood,
    not by an arterial spray. There was no evidence about the relative positions of
    the assailant and the deceased. </span></p>

    photographs and a video of the murder scene. The Crown invited them to review
    this evidence in the jury room. And to draw their own conclusions from it. The
    trial judge did likewise. These fixed records go much of the way to minimize
    the effect of any misstatement or exaggeration by counsel in their closing
    addresses. Counsel and the trial judge also made it clear that jurors were not
    bound by any references to the evidence made by counsel or by the trial judge;
    rather jurors were obliged to rely on their own recollections and assessment of
    the evidence and what it established or failed to prove. </span></p>

    absence of forensic evidence in the appellants van, the trial Crown
    acknowledged that the forensic identification officer found no evidence that
    the interior had been wiped down. Her further suggestion inviting jurors to use
    their common sense that the killer would remove any forensic links from the van
    did not misstate evidence, invite impermissible speculation, or furnish
    information that was not before the jury. </span></p>

    counsel for the appellant offered no objection to the closing address of the
    Crown. It is a reasonable inference, in the circumstances of this case, that
    neither counsel who appeared for the appellant at trial, both experienced
    criminal lawyers, did not consider that the trial Crowns address exceeded

    inferences from the evidence but were not permitted to speculate. By
    commonplace example, she explained the inference-drawing process. In her
    instructions about the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial
    judge told the jury that a reasonable doubt could arise from the evidence or an
    absence of evidence. She explained that proof beyond a reasonable doubt fell
    much closer to absolute certainty than to probable or likely guilt. </span></p>

    to proof by circumstantial evidence. In her final reference to proof by
    circumstantial evidence, the trial judge said as follows: </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>You must consider the whole of the
    evidence in reaching your verdict. The burden is on the Crown to satisfy you
    beyond a reasonable doubt as to Mr. Hassanzadas guilt. I have instructed you
    on the particular application of that standard in a case based entirely on
    circumstantial evidence. You may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence,
    but you can only reach a verdict of guilty if you are satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that guilt is the only reasonable inference based on the whole
    of the evidence. That does not mean that you must be satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt with respect to each and every piece of individual evidence
    you consider or the inferences to be drawn from various pieces of evidence. It
    is the evidence as a whole to which the reasonable doubt standard applies. If
    you find, <em>based on the whole of the evidence or the absence of evidence,</em> that there is another possible reasonable inference as to who killed Mr.
    Saravanamuthu, apart from Mr. Hassanzada being the killer, then you must find
    Mr. Hassanzada not guilty. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    defence position repeating language of defence counsels choosing. In
    connection with the significance of the absence of forensic evidence linking
    the appellant to the killing, the trial judge said the following: </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Notwithstanding the brutality of
    the murder and the fact that at least two weapons were involved, no physical or
    forensic evidence was ever found at Mr. Hassanzadas residences or in his van
    linking him to the scene of the crime. The Crown has established nothing more
    than a business connection between Mr. Hassanzada and Mr. Saravanamuthu. Mr.
    Hassanzada is entitled to an acquittal. </p>

    instruction in a portion of her charge entitled Forensic Evidence. She said
    as follows: </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>I am sure you will have realized
    from your experience over the past few weeks that real-life trials are not what
    you have seen in dramatized television shows. The same is true of forensic
    evidence, which is not anything close to as definitive or exotic as what you
    often see on TV shows such as <em>CSI</em>. Often forensic examination of an
    item will not reveal anything of relevance. A classic example is that a handgun
    may have no usable fingerprints on it, even though it was handled by a person
    not wearing gloves. It is certainly not the case that every time somebody
    enters a room or touches an item, he or she will leave behind a fingerprint, or
    DNA, or some other kind of trace evidence. In such cases, the absence of
    evidence is not proof of the opposite proposition: <em>i.e.</em> it is not
    proof that the person did not enter the room or did not handle the gun; it is
    merely an absence of proof that he did. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As I have already instructed you, <em>a
    reasonable doubt may arise from the evidence,</em> or <em>the absence of
    evidence,</em> but must not be based on speculation or conjecture. The forensic
    examination of Mr. Hassanzadas van did not disclose any evidence of blood or
    other DNA from Mr. Saravanamuthu. There is therefore an absence of any forensic
    evidence connecting Mr. Saravanamuthu to the van. <em>You are entitled to take
    into account the absence of such evidence in deciding whether, on the whole of
    the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to Mr. Hassanzadas guilt.</em> The killer may or may not have entered the van or placed items in the van
    without leaving trace evidence behind. That is for you to determine. The
    absence of such forensic evidence is merely one factor to be taken into
    account, along with all of the other evidence, in determining your verdict. [Emphasis

    the jury that the absence of a forensic connection between the appellant and
    deceased is itself an item of circumstantial evidence, one that supported a
    reasonable doubt about the appellants guilt. It was a violent murder,
    involving more than one weapon. Yet nothing was recovered. No weapon. No blood

    assailant or to any vehicle used by the assailant to flee the scene. A forensic

    errors in giving the CSI instruction and in the substance of what was said
    were aggravated by the restrictions placed on defence counsel in her closing

    submissions with an acknowledgment that the absence of evidence, including the
    absence of evidence of a forensic connection between a crime and an accused,
    may raise a reasonable doubt about an accuseds guilt. In cases like this, in
    which jurors have heard no evidence as to the probative value of to be

    the trial judges concerns about the closing address of defence counsel and the
    need for a CSI instruction was justifiable disquiet about the absence of
    evidence being converted to positive evidence or proof of the contrary. This
    was a valid concern because past judicial experience indicates that the jury
    might expect forensic evidence to be left behind and, thus, could conclude that
    the absence of evidence here definitively ruled out the appellants guilt. The
    trial judges instruction successfully guarded against this flawed reasoning. </span></p>

    it in her charge to the jury. In her jury instructions, the trial judge
    repeatedly told the jury that the absence of evidence could raise a reasonable
    doubt about the adequacy of the Crowns proof. But it was equally important
    that the jurors understood the limits of the absence of evidence. The charge
    made it clear that the absence of evidence was a factor to consider but did not

  <p style='text-align:justify'>I am sure you will have realized
    from your experience over the past few weeks that real-life trials are not what
    you have seen in dramatized television shows. The same is true of forensic
    evidence, which is not anything close to as definitive or exotic as what you
    often see on TV shows such as <em>CSI</em>. Often forensic examination of an
    item will not reveal anything of relevance. A classic example is that a handgun
    may have no usable fingerprints on it, even though it was handled by a person
    not wearing gloves. It is certainly not the case that every time somebody
    enters a room or touches an item, he or she will leave behind a fingerprint, or
    DNA, or some other kind of trace evidence. In such cases, the absence of
    evidence is not proof of the opposite proposition: <em>i.e.</em> it is not
    proof that the person did not enter the room or did not handle the gun; it is
    merely an absence of proof that he did. </p>

    evidence adduced at trial or an absence of evidence. The trial judge also
    included an express instruction about the link between the absence of forensic
    evidence and reasonable doubt in the paragraph immediately following the
    impugned passage. She instructed the jury: </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As I have already instructed you, <em>a
    reasonable doubt may arise from the evidence, or the absence of evidence,</em> but must not be based on speculation or conjecture. The forensic examination of
    Mr. Hassanzadas van did not disclose any evidence of blood or other DNA from
    Mr. Saravanamuthu. There is therefore an absence of any forensic evidence
    connecting Mr. Saravanamuthu to the van. <em>You are entitled to take into
    account the absence of such evidence in deciding whether, on the whole of the
    evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to Mr. Hassanzadas guilt.</em> The
    killer may or may not have entered the van or placed items in the van without
    leaving trace evidence behind. That is for you to determine. The absence of
    such forensic evidence is merely one factor to be taken into account, along
    with all of the other evidence, in determining your verdict. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    judge repeatedly used </span><em>Hodges</em><span style='line-height:200%'>-equivalent
    language at various points in her charge. What follows is typical: </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>You must consider the whole of the
    evidence in reaching your verdict. The burden is on the Crown to satisfy you
    beyond a reasonable doubt as to Mr. Hassanzadas guilt. I have instructed you
    on the particular application of that standard in a case based entirely on
    circumstantial evidence. You may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence,
    but you can <em>only reach a verdict of guilty if you are satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that guilt is the only reasonable inference based on the whole
    of the evidence.</em> That does not mean that you must be satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt with respect to each and every piece of individual evidence
    you consider or the inferences to be drawn from various pieces of evidence. It
    is the evidence as a whole to which the reasonable doubt standard applies. <em>If
    you find, based on the whole of the evidence or the absence of evidence, that
    there is another possible reasonable inference</em> as to who killed Mr.
    Saravanamuthu, apart from Mr. Hassanzada being the killer, then you must find
    Mr. Hassanzada not guilty. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    variable in its significance to the burden of proof settled on the Crown and
    the satisfaction of that standard of proof. In this case, forensic examination
    of the van occurred six days after the deceased was killed. In these
    circumstances, the fact that the van did not furnish any evidence connecting
    the appellant to the killing or where it occurred is of reduced significance
    than would be the case where the search was more contemporaneous with the

    failed to expressly instruct the jury that an absence of evidence is itself an
    item of circumstantial evidence caused no prejudice. It may well be true, as a
    matter of logic, that one can characterize an absence of evidence as an item of
    circumstantial evidence. But it seems unlikely that such a characterization
    would improve a jurys understanding that an absence of evidence may raise a
    reasonable doubt about an accuseds guilt. Nothing said in </span><em>Lifchus</em><span

    after the van left. He never appeared on the surveillance video and failed to pick
