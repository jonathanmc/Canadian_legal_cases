    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated March 13, 2015, with reasons reported
    at 2015 ONSC 1671.</p>
  <p><strong>Hourigan J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal of the order of the motion judge
    dismissing an oppression remedy claim on a motion for summary judgment raises
    two issues. First, is summary judgment available in the context of an
    application as opposed to an action? Second, does the two-year limitation
    period in the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, apply to
    oppression remedy claims and, in particular, to claims of ongoing oppressive
    conduct?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I am of the view
    that a motion for summary judgment under Rule 20 is not available to adjudicate
    issues raised on an application under Rule 14 of the <em>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</em> unless the application is converted into an action. However, as
    I will go on to explain, the use of Rule 20 in the circumstances of this case
    was merely a procedural defect and thus I would not interfere with the motion
    judge’s decision on this basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An oppression remedy claim must be commenced
    within two years of the discovery of a potential claim. The alleged oppressive
    conduct in this case is not ongoing. However, where, as here, a party engages
    in conduct that is in furtherance of, or based upon, earlier oppressive
    conduct, this is a new cause of action because it is new oppressive conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For this reason, I conclude that the motion
    judge erred in dismissing the appellant’s oppression claim as statute barred. I
    would allow the appeal and order that the oppression remedy claim proceed as a trial. </span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background Facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and the individual respondents are
    siblings except for George Alles, who is the husband of Lorraine Alles.
    Starting in the 1950s, their late father, Mr. Maurice, owned an interest in
    Television Antenna &amp; Service Co. (“Tasco”) through his holding company
    Kirby-Maurice Company Limited (“Kirby-Maurice”). Marlba Investments Limited
    (“Marlba”) owned the land on which Tasco operated. Marlba, in turn, was owned
    equally by Kirby-Maurice and another holding company owned by their father’s
    business partner, Mike Sayer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Maurice restructured Tasco in the late
    1970s. He gave equal interests in Tasco to each of his six children and Mr.
    Sayer’s six children, preserving voting control for his family by causing the
    issuance of 54 percent of Tasco’s voting preferred shares to Kirby-Maurice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the early 1990s, litigation between the
    Maurice and Sayer families concerning Tasco and Marlba concluded with a
    settlement agreement that provided for the ownership structure of the two
    companies. It also specified that both families would enter into unanimous
    shareholder agreements (“USAs”) to govern the business and affairs of each
    company. The appellant and his siblings were parties to this settlement
    agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Those USAs were never executed. The parties,
    however, governed themselves according to provisions set out in the settlement
    agreement, which were to be contained in the USAs. Those provisions included a
    prohibition on the transfer of shares in either Tasco or Marlba except between
    members of the same family, a shareholder’s right to require the corporation to
    repurchase their common shares for cancellation at fair value, and a right of
    first refusal with respect to the shares sought to be repurchased by the
    corporation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Maurice siblings, who were each 20 percent
    owners of Kirby-Maurice, later entered into a USA concerning their interests in
    that company (the “Kirby-Maurice USA”). The Kirby-Maurice USA provided, among
    other things, for a share sale procedure. Critical to this appeal were
    provisions requiring a shareholder selling their shares in Tasco and Marlba to
    also sell, at a fair value to be determined by a valuator, his or her shares in
    Kirby-Maurice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 13, 1996, the appellant exercised his
    right to sell his shares in Tasco and Marlba. In accordance with the terms of
    the Kirby-Maurice USA, the appellant offered to sell his shares in
    Kirby-Maurice at the same time. The sale of the appellant’s shares in Tasco and
    Marlba did not close until March 23, 2007, almost 11 years after he first
    exercised his right under the settlement agreement. When it did, the appellant
    received a total of $2,275,000 for his shares; $1,966,700 for his shares in
    Tasco and $308,300 for his shares in Marlba, based on the July 31, 2005
    valuation completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Negotiations between the respondents and a prospective
    purchaser ultimately led to Tasco and Marlba shareholders’ (including the
    respondent siblings and Kirby-Maurice) receiving a letter of intent from a
    third party with an interest in acquiring their shares in June 2007. The
    appellant, who was no longer a shareholder of Tasco or Marlba, first learned of
    the potential purchase in October 2007. He expressed his view that
    Kirby-Maurice’s 54 percent of the voting preferred shares in Tasco should fetch
    a premium given that they represented control of the company.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the meantime, although he had offered his
    shares in Kirby-Maurice for sale, the appellant remained a shareholder and
    director of Kirby-Maurice. He received notice of a Kirby-Maurice shareholders’
    meeting scheduled for July 25, 2008 to discuss a proposed sale of
    Kirby-Maurice’s shares in Tasco and Marlba. At the meeting, the appellant was
    advised of the following: his siblings had sold their shares in Tasco and
    Marlba; the purchaser was a numbered company; the owner of that company was
    unknown; Kirby-Maurice’s preferred shares in Tasco were being sold for
    redemption at face value; and Kirby-Maurice’s nominees to Tasco and Marlba’s
    boards of directors were resigning. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant opposed the sale. He argued that
    proceeding without the unanimous consent of the shareholders would breach the
    Kirby-Maurice USA and that his siblings should obtain a valuation before
    selling their shares in Tasco and Marlba. After the appellant left the meeting,
    his siblings approved the sale of Kirby-Maurice’s shares in Tasco and Marlba.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since the meeting of July 25, 2008, the
    appellant has requested a valuation of his shares in Kirby-Maurice and, on
    numerous occasions, requested information relating to how Kirby-Maurice’s
    preferred shares in Tasco were valued for the purposes of their sale. These
    requests have been either ignored or refused by his siblings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2013, the appellant’s siblings brought an
    application for the appointment of a valuator to value the issued and
    outstanding shares of Kirby-Maurice. The appellant commenced a
    cross-application against his siblings, George Alles, and Kirby-Maurice,
    alleging breach of both the settlement agreement and the Kirby-Maurice USA, and
    seeking relief under the oppression remedy section of the <i>Business
    Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (“OBCA”) arising out of the sale of
    Kirby-Maurice’s shares in Tasco and Marlba. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2014, the appellant received a copy of the
    share purchase agreement for the sale of the respondents’ and Kirby-Maurice’s
    shares in Tasco and Marlba, dated August 1, 2008, as part of the respondents’
    disclosure. The appellant also learned the following:</span></p>

  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decision Below</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Pursuant to an order of Newbould J., dated
    October 1, 2013, the cross-application was to be determined as a mini-trial
    before the application to appoint a valuator. The respondents brought a motion
    for summary judgment to dismiss the claims in the cross-application as being
    statute barred and for the valuator’s appointment. The appellant brought a
    motion requiring the respondents to reimburse Kirby-Maurice for legal fees the
    corporation paid on the respondents’ behalf in connection with the ongoing
    disputes with the appellant from 2008 onward.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the motion and cross-motion, the respondents
    argued that the appellant’s claims all related to the sale by Kirby-Maurice of
    its shares in Tasco. The respondents argued that the appellant discovered the
    claims as of July 25, 2008, the date of the shareholder’s meeting when the
    appellant learned of the respondents’ sales of their own shares and the
    proposed sale of Kirby-Maurice’s shares in Tasco and Marlba. As the
    cross-application was commenced more than two years after the claims were
    discovered, the claims were out of time. The appellant argued that his claims
    were not barred since the oppressive conduct was ongoing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the appellant’s claims for
    breach of the settlement agreement and the Kirby-Maurice USA, the motion judge
    found that the appellant was aware of these breaches as of July 25, 2008.
    Accordingly, he held that the breach of contract claims were statute barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge found that the appellant was
    similarly aware of the facts giving rise to the oppression claims related to
    the Kirby-Maurice USA as of July 25, 2008. Consequently, those claims were also
    statute barred. At para. 54 of his reasons, the motion judge relied on <em>Fracassi
    v. Cascioli</em>, 2011 ONSC 178, for the proposition that “pursuant to the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>, the applicable limitation period for an oppression claim begins two
    years after the day on which the claim for oppression was discovered.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge held that even if the
    oppression is ongoing, “such continuation does not operate to extend the
    limitation period beyond the time of two years from discovery.” In this regard,
    the motion judge distinguished <em>Waxman v. Waxman</em> (2004), 186 O.A.C. 201
    (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 291 and <em>Metcalfe v. Anobile</em>,
    2010 ONSC 5087, 77 B.L.R. (4th) 293, on the basis that, while those cases
    referred to the ongoing nature of the conduct to defeat a limitation period,

    address the issue of the availability of a summary judgment motion on an

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The starting point in the analysis is the
    language of Rule 20.  It is clear that the rule contemplates that it will be
    used in the context of an action and not an application. The rule specifies
    that a motion for summary judgment is available to a “plaintiff” after the
    delivery of the “statement of defenc<i>e</i>” on all or part of the claim in
    the “statement of claim”. Similarly, a “defendant” may move for summary
    judgment to dismiss all or part of the claim in the “statement of claim”. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The emphasized terms are defined in r. 1.03 and
    it is plain that they apply in the context of an action and not an application.
    A plaintiff is defined as “a person who commences an action” and a defendant is
    “a person against whom an action is commenced”. An action is a proceeding that
    is not an application and includes a proceeding commenced by, among other
    things, a statement of claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is no reference in the text of Rule 20 to
    an “applicant”, who is defined in r. 1.03 as “a person who makes an application”
    or to a “respondent”</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'> </span><span lang=EN-US>who is defined in r. 1.03 as “a person against whom an
    application is made or an appeal is brought, as the circumstances require”.  Nor
    does the summary judgment rule mention a “notice of application”, which is the
    originating process for an application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The drafters of the summary judgment rule made a
    deliberate choice to restrict its availability to actions. There is a valid
    policy rationale for this restriction. Summary judgment is a simplified
    procedure, designed to determine all or part of an action in a summary manner,
    in order to reduce expense and preserve court resources. An application is also
    a summary process. Its use is restricted, pursuant to r. 14.05(3), to
    situations where an application is permitted under the <em>Rules</em><i> </i>or
    in cases where certain enumerated relief is claimed. Evidence is generally
    supplied through affidavits and cross-examinations conducted out of court.
    Where there is conflicting evidence that requires credibility determinations on
    central issues, the application must be converted to an action: see <em>Baker
    v. Chrysler Canada Ltd</em><i>.</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 729 (S.C.). If a
    proceeding is capable of being resolved as an application, it should be, as
    that is the most expeditious and least expensive determination of the
    proceeding on its merits. There is no utility in layering on to this summary
    process another summary process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is not a situation, as the respondents
    submit, where there is a lacuna in the <em>Rules</em> and the court is required
    to utilize r. 1.04 to interpret Rule 20 as if it applied to applications under
    Rule 14. Rule 38.10(1)(b) empowers a judge to order that all or part of an
    application proceed to trial. Pursuant to rr. 38.10(2) and (3), where the application
    judge orders that all or part of an application should proceed to trial, the
    proceeding is thereafter treated as an action in respect of the issues to be
    tried subject to the directions in the order directing a trial. The practical
    effect of r. 38.10 is that the summary judgment vehicle in Rule&nbsp;20 will be
    available to resolve the issues in a Rule 14 application after the application
    is converted by judicial order into an action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> With this analysis in mind, I turn to a
    consideration of whether the summary judgment rule was available to the parties
    and the court below. Newbould J. made an order that the claims of oppression
    and breach of contract should be determined through a mini-trial. Although Newbould
    J.’s order did not explicitly direct that the application proceed to trial, he
    had authority to make such an order pursuant to r. 38.l0(1)(b). </span></p>

    use of the summary judgment procedure and that both fully participated in the
    motion, any error in disposing of the limitation period issue by way of a
    motion for summary judgment was merely a procedural defect that caused no
    prejudice to the parties. Thus, I would not interfere with the motion judge’s
    decision on the procedural basis raised by the appellant in oral argument. </span></p>

    court found, at para. 536, that “[t]he trial judge exercised her discretion to
    apply her broad remedial authority to the pattern of oppressive conduct that

    the court held that no statutory limitation period was applicable and, in any

    were produced as part of the respondents’ disclosure on the cross-application

    the remedial nature of the oppression remedy and the fact that any threatened
    or actual conduct that is oppressive, or unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly
    disregards the interests of any complainant can constitute a discrete claim of
