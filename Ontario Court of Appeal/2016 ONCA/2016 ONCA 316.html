  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on December 13,
    2012 by Justice Joyce Elder of the Ontario Court of Justice, sitting without a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of the sexual assault of C.D. The Crown
    alleged that in 1984, he and K.I., the complainants cousin, had intercourse
    with the then-8-year-old complainant at her home while K.I. was babysitting
    her. The appellant was 13 years old at the time. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified at trial in 2012 that he was at the
    complainants home on one occasion when he was 13. He confirmed that K.I. was
    babysitting the complainant, and testified that K.I.s younger brother was also
    there. He recalled both K.I. and the younger brother going into the
    complainants bedroom, but denied knowing that a sexual assault had occurred,
    or that he had sexually assaulted the complainant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the appellant was not a credible witness and
    concluded that the appellants guilt had been established beyond a reasonable
    doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in two respects in coming to these conclusions:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She drew an adverse inference as to the appellants credibility
    from his pre-trial silence concerning the younger brothers presence; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She used K.I.s guilty plea to sexual assault of the complainant
    to corroborate the evidence of the complainant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that it would be an error to draw an adverse
    inference from an accuseds pre-trial silence, but submits that the trial judge
    did not draw such an inference. The Crown submits that the trial judge found
    that the appellant was not credible because of his selective memory and
    inconsistencies in his testimony about the younger brothers role in the
    incident. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judges reasons make it clear that she did, in fact, draw an
    adverse inference from the appellants pre-trial silence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I found [C.G.s] explanation for remembering K.I. and [the
    younger brother] going into the bedroom with the complainant difficult to
    follow. <span class=Underline>When this is coupled with his admission that he
    had never previously disclosed that K.I.s brother was there and might have
    been involved, I do not find C.G. to be a credible witness.</span> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was an error. The trial judge also erred in using K.I.s guilty plea
    to corroborate the evidence of the complainant. Had K.I. been available to be called
    as a witness  which he was not, as he died before the appellants trial  his
    guilty plea would have been relevant to his credibility and to his own involvement
    in the sexual assault. However, a guilty plea by a co-accused, not called at
    trial, cannot be used to support the Crowns case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, in <em>R. v.</em><em> </em><em>C. (P.)</em>, 2015 ONCA 30, 321
    C.C.C. (3d) 49, a young offender was tried separately from four adults on a
    charge that he had aided and abetted a murder. The four adults pleaded guilty 
    one to murder, two to manslaughter, and one to aggravated assault. The trial
    judge instructed the jury that the guilty plea to murder by one of the four adults
    could be used as evidence against the accused. On appeal, this court held, at
    paras. 43-46, that the trial judge had erred:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The trial judge explained that the determination that Xiao had
    committed murder was the logical first step in deciding whether the appellant
    had aided and abetted Xiao in committing an unlawful act. She told the jury
    they could use that plea and conviction to conclude that Xiao had committed
    murder. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The trial judge erred in law when she told the jury that it
    could use Xiaos guilty plea and conviction as evidence against the appellant.
    See <em>R. v. Simpson</em>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3; <em>R. v. MacGregor</em> (1981),
    64 C.C.C. (2d) 353 (Ont. C.A.); <em>R. v. Pentiluk </em>(1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d)
    87 (C.A.), at 92.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Xiaos guilty plea was no more than hearsay evidence that Xiao
    had committed murder, and could not be considered in determining the
    appellants guilt. In <em>R. v. MacGregor,</em> Martin J.A. said, at pp.
    357-58:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>Admittedly, it was an error for the trial judge to fail to
    instruct the jury that in considering the case against the appellant they
    should disregard the pleas of guilty of manslaughter by the co-accused and that
    those pleas were not in any way to be taken into account in considering the
    case against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This statement of the law was adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>R.
    v. Simpson</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, it was an error for the trial
    judge to rely on K.I.s guilty plea as support for the complainants version of
    events.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    that this case turned on credibility, the Crown has not established that the
    verdict would necessarily have been the same without the two errors identified
    above  one error undermining the appellants credibility, the other enhancing
    the complainants credibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside, and a new trial
    ordered. </p>
