  <p class=Onappealfrom>Motions for leave to appeal from the judgment of Justice Frank
    J.C. Newbould of the Superior Court of Justice, dated May 12, 2015 and July 6,
    2015, with reasons reported at 2015 ONSC 2987, 27 C.B.R. (6th) 175, and 2015
    ONSC 4170, 27 C.B.R. (6th) 51.</p>
  <p class=Heading>BY THE COURT:</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>January 14, 2009 was not a good day.  At that time, Nortel Networks
    Corp. (“NNC”) and the other Nortel Canadian Debtors filed for insolvency protection
    under the <em>Companies Creditors’ Arrangement Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (“<i>CCAA</i>”). 
    That same day, Nortel Networks Inc. (“NNI”) and other U.S. Debtors filed voluntary
    petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>U.S.</span></em><em> Bankruptcy Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 11 U.S.C. </span></em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>§§</span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>1101
    – 1174,</span></em> and other Nortel entities incorporated in Europe, the
    Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) were placed under administration in England by
    the High Court of England and Wales under the U.K. <em>Insolvency Act</em> <i>1986</i>,
    c. 45. Shortly afterwards, courts in Canada and the United States approved a
    cross-border, court-to-court protocol that established procedures for the co-ordination
    of cross-border proceedings in Canada and the U.S.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More than seven years later, many Januarys have come and gone and these insolvency
    proceedings continue.  During that time: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>more
    than 6,800 Nortel former employees or pensioners have died;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>well
    in excess of $1 billion has been incurred in costs; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nortel’s
    assets have been sold and some $7.3 billion<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> in sale proceeds have been placed in escrow (the “Lockbox Funds”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The leave motions now before this court arise from the joint trial
    dealing with the allocation of the Lockbox Funds. Newbould J. (the “trial
    judge) of Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) and Judge Gross
    of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware presided over the
    joint trial.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> It was held over the course of six weeks.  Each judge rendered separate
    decisions on May 12, 2015.  Each concluded that the Lockbox Funds should be
    allocated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis among the various Nortel debtor estates. 
    Although their analysis differed somewhat, the outcome was the same.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appeal proceedings were initiated in Canada and the U.S. The moving
    parties were authorized to file their leave materials in the absence of an
    issued judgment on the basis that counsel would subsequently file the formal
    judgment. The formal judgment was issued on April 26, 2016 and filed with this
    court on April 27, 2016.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this court, the six moving parties, led by the U.S. Debtors, seek
    leave to appeal the trial judge’s judgment pursuant to s. 13 of the <i>CCAA</i>.
    They submit that the trial judge made fundamental errors and that the proposed
    appeal is of significance to the practice of insolvency and to the parties, and
    will not delay the completion of the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The responding parties, led by the Board of the Pension Protection Fund
    and Nortel Networks UK Pension Trust Limited (“UKPC”), submit that the record
    supports the trial judge’s factual findings, which were integral to his
    analysis, including his findings that Nortel’s assets were jointly created, that
    the Nortel group of companies operated on a fully-integrated global basis and that
    Nortel did not operate separate businesses in separate countries. In their
    submission, the proposed appeal is not <em>prima facie</em> meritorious. In
    addition, the remaining elements of the test for leave to appeal under the <em>CCAA</em> have not all been met.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After consideration of each of the factums<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> and other materials filed on the leave motions, we agree with the responding parties
    that the test for leave has not been met. For the reasons that follow, we
    dismiss the moving parties’ motions for leave to appeal. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Genesis of Dispute  </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NNC was a publicly-traded Canadian corporation at the helm of a global
    networking solutions and telecommunications business, and the direct or
    indirect parent of more than 130 subsidiaries located in more than 100
    countries.  These companies were collectively referred to as the “Nortel Group”
    or “Nortel”.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NNC was the successor to a long line of companies, headquartered in
    Canada, that date back to the founding of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada
    in 1883.  NNC’s principal, direct operating subsidiary was Nortel Networks
    Limited (“NNL”), also a Canadian company.  NNL was the direct or indirect parent
    of operating companies located around the world. It owned 100 percent of the
    equity of  each of the following entities: NNI, Nortel’s operating company in
    the United States; Nortel Networks UK Ltd. (“NNUK”), Nortel’s operating company
    in the United Kingdom; and, Nortel Networks (Ireland) Ltd. (“NN Ireland”),
    Nortel’s operating company in Ireland. It also owned 91.17 per cent of the
    equity of  Nortel Networks S.A. (“NNSA”), Nortel’s operating company in France.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the insolvency filings, Nortel’s initial plan was to downsize
    and carry on portions of the telecommunications business.  However, by June
    2009, the decision was made to liquidate Nortel’s assets.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 29, 2009, an Interim Funding and Settlement Agreement (“IFSA”)
    was approved by both the Canadian and American courts.  Among other things, it
    addressed interim funding for NNL and the anticipated sales of Nortel’s business
    lines and residual intellectual property (“IP”).  The parties, consisting of
    the Canadian Debtors, the U.S. Debtors<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a>,
    and the EMEA Debtors<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[8]</span></span></span></a>,
    agreed to cooperate with the sales process and also agreed that the proceeds of
    sale would be held in escrow. The issue of allocation was deferred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the IFSA, there would be no distribution out of escrow without
    “either (i) agreement of all of the Selling Debtors<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[9]</span></span></span></a> or (ii) … determination by the relevant dispute resolver(s) under the terms of
    the Protocol … applicable to the Sale Proceeds”.  The parties were then to
    negotiate and attempt to reach agreement “on a protocol for resolving disputes
    concerning the allocation of Sale Proceeds from Sale Transactions (the “Interim
    Sales Protocol”)”. Despite numerous attempts at resolution, agreement on both an
    Interim Sales Protocol and allocation proved to be elusive.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, over $7 billion was generated from various asset sales and
    other realizations.  From mid-2009 until March 2011, proceeds of $3.285 billion
    were generated from the sale of Nortel’s various business lines, including some
    patents. Of that amount, $2.85 billion is available for allocation. In June
    2011, proceeds of approximately $4.5 billion were generated from the sale of Nortel’s
    residual intellectual property, consisting of approximately 7,000 patents and patent
    applications, to the Rockstar consortium.  In total, approximately $7.3 billion
    is currently held in escrow.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By orders dated January 21, 2010, the Canadian and U.S. courts approved
    a “Final Canadian Funding and Settlement Agreement”. The Agreement addressed a
    number of issues and allowed NNI a $2 billion claim against NNL in NNL’s <i>CCAA </i>proceeding, which claim is not subject to offset or counterclaims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties still could not agree on an Interim Sales Protocol or on allocation. 
    In the spring of 2013, the Canadian court and the U.S. bankruptcy court granted
    orders approving an “Allocation Protocol”.  The purpose of this Protocol was to
    set out “binding procedures for determining the allocation of the Sale Proceeds
    among the Selling Debtors”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]</span></span></span></a>.
    It provided for a joint hearing to determine allocation before the Canadian

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span

  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial Judge’s Decision</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Trial Decision</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons may be summarized. He commenced by reviewing
    the history of the Nortel Group.  He described the operations and the four main
    product groups or lines of business.  Before turning to his analysis of the
    legal issues, he made a number of important findings about the Nortel Group’s
    structure. He found, and repeatedly reiterated, that the Nortel Group operated
    as a highly-integrated multinational enterprise.  For instance, he stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[<a name=par16>16</a>]<span style='font-size:7.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Nortel Group operated along business lines as a highly integrated
    multinational enterprise with a matrix structure that transcended geographic
    boundaries and legal entities organized around the world.&nbsp; Each entity,
    such as NNL, NNI, NNUK, NN Ireland and NNSA, was integrated into regional and
    product line management structures to share information and perform research
    and development (“R&amp;D”), sales and other common functions across geographic
    boundaries and across legal entities.&nbsp; The matrix structure was designed
    to enable Nortel to function more efficiently, drawing on employees from
    different functional disciplines worldwide, allowing them to work together to
    develop products and attract and provide service to customers, fulfilling their
    demands globally.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[<a name=par17>17</a>]<span style='font-size:7.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;</span>As a result of Nortel’s matrix structure, no single Nortel entity,
    either NNL or any of the other Canadian debtors in Canada, NNI or any of the
    other US debtors in the United States or NNUK or any of the other EMEA debtors,
    was able to provide the full line of Nortel products and services, including R&amp;D
    capabilities, on a stand-alone basis. While Nortel ensured that all corporate
    entities complied with local laws regarding corporate governance, no corporate
    entity carried on business on its own.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found that R&amp;D, which was performed at labs
    around the world, was the primary driver of Nortel’s value and profit.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the necessary background, the trial judge turned to the legal
    issues before him, starting with the interpretation of the Master Research and
    Development Agreement (“MRDA”). The MRDA dealt with transfer-pricing arrangements,
    effective from 2001 onwards, among NNL, NNI, NNUK, NNSA and NN Ireland, who
    were parties to the agreement.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[12]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties took differing and competing positions on the meaning and
    application of the MRDA: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The Monitor (on behalf of the Canadian Debtors), supported by the
    Canadian Creditors’ Committee (“CCC”), took the position that under the MRDA,
    NNL owned the IP whereas other participants to the MRDA were simply licensees. 
    They argued that the proceeds derived from the sale of the residual IP belonged
    exclusively to NNL.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The U.S. Debtors and other U.S. interests, including the
    Bondholders, argued that NNI and the other licensees held all of the rights and
    value in the IP in their respective exclusive territories as defined in the
    MRDA.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The EMEA Debtors asserted that parties to the MRDA jointly owned
    all of the IP in proportion to their financial contributions to R&amp;D and
    that all should share in the sale proceeds attributable to IP in those same
    proportions.  The joint ownership arose independent of, but was recognized in,
    the MRDA. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The UKPC took the position that the MRDA should not govern
    allocation and that a <i>pro rata</i> allocation based on a <i>pari passu </i>distribution
    should be used. The CCC also adopted this as its alternative position.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that, by its terms, the MRDA was to be construed
    in accordance with, and governed by, Ontario law. He reviewed the applicable
    principles of contractual interpretation, including the law on factual matrix (surrounding
    circumstances), commercial reasonableness, and recitals. In reviewing the law,
    he considered the recent authority from the Supreme Court of Canada on
    contractual interpretation, <em>Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.</em>,
    2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, which was released during the course of the
    trial. He considered in detail the parties’ positions, the language of the MRDA
    and evidence on factual matrix.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He concluded that the MRDA was an operating agreement and was not
    intended to, nor did it, deal with the disposal of all of Nortel’s assets in a
    situation in which no revenue was being earned and no profits or losses were
    occurring. Rather, he found that the MRDA was developed for, and driven by,
    transfer-pricing concepts for tax purposes and did not govern allocation after
    Nortel ceased operations:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='background:white'>[<a name=par177>177</a>]</span><span style='font-size:
7.0pt;background:white'>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='background:white'>I
    accept that the MRDA was a transfer pricing document created for tax purposes.
    The licenses were a part of it. The licenses granted under it were never dealt
    with separately from the MRDA. Their only purpose was to support the intended
    tax treatment resulting from the MRDA.</span>   </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>[<a name=par185>185</a>]</span><span
style='font-size:7.0pt;background:white'>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='background:white'>I
    conclude that the circumstances surrounding the creation of the MRDA lead to no
    other result but that the construct of legal title to the NN Technology being
    in NNL in return for NNL granting exclusive licenses to the Licensed
    Participants was only for the purpose of supporting the proposed method to
    split profits or losses on a tax efficient basis while Nortel operated as a
    going concern business. The agreement in its application was intended to apply
    only to Nortel while it operated and not to deal with rights after Nortel and its
    subsidiaries stopped operating its businesses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, he rejected the primary positions of the Monitor, the CCC, the
    U.S. Debtors and other U.S. interests, as well as the EMEA Debtors’ joint
    ownership theory. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found that the MRDA did not govern allocation on Nortel’s
    insolvency and having rejected the joint ownership theory, the trial judge turned
    to the metric to be used to allocate the Lockbox Funds. He found that the
    intangible assets that were sold were not separately located or owned in any one
    jurisdiction.  Rather, they were created by all of the so-called “Residual
    Profit Entities” or “RPEs” (namely, NNL, NNI, NNUK, NNSA and NN Ireland), which
    were located in different jurisdictions. In addition, the matrix structure
    allowed Nortel to draw on employees from different functional disciplines
    worldwide, regardless of region or country, according to need.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He held that NNL was not entitled to the proceeds of sale simply because
    the patents were in its name:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>[<a name=par197>197</a>]</span><span
style='font-size:7.0pt;background:white'>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><span style='background:white'>This
    was not one corporation and one set of employees inventing IP that led to
    patents. Nortel was a highly integrated multi-national enterprise with all RPEs
    doing R&amp;D that led to patents being granted. It was R&amp;D that drove
    Nortel’s business. R&amp;D and the intellectual property created from it was
    the primary driver of Nortel’s value and profits. All parties agree on that. It
    would unjustly enrich NNL to deprive all of the other RPEs of the work that
    they did in creating the IP just because the patents were registered in NNL’s
    name.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He determined that he had wide powers under the <em>CCAA</em><i> </i>to
    do what was just in the circumstances. Section 11 of the <em>CCAA</em>, which
    reflected prior  jurisprudence, expressly provides that a court may make any
    order it considers appropriate in the circumstances, subject to the provisions
    of the Act. He wrote: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[208] In this case, insolvency practitioners, academics,
    international bodies, and others have watched as Nortel’s early success in
    maximizing the value of its global assets through cooperation has disintegrated
    into value-erosive adversarial and territorial litigation described by many as
    scorched earth litigation. The costs have well exceeded $1 billion. A global
    solution in this unprecedented situation is required and perforce, as this
    situation has not been faced before, it will by its nature involve innovation.
    Our courts have such jurisdiction. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He observed that it is a fundamental tenet of insolvency law that all
    debts be paid <em>pari passu</em> and that all unsecured creditors receive
    equal treatment. In his view, a <em>pro rata</em> allocation could be achieved
    by directing an allocation of the Lockbox Funds to each Debtor Estate based on
    the percentage that the claims against that Estate bore to the total claims
    against all of the Debtor Estates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge dealt with the argument
    that a <i>pro rata</i> allocation would amount to substantive consolidation. He
    concluded that a <i>pro rata</i> allocation would not constitute substantive
    consolidation in the unique circumstances of this case. In any event, even if
    it were substantive consolidation, there was precedent that justified substantive
    consolidation in this case: <em>Re Lehndorff General Partner Ltd.</em> <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, he concluded that the Lockbox Funds were to be allocated on
    a <i>pro rata</i> basis in accordance with certain governing principles, which
    are outlined below. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After his reasons were released, the U.S. Debtors supported by the
    Official Committee, the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders and the Law Debenture Trust
    Company of New York filed motions for clarification, reconsideration or amendment
    in Canada and the U.S. and a number of points were clarified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In the end result, the judgment that was signed, issued and entered on
    April 26, 2016 provided that the allocation proceed on a <em>pro rata</em> basis in accordance with the following principles: </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 13 of the <em>CCAA</em> provides that any person dissatisfied

    decision with leave.  Leave to appeal is granted sparingly in <i>CCAA</i> proceedings and only where there are serious and arguable grounds that are of
    real and significant interest to the parties. In addressing whether leave

  <p class=CQuote>(b) the points on the proposed appeal are of significance to

    because the appeal is <em>prima facie</em> meritorious. In making that
    argument, they raise three main issues – substantive consolidation, the
    interpretation of the MRDA, and questions of fairness. We will deal with each
    issue in turn.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Substantive consolidation</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Position of the Moving Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the moving parties submit that the trial judge erred in not
    recognizing that the allocation ordered departed from “corporate separateness”
    and was a form of substantive consolidation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, it is alleged that the trial judge erred by applying an inappropriately
    low threshold for the application of substantive consolidation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its supplementary factum, the Bank of New York Mellon, as Indenture
    Trustee, makes a related argument. It submits that since the Nortel proceeding
    no longer involves a restructuring, the <i>CCAA</i>’s purpose is spent and the
    proceeds should thereafter be distributed under the <em>Bankruptcy and
    Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”), or at least in a
    manner consistent with the <em>BIA</em> scheme. It says the <em>BIA</em> does
    not contemplate consolidation but rather distribution on an entity-by-entity
    basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders makes a related argument. It submits
    that the allocation decision takes property interests that belong to certain
    debtor estates and gives them to others. They argue that, even though the
    authority provided under s. 11 is broad, the <i>CCAA</i> does not permit a
    court to redistribute property in this way.  </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties’ arguments on substantive consolidation are not <em>prima
    facie</em> meritorious.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Professor Janis Sarra, a leading expert on insolvency law in Canada,
    describes substantive consolidation in her article “Corporate Group
    Insolvencies: Seeing the Forest and the Trees” (2008) 24 B.F.L.R. 63, at pp. 80
    - 81:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Substantive consolidation essentially treats member entities of
    a corporate group as one entity.  In the context of liquidation, it creates a
    common pool of assets to meet creditors’ claims.  In the context of
    restructuring, it may create the opportunity for creditors to share in the
    future upside potential of a restructured entity or entities by centralizing
    and negotiating an arrangement in respect of their claims.  Canadian courts
    have recognized substantive consolidation under both the <em>BIA</em> and the <em>CCAA</em> where there is evidence of intertwined assets and liabilities; integrated
    administrative functioning and operations; a perception by creditors that they
    are dealing with an integrated entity; common control and governance structures;
    where it would be impracticable to separate the affairs of related entities;
    where it is more cost effective and beneficial to creditors to have the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have noted, the trial judge concluded that <em>pro rata</em><i> </i>allocation
    was appropriate, that it did not amount to substantive consolidation, and that even
    if it could be said that a <em>pro rata</em> allocation involved substantive
    consolidation, it was not precluded by law in the unique circumstances of the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span

    Nortel entities”: para. 222.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to his factual findings supporting the <em>pro rata</em> order,
    the trial judge explained why the allocation in this case did not constitute
    substantive consolidation, either actual or deemed: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The Lockbox Funds were largely due to the sale of IP and no one
    Debtor Estate had any right to the funds. They did not belong in whole or in
    part to any one Estate or combination of Estates.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The various entities and the various Estates were not being
    treated as one entity and the creditors of each entity would not become
    creditors of a single entity. Each entity remained separate and with its own
    creditors. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Each entity would maintain its own cash on hand and would be
    administered separately. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The inter-company claims would not be eliminated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Judge Gross explained at p. 554 of his reasons that the <em>pro
    rata</em><i> </i>allocation, which was not a distribution, “both recognizes the
    integrity of the corporate separateness and the integrated synergistic
    operations of Nortel.” Furthermore, he noted that a “pro rata allocation does
    not merge the Nortel Debtors into a single survivor and does not erase
    intercompany claims”: p. 554.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, there is no <em>prima facie</em><i> </i>merit to the
    argument that we should interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the
    allocation decision did not amount to substantive consolidation. His conclusion
    was based on the nature and effect of his allocation decision and his factual
    findings. He made the findings having heard from 36 witnesses and having
    received and reviewed thousands of exhibits and dozens of deposition
    transcripts over the course of a six-week trial. Those factual findings were
    central to the result. Absent palpable and overriding error, those factual
    findings are afforded deference by this court: <em>Housen v. Nikolaisen</em>,
    2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 10.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties also allege that the trial judge erred by applying an
    inappropriately low threshold for the application of substantive consolidation in
    finding that, even if the allocation did constitute substantive consolidation,
    it was permissible. They point to <em>Northland</em> as the leading authority
    on substantive consolidation but say that it is time to revisit that decision
    in Canada.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge correctly observed that while the <i>CCAA</i> does not
    expressly address the issue of substantive consolidation, jurisprudence in
    Canada has recognized substantive consolidation as being appropriate in certain
    exceptional circumstances: see, for e.g., <i>Re <em>Lehndorff General Partner
    Ltd.</em></i><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em><em>Re PSINet</em> <i>Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Re <em>Northland Properties Ltd.</em></i> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also correctly observed that the court has jurisdiction to make any
    order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances under s. 11 of the <i>CCAA</i>.
    Although that section came into effect after the Nortel filing under the <i>CCAA</i>,
    it reflects past jurisprudence: <em>Century Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</em>, <span class=sccrespondentforindexchar><span style='background:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, since there is no <em>prima facie</em> merit to the argument
    that the <em>pro rata</em> allocation constitutes substantive consolidation, there
    is no need to re-visit the jurisprudence governing substantive consolidation in
    Canada or to consider whether the threshold for substantive consolidation
    should be changed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, we see no merit in the argument raised by the Bank of New
    York Mellon that the trial judge erred by failing to allocate the Lockbox Funds
    in a  manner consistent with the <em>BIA</em><i> </i>scheme, which contemplates
    distribution on an entity-by-entity basis. Under the <em>CCAA</em> allocation decision,
    distribution to creditors will be done on an entity-by-entity basis.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the argument raised by the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders and the
    Official Committee also lacks merit. It presumes that the various Nortel
    companies had distinct and separable property rights in Nortel’s IP. The trial
    judge repeatedly rejected that proposition. As we explain in the following
    sections, we see no merit in the argument that the trial judge erred in failing
    to recognize such distinct property rights. As such, we see no merit in the
    argument that he exercised his authority in a way that ignored such rights. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This ground of appeal is not <em>prima facie</em> meritorious.</p>

    concluding that the MRDA has no application to the allocation of the Lockbox Funds.
    On their reading, the MRDA provides NNI and other “Integrated Entities” with
    valuable rights to Nortel’s IP in their respective exclusive jurisdictions. They
    note that the trial judge and Judge Gross diverged on the issue of IP rights
    under the MRDA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thrust of their contractual argument is two-fold: (1) the trial
    judge misinterpreted the MRDA by disregarding the words of the agreement; and
    (2) he failed to apply the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em>Sattva</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> by taking an impermissibly narrow view of the scope
    of factual matrix evidence</span></em>. In particular, they submit that the
    trial judge failed to take into account evidence relating to, and explaining,
    the tax-driven nature of the MRDA and the purposes the parties were trying to
    achieve through the agreement.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span

    MRDA. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 1, 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada released <em>Sattva</em>.
     The essence of that decision is best captured by excerpts from the reasons of
    the court written by Rothstein J.:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>“Historically, determining the legal rights and obligations of

    These principles also weigh in favour of deference to first instance
    decision-makers on points of contractual interpretation. The legal obligations
    arising from a contract are, in most cases, limited to the interest of the
    particular parties. Given that our legal system leaves broad scope to tribunals
    of first instance to resolve issues of limited application, this supports
    treating contractual interpretation as a question of mixed fact and law”: para.
    52.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>“[I]t may be possible to identify an extricable question of law
    from within what was initially characterized as a question of mixed fact and
    law …. Legal errors made in the course of contractual interpretation include ‘the
    application of an incorrect principle, the failure to consider a required
    element of a legal test, or the failure to consider a relevant factor’”: para.
    53. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>“However, courts should be cautious in identifying extricable

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Rothstein also discussed the need to consider the surrounding
    circumstances, or factual matrix of a contract, when interpreting a written
    agreement. The goal of contractual interpretation is to ascertain the objective
    intentions of the parties.  In doing so, “a decision-maker must read the
    contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical
    meaning, consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at
    the time of formation of the contract”: para. 47. Recognizing that words do not
    have an immutable meaning, the court should consider the contract’s commercial
    purpose, taking into account its genesis, background, context, and the market
    in which the parties are operating. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the moving parties suggest that the trial judge erred in
    his interpretation of the MRDA and failed to pay heed to <em>Sattva</em>.  In
    our view, the moving parties’ arguments are not <em>prima facie</em> meritorious. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded that there is any reason to interfere with the
    trial judge’s interpretation of the agreement on the basis of palpable and
    overriding error. Nor, in our view, have the moving parties pointed to any
    extricable legal error warranting intervention by this court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, although <em>Sattva</em> was released during the course of
    the allocation trial, the trial judge nonetheless considered and applied <em>Sattva</em> in interpreting the MRDA.  In over 40 paragraphs, he addressed the relevant law
    on, and evidence of, factual matrix: see paras. 55 – 57, 117 – 157.  He
    properly rejected evidence of subjective intention as being inadmissible.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would also observe that, as noted by the Monitor and the Canadian
    Debtors, to be fully successful on their appeal, the U.S. Debtors would have to
    persuade the court that the trial judge should have: (i) concluded that the
    MRDA controlled allocation of Nortel’s assets in the event of insolvency; (ii)
    adopted the interpretation of the MRDA advanced by the U.S. Debtors; and (iii)
    accepted the expert valuation evidence tendered by the U.S. Debtors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did none of these things. All of his conclusions to the
    contrary engage questions of fact or mixed fact and law that are well within
    his province. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For instance, the trial judge rejected the U.S. Debtors’ valuation
    evidence as unreliable and the moving parties’ factums are silent on how this
    finding could be overcome. The acceptance or rejection of the evidence of a
    witness is squarely within the fact-finding arena of the trial judge.  The
    moving parties have suggested no reason why the trial judge’s findings on
    valuation would be reversed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, this ground of appeal does not warrant granting leave to
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairness to the Parties and Related Arguments</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Position of Moving Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, the moving parties submit that they were denied procedural
    fairness in various respects and that the allocation decision is, among other
    things, arbitrary, and inequitable. In this regard, we do not propose to
    address every argument in the multitude of factums filed. The principal
    submissions on fairness and related arguments that merit comment are as
    follows.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties say they were given no notice or opportunity to make
    submissions on the remedy granted.  Moreover, there was no record before the
    court on the full spectrum of claims asserted against the Selling Debtors and
    no one proposed the specific remedy granted.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The U.S. Debtors also submit that the remedy did not respond to the
    question before the court, which they say was the allocation of the Sale
    Proceeds (i.e. the proceeds from a particular Sale Transaction) among the
    Selling Debtors (i.e. the Nortel parties to a particular Sale Transaction). In
    their view, the trial judge did not answer that question but instead allocated
    the Sale Proceeds to Nortel entities that did not transfer assets in a
    particular Sale Transaction and were, thus, not entitled to any Sale Proceeds. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders similarly submits that the trial judge
    answered the wrong question. For instance, it says that the only question
    properly before the court was to determine the relative value of the assets,
    rights and interests that each Selling Debtor sold or relinquished, which
    generated the Sale Proceeds.  Moreover, they say that the decision disregards their
    legitimate expectations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The U.S. Debtors further submit that the allocation is arbitrary since
    there is no logical connection between what will be or will not be counted for
    allocation purposes. In particular, they point to the fact the allocation
    excludes $4 billion in bondholder guarantee claims from the U.S. Debtors’
    allocation. They say that, as a result, the U.S. Debtors will receive no
    allocation of funds on account of approximately two-thirds of their claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders submits the allocation is
    arbitrary as it produces a redistribution of assets among debtors that violates
    the rule that equity holders get paid after creditors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Conflicts Administrator of NNSA also takes issue with the fairness
    of the allocation decision. It says that NNSA is prejudiced by the decision because
    of the relatively small quantum of its creditors’ claims in comparison with
    those of other debtor estates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Official Committee, which represents all general unsecured
    creditors of the U.S. Debtors, complains that the trial judge exercised his
    discretion in an unprincipled way and strayed into improper “commercial judicial
    moralism”.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not satisfied that there is <em>prima facie</em> merit to the
    moving parties’ submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained, the trial judge was required to “determine the allocation
    of the Sale Proceeds among the Selling Debtors” under the Allocation Protocol. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the trial judge’s conclusion that the MRDA did not govern
    allocation and his rejection of the EMEA Debtors’ joint ownership theory, the
    trial judge had to determine what other metric should be used to allocate the Lockbox
    Funds among the U.S., Canadian and EMEA Debtor Estates. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Allocation Protocol permitted submissions on “any theory of
    allocation”. At trial, the UKPC and the CCC, in the alternative, sought a <em>pro
    rata</em> distribution of the funds held in escrow and each submitted expert
    reports that supported a <em>pro rata</em> result. Moreover, the U.S. Debtors,
    the Official Committee and the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders all made submissions
    before the trial judge opposing a <i>pro rata</i> allocation and had an
    opportunity to test the evidence. They submitted a motion to strike the <em>pro
    rata</em> allocation evidence, attacked the reliability of the expert reports
    and cross-examined the experts.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, all parties knew that a <em>pro rata</em> allocation was in play. The
    fact that the specifics of the allocation ordered by the trial judge were not
    identical to those advanced by any of the parties does not, in our view, create
    unfairness to the parties. This is not a situation where the trial judge addressed
    an issue that was not before him, failed to grapple with the arguments or
    evidence, or came up with a new theory of the case.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two judges were not required to determine value but allocation. The IFSA
    provided for a right to receive an allocation of the Sale Proceeds without
    restricting the basis upon which that allocation might be determined by the two
    courts. In particular, we note that the trial judges were given authority to
    decide the issue of allocation. In addition to the terms of the Allocation Protocol,
    we note s.10(a) of the IFSA: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]his Agreement is not, and shall not be deemed to be, an
    acknowledgement by any Party of the assumption, ratification, adoption or
    rejection of the Transfer Pricing Agreements or any other Transfer Pricing
    methodology employed by the Nortel Group or its individual members for any
    purpose <span class=Underline>nor shall it be determinative of, or have any
    impact whatsoever on, the allocation of proceeds to any Debtor from any sale of
    assets of the Nortel Group</span>; [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also observe that the trial judge turned his mind to expectations and
    found that there was no evidence to support the Bondholders’ argument that
    their legitimate expectations would be disregarded by a <em>pro rata</em> allocation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, we see no basis for the assertion that the allocation
    framework is arbitrary and unfair since it excludes $4 billion in Bondholder
    guarantee claims from the U.S. Debtors’ allocation. Under the allocation
    decision, a claim that can be made against more than one Debtor Estate can only
    be calculated and recognized once for allocation purposes. This principle is
    applicable to all claims. The allocation decision also specifies that claims on
    bonds are to be made on the Debtor Estate of the issuer. Claims on those bonds
    may also be made on the Debtor Estate of the guarantor but those claims will
    not be taken into account in determining the claims against the Debtor Estates
    for allocation purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the reconsideration motion, it was argued that the trial judge’s decision
    should be changed to provide that the claims by the bondholders on the
    guaranteed bonds against the issuer and guarantor Debtor Estates should be
    included in the claims for allocation purposes. It was contended that, without
    such a change, there would be a manifest injustice, especially to the creditors
    of the U.S. Debtors other than the bondholders.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected that argument, noting that the $2 billion
    admitted claim against NNL endures. Further, cash on hand in the U.S. Debtors’
    Estates would be available to their creditors. He also noted that the issue of
    the treatment of the guaranteed bonds, and whether they should be counted once
    or twice in a <i>pro rata</i> allocation, was a live issue in evidence at trial,
    which was open to the U.S. Debtors to explore. He found, at para. 16, that “any
    lack of briefing by the U.S. Debtors and the [Official Committee] was a
    deliberate tactic taken by them in attacking the pro rata allocation method
    proposed at trial”. He concluded that, even if he were to reconsider the
    double-counting issue, he would not change his mind:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='color:black;background:white'>I see no injustice
    in the result…. There must also be considered other claims that could be made
    against more than one Debtor Estate, including the pension claim by the UKPC
    against NNUK that could be made against other EMEA Debtors and claims that
    could be made on bonds issued by NNL and guaranteed by NNC. The allocation
    decision precludes the double counting of any such claims for allocation
    purposes. The U.S. Debtors and [Official Committee] do not suggest that any of
    these other claims should be permitted to be claimed twice for allocation
    purposes. I see no basis to treat the guaranteed bonds any differently for
    allocation purposes. The principles that govern allocation should be applied
    consistently to each debtor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded that there is <em>prima facie</em> merit to the
    argument that the allocation is arbitrary. The trial judge was clearly alive to
    the fairness concerns and gave reasons for adopting the approach he did after
    careful consideration of the evidence and argument at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would also observe that there was no other clear answer to the
    question of who was entitled to receive the sale proceeds. As Judge Gross noted
    at p. 500 of his reasons, the parties “submitted widely varying approaches for
    deciding the issue leaving virtually no middle ground.” The U.S. Debtors and
    Bondholders argued that in excess of $5 billion belonged to the U.S. Estate and
    that the Canadian Estate should receive only $0.77 billion. The Canadian
    Debtors and the Monitor, in sharp contrast, argued that in excess of $6 billion
    belonged to the Canadian Estate and that the U.S. Estate should receive just
    over $1 billion. The highly integrated nature of the Nortel business operations
    and the nature of the assets sold defied either outcome.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judge Gross’s comments in his reasons on the allocation trial, at pp.
    532-533, accurately sum up the context in which the two courts came to adopt
    the <em>pro rata</em> allocation approach:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Court is convinced that where, as here, operating entities
    in an integrated, multi-national enterprise developed assets in common and
    there is nothing in the law or facts giving any of those entities certain and
    calculable claims to the proceeds from the liquidation of those assets in an
    enterprise-wide insolvency, adopting a pro rata allocation approach, which
    recognizes inter-company and settlement related claims and cash in hand, yields
    the most acceptable result.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is nothing in the law or facts of this case which weighs
    in favour of adopting one of the wide ranging approaches of the Debtors.  There
    is no uniform code or international treaty or binding agreement which governs
    how Nortel is to allocate the Sales Proceeds between the various insolvency
    estates or subsidiaries spread across the globe.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor are we satisfied that there is <em>prima facie</em> merit to the Official
    Committee’s argument that the trial judge exercised his discretion in an
    unprincipled way by straying into improper “commercial judicial moralism”. To
    the extent the Official Committee is suggesting that it amounts to judicial
    moralism when a judge takes into account fairness concerns, we reject that
    argument. The trial judge considered the evidence before him in considerable
    detail and worked with the facts presented to him.  Based on those facts, he
    concluded that a <em>pro rata</em><i> </i>order constituted the answer to the
    allocation issue. The fact that the answer is also fair should not detract from
    the force of his conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we are not persuaded that there is any merit to the argument
    that the allocation violates the rule that equity holders get paid after
    creditors. The Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders submits that the trial judge’s
    decision results in NNL (NNI’s parent company) receiving allocation proceeds
    from the sale of NNI’s assets and rights that ought to have been allocated to
    the NNI estate for the benefit of NNI’s creditors. This argument is premised on
    NNI having a right to the particular proceeds as a result of the MRDA
    interpretation advanced by the U.S. Debtors and Bondholders. As we have
    discussed above, the trial judge rejected that argument. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, we conclude that none of the fairness and related arguments
    put forward by the moving parties are <em>prima facie</em> meritorious.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significance of Issues to the Practice</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Position of Moving Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties submit that the trial judge’s decision presents
    important issues of first impression in the cross-border insolvency context. They
    submit that, without appellate intervention, there is a risk substantive
    consolidation will become far more widely available. In addition, they say that
    it creates significant uncertainty on the separation of subsidiaries within a
    corporate group and on the consequences of an insolvency proceeding on the
    rights of stakeholders, including creditors. In their submission, an appeal would
    permit this court to clarify these issues.  Furthermore, the appeal would allow
    this court to clarify the proper interpretation and effect of <em>Sattva</em> on commercial agreements.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As discussed above, the moving parties have raised three main issues
    they say warrant leave – namely, substantive consolidation, the interpretation
    of the MRDA, and fairness. Of the three issues, the moving parties submit that
    the first two raise issues of significant interest to the practice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of this case are unique and exceptional. As we have already
    discussed, substantive consolidation is not engaged and so this case would not
    provide an opportunity for this court to provide guidance on that question. Nor
    does this case engage any issues that require any clarification on the
    application of <i>Sattva</i>. In short, granting leave would not provide an
    opportunity for this court to provide guidance on legal issues of significance to
    the practice. </p>
  <h5>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Significance
    of Issues to the Action</h5>
  <p class=LHeading11>Position of Moving Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties state that the allocation of the Lockbox Funds is the
    overriding issue in the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11 style='page-break-after:avoid'>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept that the allocation of the Lockbox Funds is a significant
    issue in this <i>CCAA</i> proceeding. That said, we are of the view that,
    standing alone, this factor is insufficient to warrant granting leave to
    appeal.  To perhaps state the obvious, typically parties tend to seek leave to
    appeal a decision that is of significance to an action.   <i> </i></p>
  <h5>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Progress of Proceedings</h5>
  <p class=LHeading11>Position of Moving Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties submit that the proposed appeal will not unduly
    hinder the progress of Nortel’s <em>CCAA</em> proceeding.  They state that many
    steps and issues remain before creditor distributions can be made, including
    the determination of claims.  In addition, the allocation decisions of the Canadian
    court and the U.S. court must both be final orders in their respective jurisdictions
    before funds can be released from escrow.  It is argued that this court should
    grant leave to ensure that it maintains the ability to address any issues
    should Judge Gross’s decision be varied or overturned on appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving parties also make the point that there are no operating businesses
    that are in the process of restructuring because the Nortel businesses and assets
    have been liquidated and the joint trial was a “stand-alone component” of the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding. Thus, it is argued that the traditional concerns leading courts to
    “sparingly” grant leave to appeal in <em>CCAA</em> proceedings are not
    applicable here. In fact, the Official Committee submits that where an appeal
    would have existed as of right under the <i>BIA</i>, it is nonsensical to deny
    leave here simply because Nortel’s liquidation proceeded under the <em>CCAA</em>.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings us to the final consideration: progress.  Repeatedly, the
    parties have been encouraged to resolve their differences, but without success.
    For instance, in a 2011 decision, <em>In re Nortel Networks, Inc.</em>, 669
    F.3d 128, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals admonished the parties at p. 143:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>We are concerned that the attorneys representing the respective
    sparring parties may be focusing on some of the technical differences governing
    bankruptcy in the various jurisdictions without considering that there are real
    live individuals who will ultimately be affected by the decisions being made in
    the courtrooms. It appears that the largest claimants are pension funds in the
    U.K. and the United States, representing pensioners who are undoubtedly
    dependent, or who will become dependent, on their pensions. They are the Pawns
    in the moves being made by the Knights and the Rooks.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mediation, or continuation of whatever mediation is ongoing, by
    the parties in good faith is needed to resolve the differences. [Footnote
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Former Chief Justice Winkler also encouraged the parties to find a way
    to resolve this matter. In April 2012, he warned about the “prospect of
    additional delays and the potential for conflicting decisions” if the parties
    failed to reach a negotiated settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Numerous
    mediations have been ordered but have failed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In the Annual
    Review of Insolvency, Kevin P. McElcheran described <em>Nortel</em><i> </i>as a
    case that has become “an emblem of waste and dysfunction in a system intended
    to foster consensus based solutions to commercial insolvency”, noting that it
    has “eclipsed all previous Canadian cases in both duration and expense”:  2014
    Ann. Rev. Insolv. L. 24 at p. 24. And that was in 2014.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent
    allocation decisions have been issued by the Canadian and U.S. courts.  A
    further appeal proceeding in Canada would achieve nothing but more delay,
    greater expense, and an erosion of creditor recoveries.  There are asymmetric
    appeal routes in Canada and the U.S. However, we do not accept that the
    separate appeal proceedings in the U.S. somehow diminish the need to bring these
    proceedings in Canada to a conclusion. In our view, any additional step is a
    barrier to progress. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
    fact that this case is a liquidation and not a restructuring does not render
    delay immaterial, where so many individuals and businesses continue to await a
    resolution of this proceeding. The potential of an interim distribution, remote
    or otherwise, does not alter this reality. In addition, the parties acceded to
    a liquidation under the <em>CCAA</em>.  They cannot now reject the parameters
    of that statute, which requires leave to appeal, and where the jurisprudence on
    the applicable test is settled and long-standing.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>STANDING ISSUE</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is the
    additional issue of the standing of the Nortel Trade Claims Consortium that
    needs to be addressed.  It represents a group of creditors that collectively
    holds over $130 million in unsecured claims against NNI and certain of its U.S.
    affiliates. It includes institutional investors and former Nortel employees.
    Unlike other U.S. creditors, the Consortium’s sole recourse is against the U.S.
    Debtors’ estates. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the Consortium
    was represented by the Official Committee. It says that, given the trial
    decision, its interests may diverge from those of the rest of the Official
    Committee. It submits that the Consortium should have standing to seek leave to
    appeal. It relies on the court’s jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal,
    pursuant to s. 13 of the <em>CCAA</em>, to “any person dissatisfied with an
    order or a decision made under [the] Act”. It argues that the trial judge
    exceeded his jurisdiction by deciding matters that are properly for the U.S.
    court to decide.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    unnecessary to decide the standing issue. Even if the Consortium had standing,
    we would dismiss its leave motion for the same reasons we have dismissed the
    other leave motions. In any event, we see no merit in its argument that the
    trial judge exceeded his jurisdiction. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion,
    we are not persuaded that the test for leave to appeal has been met.  For these
    reasons, we dismiss all of the motions for leave to appeal. </p>
