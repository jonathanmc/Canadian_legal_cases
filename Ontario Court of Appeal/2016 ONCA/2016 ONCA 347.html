  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on January 14, 2015
    by Justice Ann J. Watson of the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial, the appellant was convicted of sexual assault, unlawful
    confinement, and sexual interference with a person under 14 years of age. The
    sexual assault charge was stayed pursuant to <em>R. v. Kienapple</em>, [1975] 1
    S.C.R. 729. The convictions stemmed from a single incident that took place when
    the complainant was 11 years old. She lived with her mother and the appellant
    at the time. The trial took place some 13 years later. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant said that the incident occurred while she and the
    appellant were on the bed in the master bedroom. She said that in addition to
    tickling her, the appellant rubbed her stomach and torso, pulled up her shirt
    and her bra down, and then licked, touched and kissed her breasts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant admitted that he touched the complainant while the two of
    them were on the bed in the master bedroom, but testified that he only intended
    to tickle her to get her out of the room. He said he apologized immediately to
    the complainant, seeing that she was uncomfortable when he lifted her shirt,
    and was about to tickle her on her bare skin. He denied rubbing her torso, exposing
    her breasts, and touching them with his hands and mouth.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises numerous grounds of appeal:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    unlawful confinement conviction was not established on the evidence, and the

  <p class=Heading>Misapprehension and weighing of evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not identify any particular misapprehension of the evidence,
    and none is apparent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge should have treated some of
    the evidence as undermining the complainant’s credibility:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    description of feeling ill before the event, as opposed to the appellant’s
    evidence that he did not notice anything out of the ordinary;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Her
    attendance at the front door of the appellant’s home some years after the
    event, to ask for a phone number; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    failure of the Children’s Aid Society or Family and Child Services to investigate,
    since it would have done so unless the allegation was fabricated or not capable
    of belief.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge ought to have assessed
    his evidence differently. He submits that she should not have concluded that
    the appellant’s admitted actions in lying on the bed with the complainant,
    lifting her shirt, and intending to tickle her on her bare skin followed by an
    immediate apology corroborated the complainant’s version of events. He further submits
    the trial judge should not have concluded that the appellant’s behaviour after
    the event showed that he knew he had done something wrong. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave thorough and careful reasons for finding the
    complainant to be a credible and reliable witness, and for rejecting the
    appellant’s evidence. Her approach was reasoned. She explained why she did not conclude
    that peripheral issues undermined the complainant’s credibility. Dealing with
    the appellant’s evidence, the trial judge observed in her reasons, at paras. 57
    and 58:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[The appellant] was aware that the complainant was made to feel
    uncomfortable by the touching and had breached a boundary. I find that it is
    unreasonable since joking and tickling were a part of their normal relationship
    that the complainant would have been made to feel uncomfortable by the
    defendant tickling her in the fashion that he testified to. She herself could
    not recall if the defendant tickled her over her clothes or directly on her
    skin before she testified that the nature of the touching changed. However it
    is clear from her evidence that his tickling her directly on her skin would not
    have been viewed by her at the time as unusual. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I find the defendant’s evidence to be unreasonable as to why,
    when he testified he was flabbergasted that the complainant was in his bedroom
    lying on the bed and refusing to leave, he would choose to lie down on the bed
    beside her and tickle her under her top. I note that it was her evidence that
    she was developing breasts and was wearing a bra at the time. Even though the
    complainant did not think that it was unusual that the defendant would tickle
    her on her skin, why would the defendant feel the need or believe that it would
    be alright to lie beside her, lift her top and tickle her on her skin at her stage
    of development? Indeed why did he need to lie on the bed with her and
    thereafter lift her top at all in order to tickle her to get her out of the
    bed? Why did he not just tickle her over her clothes? Why lie on the bed with
    her at all? The defendant’s actions were unreasonable to this regard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In effect, the appellant is asking this court to retry this case. There
    is no basis for this court to interfere with the credibility findings made by
    the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Adequacy of reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons given by the trial judge are detailed and comprehensive. It
    is plain how she came to the conclusions she did. There is no basis to conclude
    that the reasons are inadequate. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>Unreasonable verdict</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the verdict was unreasonable because it was
    based on unreasonable findings of credibility. In <em>R. v. P. (R.)</em>, 2012
    SCC 22, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 746, the Supreme Court stated, at para. 10:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Whereas the question whether a verdict is reasonable is one of
    law, whether a witness is credible is a question of fact. A court of appeal
    that reviews a trial court’s assessments of credibility in order to determine,
    for example, whether the verdict is reasonable cannot interfere with those
    assessments unless it is established that they “cannot be supported on any
    reasonable view of the evidence”. [Citation omitted.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on <em>P. (R.)</em>, this court observed in <em>R. v. Sharp</em> (21 April 2016), Toronto, M42660, at para. 13:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The test for demonstrating an unreasonable verdict is an
    exacting one. The [appellant] must demonstrate that the verdict is one a judge
    or a properly instructed jury could not reasonably have rendered, or that the
    trial judge drew an inference or made a finding of fact essential to the
    verdict that is either (i) plainly contradicted by the evidence relied upon by
    the judge for that inference or finding, or (ii) shown to be incompatible with
    evidence that has not been contradicted or rejected. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The convictions on the sexual interference and sexual assault counts are
    plainly reasonable on the findings made by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The relevant dates </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The information, as framed, states that the offences took place between
    September 1 and November 30, 2001. The trial judge concluded that the assault
    occurred either in the fall of 2001 or January 2002. Both sides acknowledged at
    trial that the precise date of the incident was not material. They agreed the
    physical contact took place on the same date that the appellant’s relationship
    with the complainant’s mother ended, when she learned of her daughter’s complaint. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the trial judge found that it was clear the complainant
    and the appellant were testifying about the same incident. Section 601(4.1) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, provides that a variance
    between an information and the evidence adduced at trial is not material when
    it relates to the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed. The
    appellant was in no way misled about what incident the charges were in relation
    to, nor was he prejudiced in his defence.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Alleged procedural improprieties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that questions asked by the trial judge to
    clarify evidentiary issues during the Crown’s submissions were somehow
    improper. There is no basis for this suggestion.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Unlawful confinement conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not make any express findings on the unlawful
    confinement charge. Undoubtedly this is because the case was argued on an all
    or nothing basis, depending on the trial judge’s assessments of credibility. The
    Crown submits that the unlawful confinement conviction is nonetheless
    sustainable, based on the appellant having placed his arm over the complainant,
    preventing her from getting up while the assault was committed. The Crown
    submits that the appellant’s actions constrained the complainant and prevented
    her from leaving the bedroom, albeit briefly. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A conviction for unlawful confinement requires a finding that for any
    significant period of time, the complainant was physically restrained contrary
    to her wishes so that she could not move about from place to place, and a
    finding that the accused intended to confine the complainant. See <em>R. v.
    Gratton </em>(1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 462 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 473-75, leave to
    appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1985] S.C.C.A. No. 118.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent findings as to the elements of unlawful confinement, the conviction
    on that count cannot be sustained. At the hearing of this appeal, the Crown agreed
    that, in that event, it would be content if the conviction for unlawful
    confinement were simply quashed, rather than a new trial ordered, leaving
    intact the concurrent sentence for sexual interference.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is allowed to the extent of quashing the
    conviction for unlawful confinement, but is otherwise dismissed.</p>
