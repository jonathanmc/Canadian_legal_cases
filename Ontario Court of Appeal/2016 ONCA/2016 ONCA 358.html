  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals his convictions on two counts of
    attempting to possess a firearm without a licence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the Crown alleged that the appellant
    agreed to purchase two firearms from a co-worker, Donald Hare, in text messages
    exchanged between the two men while Hare was in Florida with his family in
    March 2014. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unbeknownst to Hare, the Toronto Police Firearms
    Enforcement Unit had information he was trafficking firearms. When he and his
    family crossed the border to return to Canada, he was detained and the van in
    which he was riding was searched. Canada Border Services officers found six
    firearms in an overhead storage compartment in his van as well as a Glock 30S
    in his front pants pocket. Hare did not have a licence for any of these
    firearms. The officers also seized a cell phone from Hare’s van. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While the search of Hare’s van was taking place,
    police executed a search warrant at his home. He had licences to possess 19 firearms,
    including handguns and long guns. In addition to the firearms Hare was
    authorized to possess, police discovered a Glock 23 during their search of his
    home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Police determined that the cell phone seized
    from the van belonged to Hare. They extracted various emails, photographs and
    text messages from the phone, including 31 text messages exchanged between the
    appellant and Hare, the first 30 of which were sent while the latter was in
    Florida.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, with the appellant’s agreement, the
    Crown led its case against him solely through documentary evidence, which
    included: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>a printout of the 31 text messages exchanged between the appellant
    and Hare.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not testify at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the text messages exchanged
    between the two men demonstrated that the appellant made a bank transfer to
    Hare; that after learning of the impending transfer, Hare told the appellant
    that he was going out to get some guns; that Hare later informed the appellant “have
    yours”; and that, later still, Hare offered the appellant an upgrade relating
    to an existing agreement to buy a gun. The trial judge interpreted two
    subsequent messages, in which the appellant responded “Ok ok” to messages from
    Hare quoting prices for specific guns, to mean that the appellant had agreed to
    buy the two specified guns from Hare. The trial judge relied on those messages
    to find that the appellant had committed two counts of attempting to possess a
    firearm without a licence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant raises two issues on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, he argues that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence by changing the punctuation in the text message
    relating to the offer of an upgrade. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, he submits that, read as a whole, the
    text messages amount to nothing more than a conversation about purchasing guns.
    The appellant argues that the conclusion that he agreed to purchase a gun or
    guns from Hare and thus formed the intention to possess a firearm is not the
    only reasonable inference arising from the text messages. The appellant
    contends that, considering the whole of the evidence, the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the appellant’s statements “Ok ok” in two messages amounted to
    an agreement to buy firearms is unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, we allow the appeal
    in part and quash one of the appellant’s convictions.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The text messages at issue were sent on Tuesday,
    March 11 (10 messages), Thursday, March 13, 2014 (20 messages) and Tuesday,
    March 18, 2014 (1 message). Hare was apprehended while crossing the border on
    Sunday, March 16, 2014. The single text message sent by the appellant to Hare
    on Tuesday, March 18, 2014 was unread.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In text messages exchanged on Thursday, March 13,
    2014, Hare quoted a price to the appellant for two specific guns, a Colt
    compact 45 and an AR rifle, and the appellant responded “Ok ok”. None of the guns
    discovered in Hare’s van on Sunday, March 16, 2014 corresponded to those particular
    guns.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reproduce in full below the text messages between
    the two men introduced as evidence at trial. Following some of the text
    messages, we also reproduce some of the police officer expert’s comments on the

    was whether the appellant’s responses, “Ok ok”, constituted an agreement to buy
    the specific firearms for which Hare had quoted a price – and that making such

    without a licence. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the Crown, the text messages
    supported a finding that the appellant sent money to Hare so Hare could buy
    guns for the appellant. The appellant’s responses to the prices quoted for
    specific firearms, “Ok ok” in text messages 22 and 28  and “SICK!!!!” in text
    message 29, were a clear indication that he had agreed to purchase those
    particular guns – and his agreement to do so was sufficient to make out the
    offence of attempted possession of a firearm. The fact that Hare did not have a
    Colt 45 or a rifle in his van when he crossed the border did not mean that he
    did not already have them at his house.</span></p>

    argued that while it could be a reasonable inference from the text messages
    that the appellant sent money to Hare, the purpose for which the money was sent
    was not clear. Further, the appellant’s statements, “Ok ok” in text messages 22
    and 28, were equivocal. They did not signify whether he had made up his mind to
    purchase the guns for which Hare had quoted prices. And it was not clear that
    text message 29, “SICK!!!!”, relied on by the Crown related to the same
    transaction. It seemed more likely that the phrases “SICK!!!!” and “How much is
    that?” (text message 30) related to a photograph that may have been sent.
    Moreover, if there had been an agreement to purchase the specific firearms for
    which Hare had quoted prices, one would have expected to see those firearms in
    Hare’s van when he crossed the border.</span></p>

    messages demonstrate that the appellant committed the offence of attempted
    possession of a firearm without a licence because they show that the appellant
    reached an agreement or agreements with Hare to purchase a firearm or firearms.
    At trial, the Crown relied on the appellant’s statements in text messages 22
    and 28, “Ok ok”, in response to price quotes from Hare as establishing two
    agreements and two offences. On appeal, the Crown also relies, in the
    alternative, on Hare’s statement in text message 12, “Have yours”, and Hare’s
    offer of an upgrade in text message 15 to establish at least one agreement to
    purchase a firearm. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant does not dispute that, in the
    circumstances of this case, an agreement to purchase a firearm would constitute
    the offence of attempted possession of a firearm without a licence. However, he
    maintains that in coming to the conclusion that the appellant’s statements “Ok
    ok” in text messages 22 and 28 signified the appellant’s agreement to purchase
    the firearms for which Hare had quoted a price, the trial judge misapprehended the
    evidence concerning text message 15, the upgrade text message.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that in holding that text message
    15 constituted two thoughts, the trial judge improperly altered the punctuation
    of the message. Rather than reading text message 15 as it was sent, “Upgrade to
    same as what u have available.sunday”, the trial judge read text message 15 as,
    “Upgrade to same as what u have. Available sunday.”  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the appellant, the trial judge’s
    misreading of text message 15 led him to interpret it improperly as meaning the
    two men had already reached an agreement for the sale of a firearm, rather than
    as simply an offer of an upgrade in the context of ongoing negotiations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, and in any event, the appellant submits
    that, viewed as a whole, the text messages are susceptible to differing
    interpretations and are much too vague to establish any agreement(s) for the
    purchase of firearms. When the appellant wrote in text messages 4 and 8 of
    sending something and its arrival, he could have been referring to photographs
    or even rifles (ri). Moreover, the language “Ok ok”, is inherently ambiguous
    and equally consistent with being simply an acknowledgement of Hare’s offer as
    opposed to a positive response. And contrary to the trial judge’s
    interpretation, text messages 28 and 29 could have been referring to something
    other than the previous text messages, for example, photographs or alternate
    forms of communication exchanged between the two men. </span></p>

    the suggestion that the words, “have yours”, in text message 12 referred to a
