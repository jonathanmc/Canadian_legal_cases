  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>After a trial before a judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice sitting without a jury, the appellant was convicted of counts of sexual
    interference and sexual assault arising out of the same incident. The trial
    judge applied the principles of <em>Kienapple v. R., </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 and entered an interim stay of
    the conviction of sexual assault. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The trial judge
    sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of 12 months to be followed
    by a period of probation for 2 years. The sentence imposed also included
    several ancillary orders. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>THE BACKGROUND FACTS </strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The events upon which
    the Crown relied to establish the appellant’s guilt are said to have occurred
    in the cab of his truck during the evening of Canada Day, 2013 when only the
    appellant and complainant were inside the truck. The vehicle was parked in an
    area adjacent to a housing complex. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The conduct alleged to
    constitute the offences charged consisted of hugging and kissing. Both the
    appellant and complainant were fully clothed. The appellant was 44 years old.
    The complainant was 11. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>The Case for the Crown</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> The case for the Crown
    at trial consisted of the testimony of three adult witnesses who recounted
    their observations of the conduct of the appellant and complainant in the cab
    of the appellant’s truck around 9 p.m. on Canada Day, 2013. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Each witness had an
    unobstructed view of the relevant events. Each moved closer to the truck to
    confirm their initial observations. Each described repeated kissing on the
    lips, accompanied by hugging. Each, in his or her own way, characterized the
    manner in which the appellant and the complainant kissed. One described it as
    like he would kiss his wife. A second characterized it as not the way in which
    an adult would kiss a child. And the third likened it to the way in which a
    boyfriend and girlfriend would kiss. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The complainant was not
    called as a witness for the Crown. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>The Defence Case</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The defence case
    comprised the testimony of the appellant, the complainant’s mother and the
    complainant. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The complainant and her
    mother gave evidence that the complainant returned to their home at around 5:00
    or 5:30 p.m. on Canada Day, 2013. She had been with the appellant during the
    afternoon but he brought her home around meal time.  The complainant remained
    at home for the balance of the evening. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The appellant
    acknowledged that he gave the complainant “a peck on the nose” and a hug when
    she left his truck on the afternoon of Canada Day, 2013 to join others,
    including a Crown witness, at a picnic table. She remained at the picnic table
    for about an hour, then returned to his truck. The appellant drove her home,
    arriving there at about 5 p.m. He was not with her later in the evening. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The appellant denied
    kissing the complainant on the lips. He also said that one of the witnesses who
    testified for the Crown was not in the vicinity on Canada Day. He rejected the
    claim of another Crown witness that she had approached the cab of his truck and
    had asked what he was doing. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The complainant
    acknowledged that the appellant hugged her and kissed her forehead while they
    were seated in the cab of his truck. She denied talking to one of the Crown
    witnesses at the picnic table. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>The Positions of the
    Parties at Trial</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Trial counsel for the
    Crown (not Mr. Harper) urged the trial judge to believe the testimony of the
    three adult witnesses about what they saw taking place in the cab of the
    appellant’s truck. Their view was unobstructed. They were independent witnesses
    who bore neither the appellant nor the complainant any animus. Any
    inconsistencies in their evidence were beside the point of the core features of
    their testimony. None were cross-examined about the substance of their
    allegations. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The trial Crown
    entreated the trial judge to reject, as unworthy of belief, the appellant’s
    claim that he was not with the complainant after 5 p.m. on Canada Day and, at
    all events, did not engage in the behaviour they described at any time.
    Further, the trial Crown submitted, the complainant was not a reliable witness,
    her evidence contaminated by her unwavering dedication to the appellant. For
    similar reasons, the trial Crown invited the trial judge to reject the evidence
    of the complainant’s mother whose testimony was coloured by her own desire to

    that even if the trial judge were to accept the eyewitness testimony adduced by

  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>THE APPEAL FROM CONVICTION </strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>          The Argument</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>In this court, as duty
    counsel, Mr. Gourlay raised a single ground of appeal. He submitted that the
    trial judge failed to adequately analyze the evidence to determine whether it
    established the essential elements of each offence charged. He fastens upon the
    requirement in sexual assault that the assault occur in circumstances of a
    sexual nature such that the sexual integrity of the complainant is violated. In
    respect of the count charging sexual interference, Mr. Gourlay contends that
    the trial judge erred in failing to adequately consider whether the evidence
    established that the kissing was “for a sexual purpose” as required by s. 151, or
    occurred in circumstances of a sexual nature as required by s. 271 of the </span></em><em>Criminal
    Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The focal point of the
    submissions on behalf of the parties is a single paragraph in the lengthy
    reasons of the trial judge. It is helpful to begin by setting out that
    paragraph before turning to a consideration of its adequacy. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>The Reasons of the
    Trial Judge </strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The trial judge began
    her reasons with a lengthy witness-by-witness summary of the evidence adduced
    at trial, followed by a recital of the positions advanced by the parties in
    their closing arguments. Reminding herself of the principles stated in </span></em><em>W.(D.)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> and other authorities that have followed its lead,
    the trial judge explained how she applied those principles to the evidence
    adduced at trial. In general terms, she accepted the evidence of the
    eyewitnesses about the fact, nature and circumstances of the kissing in the
    appellant’s truck and rejected the defence evidence that the conduct of which
    the eyewitnesses testified never took place. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The trial judge
    concluded her reasons by stating her conclusion about the adequacy of the
    evidence to establish the essential elements of sexual interference and sexual
    assault. She said: </span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>On the whole of the
    evidence I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of D.L. of the
    two counts in the indictment. There can be no doubt that my acceptance of the
    Crown witnesses testimony, in particular that of Ms. Clavette who saw at close
    proximity, D.L. and E.B. hugging and kissing on the lips, like a boyfriend and
    girlfriend, that a sexual assault took place, and that the touching of E.B. by
    D.L. by hugging and kissing E.B. on the lips, as described, was touching for a
    sexual purpose. Viewed objectively, in the light of all the circumstances, it
    is clear that the conduct of D.L. in hugging and kissing E.B. as described
    constituted an assault of a sexual nature and this touching as described was
    for a sexual purpose. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>          <strong>Analysis</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>As we will explain, we
    would not give effect to the submissions of duty counsel. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>We begin with the
    observation that whether the kissing that the trial judge found occurred here
    was for a sexual purpose, or took place in circumstances of a sexual nature,
    was largely a question of fact for the trial judge to determine by an
    examination of all the circumstances. As with any essential element of an
    offence, proof of these essential elements may be made by direct evidence, by
    circumstantial evidence or by both types of evidence in combination. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Second, appellate courts
    are disentitled to interfere with the findings of fact made and the factual inferences
    drawn by a trial judge unless those findings are clearly wrong, unsupported by
    the evidence or otherwise unreasonable: </span></em><em>R. v. Clark</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 9. We are unable to
    conclude that the trial judge made any error of law or a palpable or overriding
    error fact with respect to the sexual purpose of the kissing or the sexual
    nature of the circumstances in which it occurred. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Third, this is not a
    case of a single peck on the cheek, or even a solitary kiss on the lips. What
    the trial judge found occurred here were repeated acts of kissing between a 44
    year old man and an 11 year old girl characterized by witnesses as similar to
    those between spouses or lovers. This finding of fact, available on the
    evidence adduced at trial, was sufficient to sustain a finding of sexual
    purpose on the count of sexual interference and meet the objective standard
    required for sexual assault. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Fourth, while the
    reasons of the trial judge on this issue may fairly be characterized as
    economical, they do not foreclose meaningful appellate review when read as a
    whole. Recall as well that the claim of inadequate proof of the sexual nature
    of the kissing was not the principal defence advanced at trial. The defence, supported
    by the sworn testimony of the appellant, the complainant and her mother was
    that neither the appellant nor the complainant were at the place described by
    the witnesses when the kissing was alleged to have occurred. While this defence
    does not reduce the Crown’s burden of proof or lessen the standard of proof
    required, it does put the reasons of the trial judge on the issue in their
    proper perspective on appellate review. </span></em></p>
