  <p class=Heard>Heard: June 6, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on October 15, 2013
    and the sentence imposed on January 6, 2014 by Justice Donald K. MacKenzie of
    the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>By the Court:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted by a jury of procuring a 14-year-old female to
    become a prostitute contrary to what was then s. 212 (1)(d) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. She was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She appeals the conviction and seeks leave to appeal her sentence.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Conviction Appeal</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury regarding the
    elements of s. 212 (1)(d)?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his instructions as
    to the elements of this offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in relation to <em>actus reus</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s principal complaint relates to the instruction on <em>mens
    rea</em>. At trial, both Crown and defence agreed that the trial judge should
    instruct the jury that if the appellant believed the complainant was already a
    prostitute, the appellant would lack the necessary <em>mens rea</em> for this
    offence. We agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred in instructing
    the jury that the appellant’s belief had to be reasonable. However, we also
    agree with the Crown that in the context of this case, the error was harmless. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no evidence that the complainant had previously worked as a
    prostitute. The appellant did not testify that she entertained the belief that
    the complainant was already a prostitute and there was nothing else in the
    evidence adduced at trial to suggest that she might have entertained such a
    belief. In the absence of some evidence to support the belief, the defence
    could not succeed without reasonable grounds to support it. In these
    circumstances, the instruction that the appellant’s belief had to be reasonable
    was in error but it did not cause any substantial wrong or miscarriage of
    justice.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unreasonable verdict</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view there was evidence upon which a properly instructed jury
    could convict the appellant and we do not agree with the submission that the
    verdict was unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that she received a Facebook message from
    someone called “Beka”. While the complainant could not say for certain that
    that message had been sent by the appellant, no objection was taken to the admissibility
    of this evidence and the jury was entitled to take it into account. We do not
    agree that it was hearsay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there was a substantial body of additional evidence from which
    it could be inferred that the appellant had played a role in persuading or
    enticing the complainant to become a prostitute. There was some evidence that the
    appellant accompanied her male co-accused on an out call with another
    prostitute on what may be described as a grooming exercise. The appellant also
    accompanied her co-accused to drive the complainant, who had not yet
    prostituted herself, from Ottawa to Mississauga. During that journey, the
    appellant gave the complainant instructions about how to commit acts of
    prostitution. The complainant’s first acts of prostitution took place in a room
    booked by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, taken as a whole, the evidence provided a basis upon which
    the jury could conclude that the appellant had, in concert with her co-accused,
    procured this very young complainant to become a prostitute.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial judge’s comment on the appellant’s failure to testify.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with the submission that the trial judge’s comment that
    “normally” an accused who points the finger at her co-accused will take the
    stand amounted to an impermissible reference to the appellant’s failure to
    testify. The appellant’s trial counsel raised no objection and, indeed, the
    trial judge’s comment was made to deal with an objection made by counsel for
    the co-accused to something the appellant’s trial counsel had said in her
    closing. In our view, while perhaps unfortunate and unnecessary, this comment
    did not amount to an improper reference to the fact that the appellant chose
    not to testify, nor did it suggest that any reliance could be placed on the
    fact that she failed to testify. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Sentence Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the sentence imposed was unfit or that the trial
    judge failed to take into account the fact that the appellant was a youthful
    first offender. The trial judge specifically noted that rehabilitation was an
    essential objective and that an offender should not be deprived of her liberty
    if less restrictive measures were appropriate. Given the very young age and
    vulnerability of the complainant, this was a serious offense. The trial judge
    was entitled to impose a sentence that emphasized deterrence and denunciation
    and to reject defence counsel’s submission that a conditional sentence was
    appropriate. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly the appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal
    sentence is granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
